1358,WELL SOIL ABSORBS WATER GRAVEL LETS IT GO THROUGH BUT SOMETIMES UM GRAVEL UM GETS WET BY WATER THAT'S MOST OF THE TIME WHAT HAPPENS,WIL SOY ABSORBS WATER GRAVEL WHATS IT GO THROUGH BUT SOMETIMES AM GRAVEL UM GETS WET BY TE WATER THAT'S MOST OF  TIME WHAT HAPPENS
1359,IT HAS IT KEPT SOME INSIDE IT AND IT LET SOME OUT SO THAT WOULD BASICALLY DOUBLE THE MASS THE NORMAL MASS,IT HAD IT KEPT SOME INSIDE IT AN IT WETS EM OUT SO DAT WOUD BESIKY DOUBLE THE MASS THE NORMAL MASS
1360,THE WATER TO THE SOIL THE SOIL ABSORBED THE WATER,WAE TO RESORIT SO OBSERVE THE WATER
1361,IT'S ABOUT UM HOW THE SOIL CAN ABSORB BUT A LOT BUT THE UM GRAVEL CAN ABSORB VERY LITTLE,ABOUT UM HOW THE SOIL CAN ABSORB BUT A WHAT BUT THE UM GRAVEL CAN ABSORB VERY LITTLE
1362,COMES FROM US EXPERIMENTING IN THE CLASS,COFROM US EXPERIMENTING IN THE CLASS
1363,I SEE TWO TRIANGULAR THINGS THEY'RE KIND OF LIKE UM CONES ONE IS SOIL AND ONE IS GRAVEL,I SEE TWO TRIANGULAR THINGS THAT CAN MAKE AM CONES ONE IS SOIL AND ONE IS GRAVEL
1364,WE'VE BEEN UM WE'VE BEEN DOING STUFF WITH GRAVEL AND SOIL,MENT M H WE'VE BEEN DOING STUFF WITH GRAVEL AND SOIL
1365,GOOD THANK YOU,GOOD TANK YO
1366,THANK YOU,NIM
1367,ORIGINALLY I THINK THEY CAME FROM UM WELL SOIL CAME FROM DIRT WHICH GOD INVENTED AND UM SAME THING WITH GRAVEL EXCEPT GRAVEL DID NOT COME FROM DIRT,IGINALLY I THINK THEY CAME FROM A WASOYO CAME FROM DIRT WHICH GOD INVENTED AND A SAMETING OF GRABOLK IF GRAVEL DID NOT COME FROM DIRT
1368,WELL UM SOIL CAN HOLD MORE WATER CAUSE IT ABSORBS IT BUT GRAVEL CAN HOLD LESS WATER BECAUSE IT DOES NOT ABSORB IT,I'M SORRY YOU CAN HOLD MORE WATER BCAUSE IT ABSORBS IT BUT GRAVEL CAN HOLD LESS WATER BECAUSE IT DOES NOT ABSORB IT
1369,I WATERED THE GRAVEL THE WATER JUST WENT THROUGH,I HAD WATER TO GRAVEL TE WHIL TEY JUST WENT FR
1370,WELL SOMETIMES THE EARTH MATERIAL ABSORBS SOMETIMES THE WATER CAN GO THROUGH,SOMETIMES THE ARITHMETICE ABSORBED SOMETIMES THE WATER CAN GO THROUGH
1371,WELL UM IT IS SHORTER THAN THE GRAVEL BECAUSE THE SOIL ABSORBS THE GRAVEL DOES NOT CAUSE THE GRAVEL IS SOLID THE SOIL IS VERY VERY SOFT,WEL UM IT IS SHORTER THAN THE GRAVEL BECAUSE THE SOIL ABSORBS THE GRAVEL DOES NHAT BECAUSE THE GRAVEL IS SOLID THE SOIL IS RERLY VERY SOFT
1372,THAT UM THE UM GRAVEL ABSORBED ACTUALLY TEN MILLILITERS,DAT HUM DE UM GRAVEL ABSORBED ACTURY TEN MILEATERS
1373,TO UM COMPLETE FURTHER EXPERIMENTS WITH BETTER EXPERIENCE,TIT TO ON COMPLETE FARTHER EXPERIMENT WITH BETTER EXPERIENCE
1374,WELL MOST OF IT WENT THROUGH AND UM SOME OF IT STAYED ON THE ROCKS TO LIKE MAKE THE ROCKS WET WET AND YEAH THE REST WENT THROUGH,WELL MOST OF IT WENT THROUGH AND UM SOME OF IT STAYED ON DE ROCKS TILL I MAKE THE WAX WET WET AND SEE HOW THE WEST WENT THROUGH
1375,THE AMOUNT OF WATER THAT DRAINED THROUGH THE GRAVEL WAS LESS THAN THE IT WAS MORE THAN THE SOIL BECAUSE THE SOIL ABSORBS THE GRAVEL DOES NOT,THE AMOUNT OF WATER THAT DRAINED THROUGH THE GRAVEL WAS LESS THAN E WAS MORE THAN THE SOIL BECAUSE THE SOIL ABSORBS THE GRAVEL DOES NOT
1376,WELL THE WATER DRAINAGE OF THE ROCKS REALLY DOESN'T MAKE THEM THAT HEAVY BECAUSE THEY'RE ALREADY HEAVY AND IT DID NOT ABSORB,WHYLE DE WATER DRAINAGE OF THE ROCKS RARELY DOESN'T MAKE TEM THAT HEAVY BECAUSE THEY ARE REALY HEAVY AND THEY DO NOT ABSORB
1377,YOU PUT IT ON GRAVEL AND IT GOES THROUGH IT GO IT DOESN'T ABSORB ANYTHING,PUT ON GRAVEL AR IT GOES THROUGH BECAUSE IT DOESN'T ABSORB ANYTHING
1378,THE HOT WATER IS LESS DENSE THAT IS WHAT IT TELLS ME,DA HOT WATER IS WEST DENCE DAT IS WHAT IT TELLS ME
1379,UM I WOULD SAY IT GOES UP OR NORTH AND BECAUSE THE WATER PUSHES IT UP AND THAT SHOWS IT'S LESS DENSE,UM I WOULD SAY IT GOES UP OR NORTH AN BECAUSE DE WATER PUSHES IT UP AN DAT SHOWS ITS WEST ENS
1380,THEY FLOAT CAUSE THEY HAVE LESS DENSITY THAN THE WATER,FOLCAUSE THEY HAVE ON DENSIRY IN TE WATER
1381,WE'VE BEEN DOING WATER AND TODAY WE SAW THINGS FLOAT AND SINK ACTUALLY DIDN'T BUT WE PUT HOT WATER AND COLD WATER AND HOT WATER WENT TO THE TOP COLD WATER WENT TO THE BOTTOM CAUSE THEY PUT FOOD COLORING IN,WE'VE BEEN DOIN WATER AN TO DAY WE SAW THINGS FOKAN SINK ASHER WE DIDN'T BUT WE PUT HOT WATER IN COLD WATER AN HOWWATER WENT TO SAP COLROER WENT TO THE BOTTOM GOT WE PU FOOD CORIN TEN
1382,GOOD BYE MARNIE,GOOD BYE MARNY
1383,UM IT IS LESS DENSE,AM IT IS WETH TENSE
1384,THANK YOU,DANKYE
1385,UM IT'S ABOUT THE DENSITY OF THE COLD WATER COMPARED TO THE DENSITY OF THE ROOM TEMPERATURE WATER,IT'S ABOUT THE DENSITY OF THE COLD WATER COMPARED TO THE DENSITY OF THE ROOM TEMPERATURE WATER
1386,SOME OF THEM WILL FLOAT SOME OF THEM WOULD NOT THAT'S WHAT WHAT WE WERE TRYING TO DO ACTUALLY WE WERE JUST DOING HOT WATER COLD WATER,SOME OF EM WERE FOLKS SOME OF EM WERE NOT THAT'S WHAT WE WERE TRYIN TO DO AFTER WER JUS STEWIN HOT WATER IN COLD WATER
1387,UM THAT THEY ARE MORE DENSE THAN THE WATER,THAT THEY ARE MORE DENSE THAN THE WATER
1388,UM IT TOLD ME THAT THE COLD THE CORK UM WAS LESS DENSE THAN THE WATER WHICH I DID NOT KNOW,M E TOLD ME THAT THE COT THE CORK A WAS WESS DENCE THAN THE WATER WHICH I DID NOT KNOW
1389,THE COLD WATER UM THE COLD WATER IS UM IN THERE AND THE COLD WATER IS ACTUALLY MORE DENSE SO IT IS FLOATING TO THE BOTTOM AND CAN GOING ALL AROUND TOO,THE COLD WATER ON THE COLD WATER IS ON IN DHERE AND THE COLD WATER IS ACTUALLY MORE DENSE OIS FOOTING TO DE BOTTOM AND KANT GOING ON ROUND HIT
1390,WELL THEY'RE ALL ABOUT DENSITY AND WHICH ONES ARE LESS DENSE AND MORE DENSE,WIL THEY ARE ABOUT DENSITY AND WHICH ONES AR WESTEMS AN MORE DENSE
1391,M THAT UM NOT ALL OF A LOT OF THE RED WATER FLOATED TO THE TOP BUT NOT ALL OF IT BE YOU HAVE TO EVEN A VIAL KIND OF FLOATED TO THE TOP WHEN IT WAS DONE,DAT UM NOT ALL OF A WAT OF THE RED WATER FOR THE TO TOP BUT NOT ALL OF IT BEYOUR ACTUALLY EVEN A VIL CAN FOT IT TO THE TOP WHEN IT WAS DONE
1392,UM IT SINKS AND IT SOMETIMES ALSO GOES DOWN AND SPREADS,UM IT SINKS AND IT SOMETIMES ASIGLES DOWN IN SPREADS
1393,IT MEANS TO HAVE THE THINGS FLOAT INSTEAD OF MEANS UM LIKE THEY WILL SINK CAUSE THEY'RE MORE DENSE THAN THE WATER,MEANS TO HAVE TITHING AFLOAT INSTEAD OF MORS MEANS A BI THEY WILL SINK CESTER MORE DENSELY IN THE WATER
1394,UH UM HOT WATER WAS MORE DENSE I MEAN LESS DENSE THAN THE COLD I MEAN THAN THE ROOM TEMPERATURE WATER,AM HOT WATER WAS MORE DENSE I MEAN WESTENCE THAN THE COLD A MEANDIN O ROOM TEMPERATURE WATER
1395,THEY ARE BOTH LESS DENSE AND THEY ARE BOTH BOTH HAVE THE SAME DENSITY,THEY ARE BOTH LESS DENSE AND THEY ARE BOH BOTH OF THE SAME DENSITY
1396,THAT THEY UM WOULD THAT THEY ARE LIGHTER THAN THAT THEY ARE LIGHTER THAN THE UH LESS DENSE THAN THE WATER,THE DAY ON WOUD THAT THEY ARE WHITER THAN THAT THEY ARE WHITER THAN THE WEST DENE THAN THE WATER
1397,TRUE,DREL
1398,IT IS ABOUT UM HOW COLD WATER IS MORE DENSE THAN ROOM TEMPERATURE WATER YEAH COLD WATER IS MORE DENSE THAN ROOM TEMPERATURE WATER,IT IS ABOU UM HOW COLD WATER IS MORE DENSE TAN ROOM TEMPERATURE WALER YA COLD WATER'S MORE DENSE THN ROOM TEMPERATURE WATER
1399,UM THEY UM THEY ARE SINKING BECAUSE THEY ARE MORE DENSE THAN THE WATER,AM THEY AM THEY ARE SINKING BECAUSE THEY ARE MORE DNSE THAN THE WATER
1400,THE RED WATER IS FLOATING OUT OF THE VIAL BECAUSE IT IS LESS DENSE THEREFORE IT FLOATS TO THE TOP WHY CAN'T,THE RED WATER IS FLOATING OUT OF THE VIAL BECAUSE IT IS WESTTENSTER FORE IT FOLLS TO THE TOP I
1401,A GOOD THANK YOU,GOD THANK YO
1402,THEY STAY ON THE BOTTOM OF THE CUP BECAUSE UM THEY UM ARE MORE DENSE THAN THE WATER SO YEAH IT ALL IS UM IT ALL SOMEHOW CONNECTS TO DENSITY,DAYSIT ON THE BOTTOM OF THE CUP BECALD UM DEY AM  MORE DENSE IN DE WATER SO YA IT ALL IS A  AW SOMEHOW CONNECTS TO DENSITY

1458,THE IT IT DOESN'T WORK DOESN'T IT IT JUST DOESN'T DO ANYTHING IT JUST STAYS WHERE IT IS,THE I IT DOESN'T WORK IT DOESN'T INT IT JUST DOESN'T DO ANYTHING JUST STAGE WHERE IT IS
1459,THE SWITCH I JUST HAVE TO HIT IT,THE SWITCH I JUST HAVE DO HE
1460,CAUSE WE DON'T HAVE STRONG ENOUGH BATTERIES WE JUST USE D CELL BATTERIES,CAUSE WE DON'T HAVE STRONG ENOUGH BATTERIES WE JEST USE DE CELL BATTERIES
1461,JUST THAT THE POWER WAS STRONGER AND,JUST THAT THE POWER IS STRONGER AN
1462,THEY JUST PUSH IT FORWARD BUT THERE'S LIKE THIS MAGNETIC FIELD IN IT THAT'S BLOCKING IT AND JUST PUSHING IT OUT BUT THEN WHEN YOU CLAMP IT JUST AND THEN YOU LET GO IT JUST FLIES OUT,THEYOU JUST PUSH IT FORWARD BUT THERE'S LIKE THIS MAGNETIC FIELD IN IT THAT'S BLOCKING IT AND JUST PUSHING IT OUT BUT THAT'S MY OWN YY CLAMP INCES AND THEN YOU LET GO JUST FLIS OT
1463,A THE REPELLING,A THE REPELLING
1464,Y Y IF ONE OF IT HAS IRON IN IT YES,IF ONE OF IT HAS IRON IN IT YES
1465,THEN THE ELECTRICITY IS BROKEN A CIRCUIT,THERN THE ELECTRICITY IS BROKEN THE CIRCUIT
1466,MMM YEAH,O YA
1467,UM THE BATTERY WAS JUST GIVING THE ELECTRICITY AND POWER FOR IT TO FLOW THROUGH AND THEN YEAH DO IT MAKE A CIRCUIT AND THEN MAKE ALSO A MAGNET AT THE SAME TIME,UM THE BATTERY WAS JUST GIVING THE ELECTRICITYN POWER FOR IT TO FLOW THROUGH AND THEN YE DO IT MAKE A CIRCUIT AND THEN AND MAKE ALSO A MAGNET AT THE SAME TIME
1468,UM IF YOU TURNED IT WELL THE SWITCH CAN ACTUALLY TELEGRAPH THE THING YOU HAVE TO TAKE THE UM SWITCH AND HIT IT AGAINST THE METAL PART,AM IF YOU TURNED IT WELL THE SWITCH TONO ACTUALLY TELEGRAPHED THE THING YO HAD TO TAKE THE UM SWITCH AN HIT IT AGAINST THE METAL PART
1469,MAGNETIC F MAGNETIC FORCE UH I IT UM IF THE NOTHER MAGNET THEN YOU CAN ATTACH LIKE NOT JUST BE ATTRACTED AND,MAGNETIC MAGNETIC FORCE A IT UM IF THERE'S ANOTHER MAGNET THAN YOU CAN ATTACH LIT YOUR JRES BE ATTRACTED AND
1470,UH JUST LIKE ONE CENTIMETER AWAY FROM YOU,A JUST LIKE ONE CENT A METER AWAY FROM YOU
1471,IT WOULD LIKE FROM FAR AWAY LIKE IF YOU PUT THE METAL BAR FAR AWAY THEN IT WILL CON STILL DO IT AND THEN YOU CAN SHOW HOW HOW STRONG IT IS,ILIKE FROM FAR AWAVELAKE IF YOU PUT THE METAL BAR FAR AWAY THEN ILL KAN STILL DO IT AND THEN YOU CAN SHOW HOW STRONG IT IS
1472,IT'S A PATHWAY FOR ELECTRICITY,IT'S A PATHWAY FOR ELECTRICITY

1526,YOU CAN USE TWO WIRES AND CONNECT EACH WIRE TO ONE OF THE SIDES TO THE NEGATIVE AND POSITIVE AND CONNECT BOTH WIRES TO THE LIGHT BULB,YOU CAN USE TWO WIRES AND CONNECT EACH WIRE TO ONE ON THE SIDE TO THE NEGATIVE POSITIVE AND CONNECT BOTH WIRES TO THE LIGHT BOMB
1527,THE WIRES AND THE BATTERY DIDN'T LIGHT THE LIGHT BULB BECAUSE BECAUSE THEY WEREN'T IN THE RIGHT PLACES,THE WIRES AN THE BATTERY DIDN'T LIT THE LIGHT UB BECAUSE BECAUSE THEY WERENT IN DHE RIGHT PLACES
1528,YES IT DIDN'T LIGHT THE LIGHT BULB,YES IT DIN'T LIT TE LIBOL
1529,THEY'RE IMPORTANT BECAUSE WITHOUT THE NEGATIVE OR POSITIVE SIDE THE LIGHT BULB CAN'T LIGHT LIGHT UP,THEY'RE IMPORTANT BECAUSE WITHOUT THE NEGATIVE OR POSITIVE SIDE THE LIE POB CANT LIE DIED UP

2485,WELL THE NAIL HAS A MAGNETA FIELD AROUND IT SO IF YOU PUT THE MAGNET ON IT AND PUSH IT DOWN IT'S LIKE THE MAGNET WILL STICK TO THE PAPER CLIP ALWAYS,WELL THE NAIL HAS A MAGNETIC FIELD AROUND IT SO IF YOU PUT THE MAGNET ON IT AND PUSH IT DOWN IT'S LIKE THE MAGNET WILL STICK TO THE PAPER CLIP ALWAYS
2486,IT'S BASICALLY JUST IT'S BASICALLY THE PAPER CLIP IS ALWAYS GONNA BE MAGNETIZED RATHER WHAT YOU DO IT'S GOING TO BE MAGNETIZED BUT IF YOU HAVE SOMETHING TOO THICK THE MAGNET WON'T STICK TO THE PAPER CLIP,IT'S BASICALLY JUST IT'S BASICALLY THE PAPER CLIP IS ALWAYS GOING TO BE MAGNETIZED RATHER WHAT YOU DO IT'S GOING TO BE MAGNETIZED BUT IF YOU HAVE SOMETHING TOO THICK THE MAGNET WONT STICK TO THE PAPER CLIP
2487,THE NAIL ISN'T FORCING THE PAPER CLIP UP TO IT BECAUSE THE MAGNET'S OFF IT AND ALSO THE FORCE IS OFF IT SO THE MAGNET STILL HAS A FORCE AND ABSERBED IT LIKE IT UP,NAIL IS I FORCING THE PAPER CLIP UP TO IT BECAUSE THE MAGNET'S OFF IT AND ALSO THE FORCE IS OFF IT SO THE MAGNET STILL HAS THE FORCE AND OBSERB E LIHTE SWELLED IT UP
2488,WELL MOSTLY I'VE BEEN LIKE JUST TRYING TO DISCOVER WHAT ELSE IS MAGNETS BY RUBBING A MAGNET ON SOMETHING THAT'S NOT MAGNETIZED AND IT WORKED,WELL MOSTLY I FEEL LIKE JUST TRYING TO DICOVER WHAT ELSE IS MAGNETS BY RUBBING A MAGNET ON SOMETHING THAT'S NOT MAGNETIZED AND AT WORK
2489,BECAUSE OF THE FORCE IS FORCING IT TO STICK TOGETHER,CAUSE THE FOREST ITIS FORCING IT TO STICK TOGETHER
2490,OKAY SO IT'S THE GRAVITY IT'S CALLED A FORCE AND IF IT DOESN'T STICK THAT'S FORCING IT AWAY FROM IT,CSO IT'S THE GRAVITY IT'S CALLED THE FORCE AND IF IT DOESN'T STICK THAT'S FORCING IT AWAY FROM IT
2491,THE NAIL WON'T PICK UP THE PAPER CLIP BECAUSE IT'S NOT MAGNETIZED YET,THE NAIL WON'T PICK UP THE PAPER CLIT BECAUSE IT'S NOT MAGNETIZED YET

2493,NETISM BASICALLY IS VERY VERY IMPORTANT,TISM BASICALLY IS VERY VERY IMPORTANT
2494,CAUSE THE NAIL IS GETTING THE MAGNETIC FORCE FROM THE MAGNET SO FOR INSTANCE IF YOU KEPT DOING IT IT WILL MAKE THE PAPER CLIP STICK,CAUSE THE NAIL IS GETTING THE MAGNETIC FORCE FROM THE MAGNET SO FOR INSTANCE IF YOU KEP DOING IT IT WILL MAKE THE PAPER CLIP STICK
2495,IT'S CALLED A SHOW FLOW,CALLD TEY SHELFLO
2496,EVERYTHING WILL DROP BECAUSE MOST OF THE RINGS ARE GETTING STUCK FROM THE MAGNET,EVERYTHING WILL DROP BECAUSE MOST OF THE RINGS ARE GETTING STUCK FROM THE MACK INET

2670,IF YOU SET THEM DOWN IT MIGHT BE EASIER TO PUT MORE IN IF YOU KIND A JUST DROP EM IN IT MIGHT YOU KNOW MAKE IT SINK,IF YOU SET THEM DOWN IT MIGHT BE EASIER TO PUT MORE IN IF YOU KIND O JEST DROP EM IN IT MIGHT YOU KNOW MAKE IT SINK
2671,UM LET'S SEE IF W,AND LETS SEE IF
2672,AT ONE TIME YOU COULD,AT ONE TIME YOU COULD
2673,IF THEY'RE SMALLER THEN IT'LL BE HARDER TO PUT MORE PENNIES IN AND IF THEY'RE BIGGER IT'LL BE EASIER SINCE THEY'RE TALLER AND YOU CAN PUT MORE PENNIES IN WITHOUT IT SINKING,IF THEY'RE SMALLER THEN IT'LL BE HARDER TO PUT MORE PENNIES IN AND IF THEY'RE BIGGER IT'LL BE EASIER SINCE THEY'RE TALLER AND YOU CAN PUT MORE PENNIES IN WITHOUT IT SINKING
2674,IF YOU PUT THEM IN THE MIDDLE THEY'LL BE ABLE TO HAVE MORE SINCE IT'S BALANCED AND IF YOU PUT THEM KINDA EVERYWHERE IT'LL SINK FASTER,IF YOU PUT THEM IN THE MIDDLE THEY'LL BE ABLE TO HAVE MORE SENSE IT'S BALANCED AND IF YOU PUT THEM KIND O EVERYWHERE THEY'LL SINK FASTER
2675,UM THE SMALLER ONES MIGHT NOT AS HOLD AS MUCH PENNIES BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT AS TALLER AND IT'LL OVERFLOW FASTER,A THE SMALLER ONES MIGHT NOT HOLD AS MUCH PENNIES BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT AS TALLER AND TEY'LL OVERFLOW FASTER
2676,KNOW IF THEY'RE WRONG OR RIGHT,O IF THEY WERE WRONG OR RIGHT
2677,YOU SHOULD STOP THERE BECAUSE IF YOU PUT ANY MORE IN YOU'LL PROBABLY OVERFLOW THE BOAT,SHOULD STOP THERE BECAUSE IF YOU PUT ANY MORE IN YOU'LL PROBABLY OVERFI THE BOAT
2678,IF YOU WOULD LET'S SEE UM,EF YOU WOULD SAY ON
2679,WITH STRING AND THEN THE OTHER ONE'S SUPPOSED TO BE EIGHT TOO BUT IF YOU DO ONE THAT'S ACCIDENTALLY NINE IT'LL END UP BEING A LITTLE DIFFERENT,SONG OF STRING AND THEN THE OTHER ONE'S SUPPOSED TO BE EIGHT TOO BUT IF YOU DO ONE THAT'S ACCIDENTALLY NINE I'LL END UP BEING A LITTLE DIFFERENT
2680,UM IT WAS IMPORTANT TO MAKE SURE THERE'S DIFFERENT SIZES AND IF THEY WEREN'T DIFFERENT SIZES THEY WOULD JUST CARRY THE SAME AMOUNT OF WATER AND PENNIES,AM IT WAS IMPORTANT TO MAKE SURE THERE'S DIFFERENT SIZES AND IF THEY WEREN'T DIFFERENT SIZES THEY WOULD JUST CARRY THE SAME AMOUNT OF WATER IN PENNIES
2681,WELL YOU SHOULD UM,WILE YOU SHOULD O
2682,LIKE YOU COULD HAVE IF YOU ADDED TOO MANY THINGS YOU,LIKE YOU COULD HAVE IF YOU ADDED TOO MANY THINGS
2683,HOW MUCH HOW TALL THE BOAT WAS AND HOW WIDE IT WAS,HOW MUCH HOW TALL THE BOAT WAS AND HOW WHIDE IT WAS
2684,ONCE THE BOAT SUNK YOU TOOK ONE PENNY OUT AND THEN COUNTED HOW MANY PENNIES YOU HAVE LEFT AND SEE THAT'S HOW MANY PASSENGERS YOUR BOAT CAN HOLD,ONCE A BOAT SUNK YOU TOOK ONE PENNY OUT AND THEN COUNTED HOW MANY PENNIES YOU HAD LEFT AND SEE THAT'S HOW MANY PASSENGERS YOUR BOAT CAN HOLD
2685,WHEN THE BOAT,EN THE BOAT
2686,THAT THE DIFFERENCE IF THEY'RE WIDER OR TALLER THEY'LL WILL HOLD MORE WATER AND MORE PENNIES,THAT THE DIFFERENCE IF THEY'RE WIDER OR TALLER THEY WILL HOLD MORE WATER AND MORE PENNIES
2687,THE ONE THAT'S UNDER WATER HAS TOO MANY PENNIES BECAUSE THEY'RE ALL PILED UP AND THEY'RE SPREAD OUT BUT THE ONE UM THAT'S STILL ABOVE IS EVEN AND IT'LL BE EASIER,THE ONE THAT'S UNDER WATER HAS TOO MANY PENNIES BECAUSE THEY'RE ALL PILED UP AND THEY'RE SPREAD OUT BUT THE ONE ON THAT'S STILL ABOVE IS EVEN AN 'LL BE EASIER
2688,CAUSE IF THEY WERE THE SAME THEN YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW IF YOU KNOW OTHER KINDS WOULD WORK BETTER OR WORK LESS,CAUSE IF THEY WERE THE SAME THEN YOU WOULDN'T KNOW IF YOU KNOW OTHER KINDS WOULD WORK BETTER OR WORK LESS
2689,WELL THE SMALLER ONE MIGHT BE UM MIGHT NOT AS M,WHEL THE SMALLER ONE MIGHT BE ON MIGHT NOT AS
2690,IF THE BOAT IS SMALLER IT'LL BE HARDER TO PUT THE PENNIES IN SINCE IF IT HAD MORE PRESSURE AND WEIGHT ON IT AND IT'S NOT AS TALL AND IT'LL SINK WITH MORE LESS PENNIES,IF THE BOAT IS SMALLER IT'LL BE HARDER TO PUT THE PENNIES IN SINCE IF A HAD MORE PRESSURE AND WEIGHT ON IT ANI'S NOT AS TALL AND I'LL SINK WITH MOR LESS PENNIES
2691,U,I
2692,THIS WEEK IN SCIENCE WE'VE BEEN WORKING ON THE CAPACITY OF BOATS WITH LITTLE PAPER CUPS AND WE'VE BEEN SEEING HOW MUCH WATER THEY CAN HOLD AND HOW MUCH PENNIES THEY CAN HOLD,THIS WEEK IN SCIENCE WE'VE BEEN WORKING ON THE CAPACITY OF BOATS WIT LITTLE PAPER CUPS AND WE'VE BEEN SEEING HOW MUCH WATER THEY CAN HOLD AND HOW MUCH PENNIES THEY CAN HOLD
2693,CAUSE IT DEPENDS HOW YOU PUT THE PENNIES IN IF YOU KIND OF DROP EM IN THEY MIGHT BE LESS IF YOU SET EM IN IT MIGHT BE EASIER IF YOU PUT EM ON ONE SIDE IT MIGHT BE HARDER TO DO THAT AND IF YOU STACK EM EVENLY IT MIGHT HAVE MORE,CAUSE IT DEPENDS HOW YOU PUT THE PENNIES IN IF YOU KIN A DROP EM IN THEY MIGHT BE LESS IF YOU SETT EM IN IT MIGHT BE EASIER IF YOU PUT EM ON ONE SIDE IT MIGHT BE HARDER TO DO THAT AND IF YOU STOCK M EVENLY IT MIGHT HAVE MORE

2748,WELL WE,WELL WE
2749,THAT AS THE CAPACITY GETS HIGHER SO DOES THE NUMBER OF PASSENGERS,THAT AS THE CAPACITY GETS HIGHER SO DOES THE NUMBER OF PASSENGERS
2750,WELL ON THE BOTTOM IS UH HOW MUCH CAPACITY IT CAN HOLD AND THE PASSENGERS AND THEN,IS IT USUALLY THE CAPACITY AND THE PASSENGERS USUALLY STAY ROUND THE SAME AMOUNT AND THEY REALLY DON'T HAVE SOME BIG DIFFERENCE IN BETWEEN
2751,WELL WE PUT DOWN HOW MUCH CAPACITY UNTIL WE GET TO THE HIGHEST NUMBER AND HOW MUCH THE PASSENGERS UNTIL WE GOT,WELL WE PUT DOWN HOW MUCH CAPACITY UNTIL WE GET TO THE HIGHEST NEMBER AND HOW MUCH THE PASSENGERS UNTIL WE GOT
2752,WELL THEY'RE PUTTING EM IN THE MIDDLE SO IT CAN HOLD MORE BUT IF YOU PUT EM ALL TO THE SIDE IT'LL TIP OVER UM WITH LESS AMOUNT IN PENNIES THAN IT ACTUALLY CAN HOLD,WELL THEY'RE PUTTING EM IN THE MIDDLE SO IT CAN HOLD MORE BUT IF YOU PUT AM ALL TO THE SIDE IT'LL TIP OVER A WITH LESS AMOUNT ANPENDIES THAN IT ACTUALLY CAN HOLD

2755,WELL WE DID FOUR DIFFERENT SIZES SO THAT WE COULD TELL WHICH ONE COULD HOLD MORE AND WHICH ONE COULD HOLD LESS,WELL WE DID FOUR DIFFERENT SIZES SO THAT WE COULD TELL WHICH ONE COULD HOLD MORE AND WHICH ONE COULD HOLD LESS
2756,ALRIGHT SO LET'S SEE,I ANSWERED AGAIN IN INWARD  OH Y SO LET'S SEE
2757,THAT THE MORE CAPACITY IT CAN HOLD THE MORE PASSENGERS,THAT  THE MORE CAPACITY IT CAN HOLD THE MORE PASSENGERS
2758,WE DID FOUR DIFFERENT SIZES OF BOATS SO WE COULD TELL WHICH SO IF WE DID ALL FOUR THE SAME WE WOULDN'T KNOW IF DIFFERENT SIZES COULD HOLD MORE OR LESS,WE DID FOR DIFFERENT SIZES OF BOAT SO WE COULD TELL WHICH SO IF WE DID ALL FOR THE SAME WE WOULDN'T KNOW IF DIFFERENT SIZES COULD HOLD MORE OR LESS
2759,YOU WELL THAT THE MORE IF YOU LOOK AT THE PATTERN THE MORE THE CAPACITY IS THE PASSENGERS ALWAYS LESS THE CAPACITY IT CAN HOLD,BUT THAT
2760,IT'S HOW CAPACITY IS HOW MUCH WATER IT CAN HOLD,ICAPACITIES HOW MUCH WATER CAN HOLD
2761,IT SHOWS YOU WHAT WHERE THE WHERE THE THE CAPACITY AND THE PASSENGERS MEET UP ON THE GRAPH,IT SHOWS YOU WHAT WHERE THE WHERE THE THE CAPACITY AND THE PASSENGERS MEET UP ON THE GRAFT

4116,SO THESE OBJECTS THERE'S A DRY SPONGE A WET S SPONGE AND A SOAKED SPONGE AND THE DRY SPONGE IS THE LIGHTEST THEN THE WET SPONGE THEN THE SOAKED SPONGE IS THE HEAVIEST,SO THESE OBJECTS THERE'S A DRY SPONGE A WET SPONGE AND A SOAK SPONGE AND THE DRY SPONGE IS THE LIGHTEST THEN THE WET SPONGE THEN THE SOAK SPONGE IS THE HEAVIEST
4117,UM A WET SPONGE IS UM SOFT IS SQUISHIER AND UM IT FEELS SOFTER AND YEAH,UM A WET SPUNE IS UM SOFT E SQUUSHYER AN UM IT FEELS SOFTER AN YA
4118,WHEN YOU HAVE A BALANCE AND A SPONGE YOU CAN UM PUT THE SPONGE IN ONE SIDE AND PUT GRAM PIECES ON THE OTHER SIDE TO SEE HOW MUCH IT WEIGHS,WHEN YOU HAVE A BALANCE AN A SPONGE YOU CAN UMPUT THE SPONGE ON ONE SIDE AN PUT GRAM PIECES ON THE OTHER SIDE TO SEE HOW MUCH IT WEIGHS
4119,I FOUND OUT THAT THE DRY SPONGE WHEN IT WHEN IT'S SOAKED ABSORBED LIKE UM LIKE TEN TIMES ITS OWN WEIGHT,I FOUND OUT THAT THE DRY SPUNGE WIN IT WEN T IS SOAKED ABSORBED LIKE AMLIKE TEN TIMES ITS OWN WEIGHT
4120,IT'S WHEN IT STOPS ABSORBING WATER,IT'S WHEN IT STOPPED ABSORBING WATER
4121,YOU CAN USE A BALANCE TO MEASURE THE WEIGHT AND THE MASS OF SOMETHING,YOU CAN USE THE BALANCE TOO MAJUR THE WEIGHT AND THE MASS OF SOMETHING

4128,IT TELLS YOU THAT IT'S ONE CENTIMETER WIDE,IT TELLS YOU THAT IT'S ONE CENTAMETER WIDE
4129,YOU USE MILLIMETERS WHEN SOMETHING IS SMALLER THAN A CENTIMETER,USE MILIMETERS WHEN SOMETHING IS SMALLER THAN A CENTIMETER
4130,AND GENERALLY USUALLY UM TWO THINGS ARE LIKE THE SAME HEIGHTH,IN GENERAL USUALLY A TWO THINGS ARE LIKE THE SAME HITHE
4131,THAT THE BIGGEST LIKE THING WITH CENTIMETERS ON IT IS A METER THEN IT GOES TO THE DECAMETER THEN A CENTIMETER THEN A ME MILLIMETER,THAT THE BIGGEST LIKE THING WITH CENTIMETERS ON IT IS A METER THEN ET GOES TO A DECOMETER THEN A CENTIMETER THEN A MEAT MILIMETER

5443,THE ELECTRICITY WILL GO THROUGH THE D CELL AND IT WILL TURN ON THE FLAG,ELECTRICITY WON'T GO THROUGH THE DETAIL AND IT WON'T TRUMTLE THE FLAG
5444,THE D CELLS ELECTRICITY MAKES THE FLAG MOVE,PRODUCES ELECTRICITY O MAKE A FLADNOF
5445,THE ELECTRICITY GOES THROUGH THE WIRES AND UNTIL IT'S CELL AND THEN IT GOES INTERACT WHEN WILL CONTRACTION AND THEN IT MAKES THE FLAG MOVE,ELECTRICITY GOES THROUGH THE WIRES AND INTO THE CELL AND THEN IT GOES INTO THAT LITTLE CONTACTION AND THEN IT MAKES THE FLABGY WOMEN
5446,IT MAKES THE FLAG MOVE,IT MAKES THE FLAG MOVE
5447,NO NAIL,ANONA
5448,AND ELECTRICITY GO THROUGH THE TWO WIRES TO MAKE A FLAG MOVE BECAUSE THE FLAG IS METAL ON BOTH SIDES SO THE METAL TOUCHES THAT IT TURNS ON MAKE THROUGH ELECTRICITY,AVERO AN OR  EELETRITI YOU UNDER TER THE TIN WIRES TO MAKE THE FLUV LOSS BECAUSE THE FLAG IS METAL ON BOTH SIDES SO WHEN THE METAL TOUCHES IT IT TURNS ON AND MAKES ELECTRICITY
5449,THE CELL HAS BEHIND THE SUN AND THEN THE WIRES CONNECT ALL THE WAY TO THE CONTRACTION AND THEN MAKE REFLECTIVE SO ELECTRICITY GOES THROUGH THE FEW THING OVER AND OVER AND OVER,THE CELL HAS TO BE HIT IN THE SUN AND THEN THE WIRES CONNECT ALL THE WAY TO THE CONTRACTION AND THEN MAKE THE FLAG MOVE SO ELECTRICIYIT GOES THROUGH THE WHOLE THING OVER AND OVER AND OVER
5450,IT'S ON THE METAL WHERE THE WIRE IS SO IT DOESN'T COUNT ALL THE WAY BUT IT GOES ON LIKE SO THERE JUST IT IS ELECTRICITY PASS THERE SO THEY WAS ON TOP WHAT A PRETTY AS MUCH ELECTRICITY,IT'S ON THE MEDDL WHERE THE WIRE IS SO IT DOESN'T GO ALL THE WAY BUT IT GOES ON LIKE HALFWAY SOWN ELECTRICITY ELECTRICITY FASTER SO IF IT WAS ON TOP TEN IT WOULDN'T PRETTYSMUCH ELECTRICITY
5451,THE ELECTRICITY GOING THROUGH,YOUTHAUT YOU HAD REE TO MES GOON ME THROUGH
5452,BECAUSE THEY DIDN'T THEN IT WHAT IF WORK AS WELL AS A IT'S DOWN SO WHILE WE ITS DARK ANYTHING OUTSIDE WILL NOT WORK,BECAUSE IF IT DIDN'T THEN IT WOULDN'T WORK AS WELL REPO O E OS AS IT IS NOW SO EDWARD IT'S DARK AND IT'S OUTSIDE WE'LL NOT WORK
5453,IT'S NOT GOING TO TILL BECAUSE THE SWITCHES OFF AND IT'S NOT CREATING A CIRCUIT TO MAKE THE FLAG MOVE,IT'S NOT GO LIGL THROUH BECAUSE THE SWITCH IS OFF AND IT'S NOT A CRELAGA CIRCUIT TO MAKE THE FLYLEMY
5454,NO,I OL YOUWELLYNO
5455,IT'S NOT TOUCHING METAL SO WHERE ELECTRICITY WON'T GO TO THE FLAG AND IT WILL MAKE A CIRCUIT,IT'S AN ODD TOUCHING METAL SOWE ELECTRICITY WON'T GO TO THE FLAGS AND IT WILL MAKE A CIRC
5456,BECAUSE THE D CELL HAS ELECTRICITY IN IT SO WHEN THEN TWO CONNECTERS CONNECT TO THE METAL FIND ON BOTH SIDES AS THE SWITCH TOUCHES METAL THEN IT WILL START WORKING AND CREATE AND PUT IT WOULD ELECTRICITY TO THE FLAG,BECAUSE THE D CELL HAS ELECTRICITY IN IT SO WHEN THE TWO CONNECTERS CONNECT TO THE METAL FLAG ON BOTH SIDES AND THE SWITCH TOUCHES METAL THE ALL WILL START WORKING AND  CREATE AND PRODUCE ELECTRICITY TO THE FLAG
5457,THE D CELL IS AT A CIRCUIT,YOU CAN GET ANYTHING FORMORE THE DECAIL IS IT A TIRTN ADVICATE OF T TANYSHA
5458,THOSE ARE ALSO THAT ELECTRICITY SO WHEN YOU PUT TWO WIRES ON THEY AND PUT A SET TO A D CELL AND PUTTING INTO SUN THEN VIBRATING TO BE LIKE THAT ELECTRICITY GOING THROUGH THAT CELL,THOSE ARE ALSO ABOUT ELECTRICITY SO WHEN YOU PUT TWO WIRES O OD IT AND TREDUCE IT TO A DECAIL AND PUT IT IN THE SUN POCKEN A TA THAT VIBRATING THA MAKE A WARE NOISE AND STUFF THAT'S ELECTRICITY GOING THROUGH THAT
5459,IT HAS TO BE ON THE METAL,IT HAS TO BEE ON THE METAL
5460,WE'VE HAS BEEN CREATING CIRCUIT,A LEAVE BONE CREATING MISTER ROCKETT
5461,THEN IT DOESN'T WORK,THEN IT I LOO WOR
5462,THAT WHEN I TOUCH IT IT MOVES AND THEN I TOUCH IT AGAIN IT MOVES OFF THE CIRCUIT SO IT WILL PRODUCE THE ELECTRICITY BUT WON'T DOES TOUCH THE METAL AND PRODUCES ELECTRICITY,THAT WHEN I TOUCH IT IT MOVES AN THAT WHEN I TOUCH IT AGAIN IT MOVES OFF THE FO THE CIRCUIT SO IT WON'T PRODUCE ELECTRICITY BE WEN IT DOES TOUCH THE METAL IT PRODUCES ECTRICITY
5463,BECAUSE WHEN THE WIRE FIX THE D CELL AND OTHER ELECTRICITY DOESN'T LIKE CONTRACTED LIKE THEY CONTRACTED TOO,CAUSE WHEN WERE ON THE WIRE FICILITY ISREL THE VANE INE A LECTURE SINIONOS WIE CONTHARGAN MADE U TE PATRAATIVE WORK
5464,THE FLAG MOVES,SHOUL THE FLAG MOVE
5465,IT WOULDN'T WORK BECAUSE THAT'S BE SEMI AND MIKE HAS BEEN GETTING IT,IT WOULDNT WOR CAUSE IT HAS TO BE  SO SUNNY AND MIGHT HAVE BEEN HIDEOUS
5466,ELECTRICITY IS GOING THROUGH IT TO MAKE IT MOVE,ELECTRICITY AS GONE THROUGH IT TO MAKE IT INTORO
5467,THE D CELL AND THE ELECTRICITY,THE DECEL AND THE ELECTRICITO
5468,THE D CELL HAS TO BE ATTRACTED TWO WIRES TO GO THROUGH THE ELECTRICITY TO GET TO THE MOVE,STILL HAS TO BE HATUATED TENIN TE WIRES TO GO YO TOIMA TO GO IO THE ELECTRICITY TO GET TO H MILR
5469,THE FLAG STOPS MOVING BECAUSE IT DOES THE SUNLIGHT AND IT IS HAVE ELECTRICITY BETWEEN THE WIRES,THE FLAG STOPS MOVING BECAUSE IT IT DOESN'T HAVE LIGHTS AND IT IS A HEAVEY ELECTRICY BETWEEN THE AR WIE
5470,NO METAL IS PUT TOUCHING THOSE TWO WIRES AND LIKE THAT AND CONNECT STILL JUST READY TO GET THE,MEDL AS YOUR TOUCHER RL I THE IRE SO I IS  IT A MALECA AUFE TES TA TO GET OF ITLU BY
5471,I TALK TO YOU LATER BYE,I'LL TALK TO YOU LATER BY
5472,YOU'RE SEPARATE NO AND THERE ITS IT'S LIKE WE BETTER SO YEAH,YOU SHULD PUT A NAIL IN THERE IT'S ITS LIKE WAY BETTER SO YE
5473,I DON'T KNOW,I DON'T KNOW
5474,ITS FLOWING THROUGH ELECTRICITY,ITS FLOWING THROUGH ELECTRICITY
5475,ELECTRICITY IS GOING THROUGH IT OKAY,ELECTRICITY IS GOING THROUGH IT O K

5478,YOUR DOWN,YEU'RE DONE
5479,BECAUSE THERE NOT METAL LIKE ALL THE OTHER ONCE,CAUSE THEY'RE NOT METAL LIKE ALL THE OTHER ONES
5480,IT WORKS BECAUSE IT'S A METAL,IT WORKS CAUSE IT'S A METAL
5481,WE SEEN EACH OTHER BEFORE,WE'VE SEEN EACH OTHER BEFORE
5482,JUST DRAW THE TAPE THE SPIRAL THAT ROCK IN STUFF ARE ALL INSULATORS BUT A OTHER STUFF IS CONDUCTORS,THE STRAW THE TAPE THE SPONGE THE ROCK AN STUFF ARE ALL INSULATORS BUT IT ALTH OTHER STUFF IS CONDUCTORS
5483,ONE THE METAL IS TOUCHING THE SWITCH SO I ALREADY KNOW THAT,SHING LIS ONE AM THE METAL IS TOUCHING THE SWITCH SO HE ADDED IN A
5484,THE NAIL,THE NAIL
5485,METAL IS SOMETHING IF SOMETHING'S METAL THEN AND IT STICKS TO SOMETHING ALL SIDES METAL THEN IT WOULD WORK AND IT WOULD COMPLETE CONDUCTOR,METAL ITS SOMETHING IF SOMETHING'S METAL THEN AN IT STICKS TO SOMETHING ELSE THAT'S METAL THAN IT WOULD WORK AND IT WOULD COMPLETE A CONDUCTOR
5486,BECAUSE THE SWITCH IS METAL SO THAT'S METAL SO IT'S MAKE IN A WORK,CAUSE THE SWITCHIS METAL SO THAT METAL SO WAT'S MAKING IT WORK
5487,INSULATORS ARE SOME STUFF THAT'S NOT METAL BUT CONDUCTORS ARE THINGS ARE METAL THAT MAKES JUST SITTING,INSYLATORS ARE SOME STUFF THAT'S NOT MIDDLE BUT UM CONDUCTORS ARE THINGS THAT ARE METAL THAT MAKES ELECTRICITY
5488,IT'S NOT GOING BECAUSE IF THAT'S NOT METAL THEN WORK,IT'S NOT GOING CAUSE IF THAT'S NOT METAL THEN IT WON'T WORK
5489,I DON'T KNOW CAN YOU REPEAT THAT PLEASE,I DON'T KNOW CAN YOU REPEAT THAT PLEASE
5490,ELECTRICITY IS GOING TO THROUGH THE NAIL,ELECTRICITY'S GOING THROUGH WITH A NAIL
5491,ITS OPEN,IT'S OPEN
5492,ALL THE OBJECTS WILL NOT MAKE ELECTRICITY GO,ALL THE OBJECTS WILL NOT MAKE ELECTRICITY GO
5493,YEAH I'M GOOD HOW ARE YOU I KNOW YOU WE MET BEFORE BUT NO I DON'T WANT TO MEET YOU,YES I'M GOOD HOW ARE YOU I KNOW WE'VE MET BEFORE BUT YOU KNOW I DON'T WANT TO MEET YOU
5494,BECAUSE THE SWITCHES OFF AND IT'S CREATING A CIRCUIT ELECTRICITY ALL AWAY TO THAT MOTOR,CAUSE THE SWITCHIS OFF AND IT'S CREATING A CIRCUIT AND ELECTRICITY ALL A WAY TO THAT ENERTAININ MOTOR
5495,THE FLAG IS BEEN MOVING BECAUSE THE D CELL HAS TO BE,THE FLAG ISN'T MOVING CAUSE THE D SAIL HAS TO BE HOOKED UP TO THE SWITC
5496,WHEN I CLICK THE SWITCH AND IT GOES ON THE METAL IT WORKS AND GOES TO THE MOTOR CIRCUIT IT CREATE ELECTRICITY OVER THAT IT IS ON IT WON'T WORK,WHEN I CLICK THE SWITCH AND IT GOES ON THE MIDDL IT WORKS AN GOES TO THE MOTOR SO IT CANT CREATE ELECTRICITY BUT WHEN IS ON IT WON'T WORK
5497,THE CELL IS HITTING THE MOTOR SO WHEN THE CELL HITS THE MOTOR THE WIRES IT ALWAYS TO THAT CELL AND THAT IT'S START WORKING,THE SUN IS HITTING THE MOTOR SO WHEN THE SUN HITS THE MOTOR THE WIRE'S HIT ALL THE WAY TO THE CELL AN THEN IT JUST STARTS TO WORK
5498,IT WILL STOP WORKING BECAUSE IT'S NOT CREATING ELECTRICITY,IT WILL STOP WORKING BECAUSE ITS LOT CREATING ALUCTRI
5499,IT IS HAVING THE ELECTRICITY GOING TO THE MOTOR MAKE A FLAG MOVE,IT IS HAVING ELECTRICITY GOIN TO THE MOTOR A MAKING FLAG BUE
5500,IT DOESN'T WORK,IT DOESN'T WORK
5501,IT WORKS,IT WORKS
5502,IT DOESN'T WORK,IT DOESN'T WORK
5503,WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT CIRCUITS,WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT CIRCUIT
5504,BECAUSE IF IT DOESN'T HAVE IF THE SUN HAS TO HIT THAT LITTLE CONTRACTION THERE THEN IT WILL WORK,CAUSE IF IT DOESN'T HIT IF THE SN DOESN'T HIT THAT LITTLE CONTRACTION THERE THEN IT WON'T WORK
5505,WHEN YOU CLICK ON THE CELL ITS STARTS WORKING WILL A STOPS WORKING,WELL I WHEN YOU CLICK ON THE SUN ANSTART TO WOR GINGBU I LITTE CLOUDY DAY STOP FOORKING
5506,LET THE SWITCH HAS TO BE OFF,THER SWITCH HAS TO BE OFF
5507,THE D CELL IS PUT DOES THE ELECTRICITY ALL AWAY TO THE MOTOR AND MAKING THE FLAG MOVE,THE DECAIL IS PRODUCING ELECTRICITY ALL THE WAY TO THE MOTOR AND MAKING THE FLAG MOVE
5508,NO,NO
5509,AND TILL,YOR TI
5510,THE CELL IS HITTING THE MOTOR AND THE MOTOR SET UP THE TWO WIRES ALL THE WAY TO THE CELL SO WHILE THOUGH THAT CELL DOES HITTING IT IT STARTS WORKING,THE SUN IS HITTING THE MOTOR AND THE MOTOR'S HOOKED UP TO TWO WIRES ALL THE WAY TO THE CELL SO WHEN THE SUN IS HITTING IT IT STARTS WORKING
5511,WHAT,WHAT
5512,IT DOESN'T WORK,IT DOESI'T WAR
5513,THE FLAG MOVES,THE FLAG MOVES
5514,IT DOESN'T WORK,IT DOESN'T WORK
5515,ELECTRICITY,TITH ME
5516,THAT PUT DOES THE ELECTRICITY,THAT PRODUCING ELECTRIC
5517,IT'S CREATING A CIRCUIT THAT MAKES THE MOTOR RUN AND MAKES THE FLAG MOVE,IT'S CREATING THE SIKIDS THAT MAKES THE MOTOR RUN AND MAKES THE FLAG MLOVE
5518,THAT IT RUNS WHEN THE FLAG MOVES BECAUSE THE CELL IS GAIN ELECTRICITY FROM THE SUN THAT TWO WIRES ARE HITTING THE MOTOR SO WAS THE TWO WIRES MAKE ELECTRICITY TO THE MOTOR THEN THE FLAG MOVE,THAT IT RUNS AN THE FLAG MOVES BECAUSE THE CELL IS GETTING ELECTRICITY FROM THE SUN THE TWO WIRES ARE HITTING THE MOTOR SO NWHEN THE TWO WIRES MAKE A ELECTRICITY TO THE MOTOR THEN THE FLAG MOVES
5519,THAT IT'S OFF THE D CELL IT'S OFF THIS THE METAL SO IT WON'T MOVE THE FLAG,THAT IT'S OFF THE DECAIL IS OFF THE THE METAL SO IT WON'T MOVE THE FLAG
5520,IT MAKES IT WORK,IT MAKES IT WORK
5521,IT WOULD BECAUSE IT'S NOT REALLY SUNNY,IT WOULDN'T WORK CAUSE IT'S NOT REALLY SUNNY
5522,OKAY,OKE
5523,THE CELL HAS TO BE HITTING IT,THE SUN HAS TO BE HITTING
5524,GOOD,GOOD
5525,THEY MAKE ELECTRICITY GO THROUGH,THEY MAKE ELECTRICITY GO THROUGH
5526,IT WOULDN'T WORK,IT WOULDN'T WORK
5527,NOW ITS GOING THE OPPOSITE WAY BUT ITS GOING SAME WAY BUT IF WAS TURNED AROUND THEY WOULD BE GO IN THE OPPOSITE WAY,NOW IT'S GOING THE OPPOSITE WAY BUT IT'S ALL GOING THE SAME WAY BUT IF IT WAS TURNED ROUND E'D BE GOING THE OPPOSITE WA
5528,ITS GOING THE DIFFERENT WAY ITS GOING LIKE THEN POSITIVE SIDE GO IN THE NEGATIVE SIDE GOING THESE WAY SO ITS GOING TO THE POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE SIDE BUT EVEN LIGHT BULB IS MUST BE ONE TO THE THAT'S I BUT ANYWAY ITS GOING THE OTHER,IT'S GOING THE DIFFERENT WAY IT'S GOING LIKE THEN DEPOSITIVE SIDES  GO AND THE NEGATIVE SIDE'S GOING THIS WAY SO IT'S GOING THROUGH THE POSIT THE NEGATIVE SIDE BUT EVEN THOUH THE LIPE OPUSE MUST BE GOING THROUGH THAT SIDE BUT ANYWAY IT'S GOING THE OTHE
5529,LIGHT,LIGHT
5530,OKAY,O GES
5531,THAN IT WOULD WORK BECAUSE IF IT WAS JUST AT THE BA ARE THE TWO BASES OF BULB AROUND LIGHTS MUST GO UP THE LIGHT BULB SO I WERE WORK EASIER,THEN IT WOULDN'T WORK BECAUSE IF IT WAS JUST AT THE BASE OF THE TWO BASES OF THE BULB THEN IT WOULDN'T WORK CAUSE THE WIRES MUST GO UP THE LIGHT BULB SO IT WULN WORK EASIER
5532,THE TWO WIRES ARE CONNECTED TO THE NEGATIVE AND POSITVIE SIDE AND THEN THE NEGATIVE GOES TO THE SIDE OF THE METAL OF LIGHT BULB AND THEN POSITVE SIDE GOES UP IN LIGHT BULBS ARE PRODUCES THE ELECTRICITY THROUGH THE LIGHT BULB,THE TWO WIRES ARE CONNECTED TO THE NEGATIVE AND POSITIVE SIDE AND TEN THETHE NEGATIVE GOES TO THE SIDE OF THE MIDDLE OF THE LIFE OB AND H THE POSITIVE SIDE GOES UP IN THE LIEO SO IT PRODUCES THE ELECTRICITY THROUGH THE LI ALL
5533,I'M GOOD,I'M GOOD
5534,THE ELECTRICITY,ELECTRICITY
5535,TWO WIRES HAVE TO BE CONNECTED TO MAKE A COMPLETE CIRCUIT,TWO WIRES HAVE TO BE CONNECTED TTO MAKE A COMPLETE CIRCUI
5536,IT HAS TO TAKE A PATH WHEN YOU COLLECT IT,HA TO MAKE A PAST WHEN YOU CONLECT IT
5537,COMPLETE CIRCUITS,COMPLETE CIRCUITS
5538,IT LIGHT UP LIKE IN HER ON A LAMP ELECTRICITY GOES THROUGH AND IT GOES THROUGH UP AND THEN STILL MAKE US BACK UP,IT LIGHTS UP LIKE AN HERON A LAMP ELECTRICITY GOES THROUGH AND THEN GOES UP AND THEN A BOOM IT GOES BACK
5539,BOTH SIDE,BOTH SI
5540,IT AS HOW YOU ELECTRICITY WAS TO WIRES,IT AS TO HAVE ELECTRICITY WITH TWO WIRES
5541,THAT THERE IS LIKE THE ELECTRICITY THE LIGHT BULB,THAT THERE'S ALWAYS THE ELECTRICITY FLOING THROUGH TE LIGHT BOL
5542,ELECTRICITY,ELECTRICITY
5543,ITS NEGATIVE IN POSITIVE SIDE CONNECTED TO LIGHT BULB,IT'S THE NEGATIVE AND POSITIVE SIDE CONNECTED TO THE LIBALB
5544,I NOTICED THAT THE FLIP THIS THAT SHOULD I NOTICED THAT IF YOU'D PUT PUT IT TO THE NOT THE NEGATIVE SIDE THEY WILL GO UP THAT WAY BUT THE PEOPLE ON THE POSITIVE SIDE THEN YOU KNOW GO THE SAME WAY THAT IT WAS IN THE BEGIN,I NOTICED THAT IF YOU FLIPIT THIS THE SHU I NOTICE THAT IF YOU PPUT IT TO THE  NEGATIVE SIDE THEN IT WILL GO E OPPOSITE WAY BUT IF YOU PUT IT ON THE POSITIVE SIDE THE NWILL GO THE SAME WAY THAT IT WAS IN THE BEG
5545,ITS FLOWING THROUGHT THE LIGHT BULB AND TO THE POSITIVE SIDE,IT'S FLOWING THROUGH THE LIBOB INTO THE POSITIVE SAD
5546,ELECTRICITY,ELECTRICITY
5547,IF THE CIRCUIT,I E
5548,DO YOU THINK ELECTRICITY,DOTHING ELECTA SADA
5549,THE TWO WIRES ARE CONNECTED AND THE METAL IS TOUCHING,THAT TWO WIRES ARE CONNECTED AND THE METAL IS TOUCHING
5550,THEY SEE A LATER,SEE A LIGHTER
5551,BATTERY LIGHT BULB AND WIRE,BATTERY LIBULB AND WIRE
5552,I DON'T KNOW,I DON'T KNOW
5553,THE NEGATIVE,THE NEGAT
5554,ELECTRICITY,ELECTRICITY
5555,THAT THEY CAN CONNCET TO EACH OF THEM BUT IF THERE IF THE TWO WIRES BOTH AT THE BASE OF THE SIDE OF THE LIGHT BULB IT GOING TO LIGHT UP HAS IT DOESN'T KNOW,THAT THEY CAN CONNECT TO EACH OF THEM BUT IF THER WERE IF THE TWO WIRES WERE BOTH AT THE BASE OF THE SIDE OF THE LOT BULB IT WOULDN'T LIGHT UP AS IT DOES NOW
5556,THE PLY IS THAT IT HAS TO BE TOUCHING METAL WITH THE TWO WIRES AS WE TOUCHING THE LIGHT BULB THEN ORDER OF TWO,THE POINT IS THAT IT HAS TO BE TOUCHING METAL WITH THE TWO WIRES AMUS BE TOUCHING THE LIHT BULBS IN ORDER FOR A TO LET
5557,THE REALLY THROUGH THE WIRES INTO THE LIGHT BULB BACK INTO THE ONE POSITIVE,THREW IT THREW THE WIRES INTO THE LIPEBALL BACK INTO THE POSITIVE
5558,YEAH,HEASED

8470,THERE WERE THE LIGHT BULBS WERE LIGHTING BUT THERE IS THE OTHER ONE BROKE AS THEY DID A STUFF LIGHT I GET THAT THEY GOT IT OTHER ONE AND IT STARTED LIGHTING AND THAT,A NEAVER THE LIHTBELLS WERE LIGHTING BUT THEN THE OTHER ONE BROKE AND THEY DID IT TO STOP LIGHTING AND EN THEY GOT ADOTHER ONE AND IT STARTED LIGHTING AGAIN
8471,BREAK,BREAT
8472,BULB STARTS WORKING BECAUSE LIKE WITH THE SWITCH WAS OUT IT WAS HOLD THAT ENERGY FROM THE LIGHT BULB,STARED TO WORKING BECAUSE LIKE WHEN THE SWITCH WAS OUT IT WAS HOLDING THE ENERGY BACK FROM THE LIGHTMA
8473,WORK ANYMORE BECAUSE IT'S STANDARD IS DOESN'T WORK,WORK ANY MORE BECAUSE IT'S STADE ITS DEHEWR
8474,IT'S NOT A COMPLETE CIRCUIT,IS NOT A COMPLETE CIRCUIT
8475,THE FLOW THE ELECTRICITY IS GOING THROUGH ALL THREE WIRES,A THE FLOW I THE ELECTRICITY IS GOING THROUGH ALL THE THREE WIRES
8476,THERE IS A SWITCH FOR A NEW ONE,A MAYBEEL GE SWITC YE FOR A NEW ONE
8477,ANY MORE THIS CAN NO LIGHT GETTING,EBOREI AN THERE'S NO OUT GO
8478,ANY MORE,THE MORE
8479,WOULD YOU SPEAK A LIGHT IS PARTY,WOUDASTRIK O LIGHT EASE PARNY
8480,SERIES CIRCUIT,THEORY SIR
8481,SEE THAT I HAD RECEIVED A PARALLEL CIRCUIT A SERIES CIRCUIT,SEE THE I'VE SEED A PARALLEL CIRCUIT A SERIES CIRCUIT AE
8482,WE'VE BEEN LEARNING HOW TO COMPLETE A CIRCUIT,WE'VE BEEN LEARNING HAD A COMPLETE CIRCIT
8483,SO,SO
8484,INSULATORS ARE HELPFUL,INSULATORS ARE ARE HELFUL
8485,ITS STARTS TO MOVE BECAUSE IT'S LIKE LIKE HAPPY ITS ENERGY,IT STARTS TO MOVE BECAUSE IT'S LIKE LIKE HAPPY IT'S GETTING ANNER
8486,I SEE THAT THE MOTOR IS MOVING BECAUSE WHEN I PUT THE PAPER CLIP ON TOP OF THE SWITCH IT STARTED TO MOVE,I SEE THAT THE MOTOR IS MOVING BECAUSE WHEN I PUT THE PAPER CLIP ON TOP OF THE SWITCH IT STARTED TO MOVE
8487,BECAUSE IT'S NOT A SOURCE OF ELECTRICITY OR A PIECE OF ENERGY,BECAUSE IT'S NOT A SORCE OF AMTRICITY OR A PIECE OF ANER G
8488,GOOD,ED
8489,THE MOTOR IS MOVING ITS LITTLE FLAG BECAUSE THE SWITCH IS TURNED ON,THE MOTOR IS MOVING ITS LITTLE FLAG BECAUSE THE SWITCH IS TURNED
8490,THE CIRCUIT WILL RUN BECAUSE IT IS LIKE ITS METAL AND IN ORDER FOR IT TOWARDS THAT NEEDS METAL,THE CIRCUIT WILL RUN BECAUSE IT'S LIKE IT'S METAL AND IN ORDER FOR IT TO WORK AN EATS METAL
8491,ALL INSIDE IT AND THEN IT WANT,I INSIDE IT AND THEN E WON'T
8492,I MEAN THAT IS NOT GETTING ENERGY BECAUSE THE SWITCH IS AT ON AND THE WOOD STICK IS LIKE ISN'T A TYPE OF METAL SO IT WON'T WORK,MEANS THAT IT'S NOT GETTING ENERGY BECAUSE THE SWITCH ISN'T ON AND THE WET STICK IS AN NAKE ISN'T A TYPE OF METAL SO TWON'T WORK
8493,CONDUCTING MATERIALS ARE HELPFUL BUT THE REST OF THAT AREN'T WHERE IT'S TO OTHER WAY OVER CAN YOU TELL THAT MARNIE,AM CONDUCTING MATERIALS OR HEALTHFUL BUT THE REST OF THEM AREN'T OR IT'S THE OTHER WAY AROUND CAN YOU TELL ME THEM AR NE
8494,THAT WHEN YOU PUT THE WOOD ON THE WOOD STICK IT IS NOT WORKING ANYMORE BECAUSE IT'S NOT TYPE OF METAL OR ITS TYPE OF SOURCE TO MAKE IT,THAT WHEN YOU PUT THE WOT WOOD ON THE WOOD STICK IT ISN'T WORKING ANY MORE BECAUSE IT'S NOT A TYPE OF METAL OR TYPE OF SORCE TO MAKE IT
8495,IT DOESN'T WORK BECAUSE IT'S NOT LIKE STORE OF ENERGY AND BECAUSE A BATTERY WORKS BECAUSE THAT HAS STORED ENERGY INSIDE IT SO,IT DOESN'T WORK BECAUSE IT'S NOT A SWIR OF ENERGY INIT BECAUSE A BATTERY WORKS BECAUSE IT HAS STORED ENERGY INSIDE IT SO
8496,I SAID THAT YOU NEED A BATTERY WHICH HAS STORED ENERGY INSIDE IT AND THEN YOU NEED TWO WIRES A SWITCH AND A MOTOR,I A SAID THAT YOU NEED A BATTERY WHICH HAS STOED ENERGY INSIDE IT AND THEN UM YOU NEED TWO WIRES A SWITCH AND A MOTOR
8497,WELL I THINK THAT THE LIGHT THE DOTS ARE THE ENERGY AND LIKE THAT'S WAS JUST SPEAKING THE LIGHT BULB BRIGHTER,WELL U I THINK THAT THE LIKE THE DOT ARE THE ENERGY AN A THAT'S WHAT'S MAKING THE LIGHT ALL BRIGHTER
8498,IT'S JUST TO BE IN A CIRCLE IS VERY HELPFUL BECAUSE THEY HAS BECAUSE THE BATTERY IS GIVING IN ENERGY TO THE D CELL THAT'S HOW THE LIGHT BULB IS GETTING THE ENERGY IMPROVEMENT,TUR TO DO IT IN A CIRCUIT IS VERY HELPFUL BECAUSE IT HAS BECAUSE  THE BATTERIS GIVING OM ENERGY TO THE DETAIL AND THAT'S HOW THE THOUGH F LIGHT BULB IS GETTING THE ENERGY FORMER
8499,I DON'T KNOW,I DON'T KNOW
8500,THAT WHEN THOSE ONE LIGHT BULB IT JUST ONE FOCUS AND LIKE WHEN THERE IS A ONE BATTERY IT DOESN'T LIGHT AS MUCH AS THE SECOND ONE BECAUSE THERE IS TWO FOR EACH ONE,BUT WHEN THERE'S ONE LIKE ALL IT'S JUST ONE FOCUS AND LIKE WHEN THERE'S ONE BATTERY IT DOESN'T LIGHT AS MUCH AS THE SECOND ONE BECAUSE THERE'S TWO FOR EACH ONE
8501,ITS IT WAS THE LIGHT BULBS TURN BRIGHTER BECAUSE IT'S USING TWO BATTERIES AND SO THAT IS TWO STORED ENERGIES INTO LIGHT BULBS,IT'S AM IT WAS THE LIBULB'S TURNED BRIGHTER BECAUSE IT'S USING TWO BATTERIES AND SO THAT IS TO STORED ENERGIES INTO LIBULBS
8502,THERE ARE ONE TWO THREE FOUR THERE IS FOUR PATH WAYS TO A SERIES CIRCUIT,THERE ARE ONE TWO THREE FOUR THERE'S FOUR PATHWAYS TO A SERIOUS CIRCUIT
8503,I THINK THE WORK MAY BE,A I THINK I'LL WORK MAYBE
8504,THE ENERGY STORED IN THAT BECAUSE IT'S GIVING ENERGY TO THE LIGHT BULBS,UM THE ENERGY IS STORED IN STUFF BECAUSE IT'S GIVING ENERGY TO THE LIPOBES
8505,I THINK THE LIGHT BULBS ARE GOING TO BE BRIGHTER BECAUSE IT'S USING TO TUBE A D CELLS AND LIKE THEY HAVE STORED ENERGY SO IT WILL WORK,I THINK THE LIGHT BULBS ARE GOING TO BE BRIGHTER BECAUSE IT'S USING TUBE TUBE A DECEILS AND LIKE THEY HAVE STORED ENERGY SO HIYWI'LL WORK
8506,CAN YOU REPEAT THAT,I GIV YOU HURRY A
8507,FLOW IN LIKE THE BATTERY AND IT HAS TO HAS TO GO THROUGH THE LIGHT BULB THE WIRES THE D CELL AS TO GO THROUGH LIGHT HAS TO GO THROUGH IT HAS LOT OF THINGS,FLOW IN LIKE THE BAUNDERY AND IT HAS TO TR HAS TO GO THROUGH THE LI BUB THE WIRES THE D CEL AS IT GO THROUGH LIGHT IT HAS TO GO THROUGH AIR IT HAS TO GO THROUGH A LOT OF THINGS
8508,I THINK THAT IS THE WIRE IS GETTING ENERGY AND ITS GOING INTO THE LIGHT BULBS SO THE LITTLE BLUE DOTS ARE LIKE THE ENERGY COMING,I THINK THAT IS THE THE WIRE'S GETTING ENERGY AND IT'S GOING INTO THE LIFE BOPS SO THE LITTLE BLUE DOTS ARE LIKE THE ENERGY COMING
8509,IT'S TO BE TOUCHING D CELL AND THE WIRES BECAUSE THE WIRES ARE GOING TO GAIN ENERGY AND BY THAT ONE IS GOING TO BE LIKE A REALLY FUN AND STUFF LIKE THAT SO JUST GET ON THE LAST PART,TOBE TOUCHING DECAIL AN THE WIRES BECAUSE THE WIRES ARE GOIN TO HELP E GET ON ENERGY AN BY THAT FORM IT'S GOINO BE LIKE REALLY FUN AN STAF I CAN SAID HIS GUEST ON THAT LAST PART
8510,BECAUSE THEY NEEDS ANOTHER WIRE CONNECTING TO THE PLUS OF THE WIRES AND THERE ARE NOT SUPPOSED TO BE TOUCHING,BECAUSE IT NEEDS ANOTHER WIRE CONNECTING TO THE PLUS OF THE WIRES AND THEY ARE N'T SUPPOSED TO BE TOUCHING
8511,CONNECTING THE SERIES CIRCUIT LIKE IT WOULD NOT BE THE BRIGHT ANYMORE WELL IT WILL BE BRIGHT BECAUSE IT'S ONLY USED I THINK IT WON'T WORK AND I THINK REALLY WORK LIGHT BULBS,THINK THE SERIOUS SIRGE ACE IT IT WOULD NOT BE THAT BRIGHT ANY MORE WILE IT WILL BE BRIGHT BECAUSE IT'S ONLY USED I THINK IT WON'T WORK AND I INK IT WILL WORK BUT LIBALLS WOR
8512,MAY BE BECAUSE IF THE WIRES ARE THE BATTERY IS GIVING ENERGY TO THE WIRE AND THAT'S WHY THE LIGHT BULB IS SHINING AND ITS VERY VERY VERY VERY BRIGHT,U MAYBE BECAUSE IF THE WIRES ARE THE BATTERIES GIVING ENERGY TO THE WIRES AND THAT'S WHY THE LIGHT BUB IS SHINING AND IT'S VERY VERY VERY VRYORIGHT
8513,HE IS A COMPLETE FORMAT FOR A LIGHT BULB TO WORK,IT IS A COMPLETE FORMAT FOR A LIHBALB WORK
8514,IT'S LIKE THE ENERGY IS GIVING THE ENERGY IT'S CALLED TO THE LIGHT BULB AND THAT'S HOW ITS GIVING ENERGY I GUESS,IT'S LIKE THE ENERGY IS GIVING THE ENERGY IT'S GOT TO THE LIHBULB AND THAT'S HOW IT'S DOING ENERGY I GUESS

11757,THEY JUST STAY IN ONE PLACE THEY DON'T MOVE BESIDES THEY MAKE THEIR OWN FOOD THROUGH PHOTOSYNTHESIS WITH THE SUN CARBON DIOXIDE AND WATER,JUST STAY IN ONE PLACE THEY DON'T MOVE BESIDES ON THEY MAKE THEIR OWN FOOD THROUGH PHOTOSYMPHESIS WITH UM THE SUN COME CARBON DIOXIDE AND W
11758,THINK WHAT IT'S TRYING TO SHOW IS THAT SUNSHINE REFLECTS OFF THE PLANT SO IT CAN,THINK WHAT IS TRYING TO SHOW IS THAT SUNSHINE REFLECTS OFF THE PLANTS O I CAN
11759,BECAUSE GRASS AND THE PINE CONE ON THE TREE ARE PRODUCERS AND THE PLANTS ARE PRODUCERS THEY MAKE THEIR OWN FOOD WHICH THE CONSUMERS EAT,BECAUSE UM GRASS IS IN THE PINE CONE ON THE TREE OUR PRODUCERS AN THE PLANTS AURE PRODUCERS THEY MAKE THEIR OWN FOOD WHICH UM THE CONSUMERS EAT
11760,YES THEY DO NEED IT BECAUSE IT'S KIND OF LIKE WHAT THEY NEED TO BREATHE,GUESS THEY DO NEED IT BECAUSE IT'S KINDO LIKE WHAT THEY NEED TO BREATE
11761,WHAT I JUST REALLY THINK IS JUST WHAT EATS WHAT EATS THE PRODUCERS CONSUMERS AND THE DECOMPOSERS,WHAT I JUST REALLY THINK IS JUST WHAT EATS WHAT AND WHAT EATS THE PRODUCERS CONSUMERS AND THE DECOMPOSERS
11762,IT'S BECAUSE IT DOESN'T HAVE ANY WATER,IT'S BECAUSE IT DOESN'T HAVE ANY WATER
11763,I THINK LIGHT WHEN IT REFLECTS SO IT HELPS IT GROW I THINK THE WATER WHEN YOU POUR IT SO IT STAYS HEALTHY AND THE CARBON DIOXIDE WHICH IT BREATHES IN AND OXYGEN IT BREATHES,I THINK LIGHT WHEN IT REFLECTS HO IT HELPS IT GROW I THINK THE WATER UN WHEN YOU POUR IT SO IT STAYS HEALTHY AN THE CARABIN DIAXIDE WHICH IT BREATHES IN AN OXYGEN IT BREATHES
11764,I THINK THEY DO BECAUSE SOME ANIMALS EAT THEM AND THAT WILL PROTECT THEM FROM ANIMALS,I THINK THEY DO BECAUSE SOME ANIMALS EAT THEM AN THAT WILL PROTECT THEM FROM ANIMALS
11765,I THINK WHY IS BECAUSE THERE'S NO WIND AND THERE'S JUST SUNSHINE AND WATER BUT IT HAS TO BE COMPLETE WITH WATER AIR AND SUNSHINE FOR IT TO GROW,I THINK WHY IT'S BECAUSE UM THERE'S NO WIND AND THERE'S JUST SUNSHINE AN WATER BUT IT HAS TO BE COMPLETE WITH WATER AIR AND SUNSHINE FOR IT TO GROW
11766,IT HAS WATER SUNSHINE BUT NO AIR,IT HAS WATER SUNSHINE BUT NO AIR
11767,THE SUN,S THE SUN
11768,NO THEY DO NOT NEED FOOD BECAUSE THEY THEY HAVE THEY HAVE THEIR OWN PHOTOSYNTHESIS WHICH THEY MAKE THEIR OWN FOOD,NO THEY DO NOT NEED FOOD BECAUSE UM THEY THAY HAVE THEY HAVE THEIR OWN PHOTO SUBTANCES WHICH THEY MAKE THEIR OWN FOOD
11769,LIKE SOME PEOPLE SAY SO IT DOESN'T DAMAGE IT,LIKE SOME PEOPLE SAY UM SO DOEZEN DAMAGEES
11770,SOMETIMES WHEN CONSUMERS ARE EATING THEM THEY'LL HAVE TO PUT FERTILIZER AROUND IT SO THE ANIMALS CAN'T EAT CAUSE IF THEY EAT IT IT'LL KIND OF BE LIKE A GROSS TASTE,SOMETIMES WHEN CONSUMERS ARE EATING THEM THEY'LL HAVE TO PUT FERTILIZER AROUND IT SO THE ANIMALS CAN'T EAT IT CAUSE IF THEY EAT IT KINDA BE LIKE A GROSS TASTE
11771,IT SHOWS LIKE A LIKE A LIKE A SOME KIND OF OF DRINK THAT MAKES IT GROW FOOD,IT SHOWS LIKE A LIKE A LIKE A SOME KIND OF OF DRINK THAT MAKES IT GROW
11772,IT'S BECAUSE THEY DO THEIR OWN PHOTOSYNTHESIS WHICH THEY MAKE THEIR OWN FOOD,IT'S BECAUSE THEY DO THEIR OWN FOTO SYMPHASIS WHICH THEY MAKE THEIR OWN FOOD
11773,IT HAS ALL THREE THINGS WATER AIR AND SUNSHINE,THAT HAS ALL THREE THINGS WATER AIR AND SUNSHIN
11774,I THINK ANYTHING ELSE TO POINT OUT TO ME IS LIKE WHEN THE YEAST KIND OF LIKE RISES FROM THE BREAD EXCEPT IT GETS IT PUFFY FOR THE AIR OR CARBON DIOXIDE THAT FLOWS IN THE BAG,I THINK U'M ANYTHING ELSE TO POINT OUT TO ME IS LIKE WHEN THE YEAST KIND O LIKE RISES FROM A BREAD EXCEPT IT GITS IT PUFFY FOR THE LIKE AIR OR CARBON DIOXIDE THAT FLOWS IN THE BA
11775,YES IT CAN BECAUSE IF IT DOESN'T HAVE ANY SUNSHINE IT WILL TURN LIKE FIRST DAY IT WILL TURN TAN THEN IT WILL TURN YELLOW NOT GREEN,YES IT CAN BE CAUSE UM IF IT DOESN'T HAVE ANY SUNSHINE IT WILL TURN LIKE UM FIRST DAY IT WILL TURN TAN THEN ITILL TURN YELLOW NOT GRE
11776,IT'S ALL HEALTHY AND BECAUSE IT HAS ALL THREE THINGS WATER AIR AND SUNSHINE,IT'S ALL HEALTHY AND NUTR BECAUSE IT HAS ALL THREE THINGS WATER AIR AND SUNSHINE
11777,WHAT I OBSERVE IS LIKE LITTLE TINY PARTICLES INSIDE THE YEAST WHEN IT'S LIKE KIND OF LIKE MIXED WITH THE WATER,WHAT I OBSERVE IS LIKE LITTLE TINY PARTICLES INSIDE THE YEAST WHEN IT'S LIKE HILIKE MIXED WITH THE WATER
11778,IT'S A HOUSE,IT'S A HOUSE
11779,WHAT'S IMPORTANT ABOUT PRODUCERS IS BECAUSE THEY MAKE THEIR OWN FOOD AND ONCE A CONSUMER COMES BECAUSE THEY CAN'T MAKE THEIR OWN FOOD THEY HAVE TO EAT SOMETHING THAT'S WHY THEY EAT THE PRODUCERS,WHAT'S IMPORTANT ABOUT PRODUCERS IS BECAUSE UM THEY MAKE THEIR OWN FOOD AND THEN ONCE A CONSUMER COMES BECAUSE UM THEY CAN'T MAKE THEIR OWN FOOD THEY HAVE TO EAT SOMETHING THAT'S WHY THEY EAT THE PRODUCERS
11780,THAT MEANS IT'S A ALL AND HEALTHY PLANT,THAT MEANS IT'S A ALL NEUTRIATED AND HEALTHY PLANT
11781,IT'S BECAUSE THEY NEED LIGHT ENERGY CARBON DIOXIDE AND WATER SO ALL THOSE THINGS SO IT CAN PRODUCE IT'S OWN FOOD WITHOUT THOSE THREE THINGS IT CAN NOT GROW,IT'S BECAUSE THEY NEED LIGHT ENERGY CARM DIOXIDE AND WATER SO ALL THOSE THRINGS SO UM IT CAN PRODUCE ITS OWN FOOD WITHOUT THOSE THREE THINGS IT CANNOT GROW
11782,THERE IS ONE OF LIKE PARALLEL THERE IS THAT IS PALMATE AND THERE'S ONE THAT IS PARALLEL,THERE IS ONE OF LIKE PARALLEL THERE IS ONE THAT IS PALMA AND THERE'S ONE THAT IS PARALLEL
11783,SOME EXAMPLES ARE SIMPLE LEAF PARALLEL LEAF AND PALMATE LEAF,SOME EXAMPLES ARE SIMPLE LEAF PARALLEL LEAF AND PALMMATE LEAF
11784,I THINK THE VEINS ARE FOR LIKE THEY ALSO USE LIKE THE BLOOD WHICH IT PUMPS IN KIND OF LIKE THE HUMAN BODY'S VEINS,I THINK THE VEINS ARE FOUR LIKE UM THEY ALSO USE LIKE THE BLOOD O WHICH IT PUMPS IN KIND LIKE THE HUMAN BODIES VEINS
11785,I'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT VEINS FROM LEAVES AND FROM SAP FROM TREES AND ALSO SOME OTHER STUFF FROM SCIENCE,I'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT VEINS FROM LEAVES AND FROM SAP FROM TREES AND ALSO SOME OTHER STUFF FROM SCIENCE
11786,ONE IS CALLED SIMPLE ANOTHER IS PALMATE AND THE THIRD ONE IS PARALLEL,ONE IS CALLED SIMPLE ANOTHER IS PALMY AND THE THIRD ONE IS PARALLEL
11787,I THINK IT COMES FROM THE AIR CAUSE KIND OF LIKE FROM THE CLOUDS IT GIVES LIKE WATER OUT ONCE IT RAINS SO I THINK THAT'S WHY,I THINK IT COMES FROM THE AIR CAS KINDLIKE FROM THE CLOUDS IT GIVES LIKE WATER OUT ONCE IT RAINS SO I THINK THAT'S WHY
11788,IT IS THE PATTERN OF THEIR VEINS AND ALSO THE OUTSIDE SHAPE WHICH IT WAS BORN WITH,IT IS THE PATTERN OF THER VEINS AND ALSO THE OUTSIDE SHAPE WHICH IT WAS BORN WITH
11789,THAT TELLS ME THAT IT IS A SIMPLE LEAF,THAT TELLS ME THAT IT IS A SIMPLE LEAF
11790,I THINK IT'S A SIMPLE LEAF BECAUSE IT'S KIND OF LIKE HALF AND HALF AND IT'S ALL PARALLEL AND IT'S KIND OF LIKE THE SAME ON HALF,I THINK IT'S A SIMPLEF BECAUSE UM IT'S KIND A LIKE HALF AN HALF AN IT'S ALL PARALLEL AN IT'S KIND LIKE THE SAME ON HALF
11791,I THINK IT IS A SIMPLE LEAF BECAUSE IT'S VEINS ARE GOING KIND OF LIKE A CIRCULAR OUTSIDE DIRECTION,I THINK IT IS A SIMBOLIEF BECAUSE ITS VEINS ARE GOING KIND LIKE A CIRCULAR OUTSIDE DIRECTION
11792,HOW IT GETS IT'S NUTRIENTS AND THAT'S GETTING OUT OF IT KIND OF LIKE THE CARBON DIOXIDE IT'S BREATHE I MEANT SORRY THE OXYGEN IT'S BREATHING OUT,HOW IT GITS ITS NUTRIENS IN THE XCILIUMS THAT'S GITTING OUT OF IT KINDO LIKE THE UM CARBON DIOXIDE IT'S BREATHED I MEANT SORRY THE OXYGEN IT'S BREATHING OUT

11818,THEY ARE THEY ARE ALL SORTS OF CELLS,THEY AR THEY ARE ALL SORTS OF CELLS
11819,THEY BOTH DRINK,THEY BOTH DRANK
11820,LIKE IT'S KIND OF LIKE ALL IN THE DIGESTIVE SYSTEM LIKE ALL OVER YOUR BODY LIKE SOMEHOW IT COULD LIKE BREAKS IT DOWN OR HAS A CERTAIN JOB TO DO FOR THE WHOLE BODY,LIKE IT'S KIND O LIKE ALL IN THE DIGESSIVE SYSTEM LIKE ALL OVER YOUR BODY LIKE SOMEHOW ICALIKE BREAKS IT DOWN OR HAS A CERTAIN JOB TO DO FOR THE WHOLE BODY
11821,I NOTICE THAT WHAT THIS IS SIMILAR TO THEM THAT THEY HAVE CELLS,I NOTICED THAT M WHAT IS SIMILAR TO THEM THAT THEY HAVE CELLS
11822,I THINK WHAT IT'S TRYING TO SHOW US IS LIKE ONCE YOU EAT IT WHERE IT GOES THROUGH AND HOW LIKE THE STEPS WHERE IT GOES THROUGH TO BREAK DOWN ALL THE FOOD AND THEN YOU PEE IT OUT,I THINK WHAT IT'S TRYING TO SHOW US IS LIKE WI UM WHENCE YOU EAT IT WHERE IT GOES THROUGH AND HOW LIKE THE STEPS WERE IT GOES THROUGH TO BREAK DOWN ALL THE FOOD AND THEN YOU PEE IT OUT
11823,I SEE LIKE SHAPES KIND OF LIKE A AND MAYBE THERE WILL BE ALL SORTS OF CELLS KIND OF LIKE A TO TELL LIKE MESSAGES TO THE BODY,I SEE LIKE SHAPES KIND O LIKE A SPARKS AND MAYBE THERE'LL BE ALL SORTS OF SELVES KIND O LIKE A MOVING TO TELL LIKE MESSAGES TO THE BOTBODY

11827,BUT I ALSO KNOW IS JUST TRAVELS ALL ALONG WITH THOSE CELLS LIKE WITH THE FOOD HOW LIKE SIDE BY SIDE OR LIKE IN A LINE OR SOMETHING,BUT I ALSO KNOW IS JUST TRAVELS ALL ALONG WITH THOSE CELLS LIKE WITH THE FOOD CALIC SIDE BY SIDE OR LIKE IN A LINE OR SOMETHING
11828,THAT IT HAS ALL CELLS BECAUSE IT'S A LIVING ORGANISM,THAT IT HAS ALL CELLS BECAUSE IT'S A LIVING ORGANISM
11829,I THINK WHAT THOSE BRAIN CELLS LIKE THEY LIKE SEND MESSAGES TO THE BODY LIKE LIKE TELL THE HAND TO MOVE,I THINK WHAT THOSE BRAIN SOS LIKE THE UM LIKE SEND MESSAGES TO THE BODY LIKE UM LIKE TELL THE HAND TO MOVE
11830,IT'S THE GASTRIC JUICE IN THE ACID,ITS SEGASTIC JUICE IN THE ACID
11831,THE SKIN CELLS ARE FOR LIKE YOUR SKIN SO THEY STAY HEALTHY,THE SKIN CELLS ARE FOR LIKE YOUR SKINS SO THEY STAY HEALHY
11832,I THINK THEY'RE BOTH DIFFERENT CELLS BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT WORKING FOR LIKE LIKE YEAST CELLS ARE NOT WORKING FOR HUMAN CELLS,I THINK THEY'RE BOTH DIFFERENT SELLS BECAUSE UM THEY'RE NOT UM WORKIN FOR LIKE UM LIKE UM YES SCELLS ARE NOT WORKIN FOR HUMAN SELVS
11833,I'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT THE DIGESTIVE SYSTEM AND ALSO I'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT LIKE HOW IT WORKS THROUGH YOUR BODY,I'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT THE DIGESTIVE SYSTEM AND ALSO I'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT LIKE UM HOW IT WORKS I'M THROUGH YOUR BODY
11834,IT WAS IMPORTANT BECAUSE THEY HAVE TO BE GOOD IN HAVE TO PUT IN GOOD AND IF IF THEY'RE NOT WELL DONE THEY CAN BREAK,ITIS IMPORTANT BECAUSE THIY HAVE TO BE GOOD IN HAVE TO PUT IN GOOD AND IF THEY'RE NOT WELL DONE THEY CAN BREAK
11835,I THINK WHAT I WOULD LIKE TO TEST IS SEEING SEEING HOW FAR IT GOES AND SEEING THE LI THE BLOCK CAN GO BE HEAVIER,I THINK WHAT I WOULD LIKE TO TEST IS SEING SING HOW FAR IT GOES AND SING THE LET THE BLOCK AN GO BE HEAVIER
11836,I THINK IT'S,HANK YOU TOO MARDY
11837,WE HAVE SEEN A FLIPPER SYSTEM,EACEN A FOOTPER SYSTEM
11838,GOOD BYE,OODBYE
11839,YOU NEED A SOMETHING TO MAKE IT FLIP YOU NEED YOU NEED A STICK AND TO MEASURE IT,YOU NEED A SOMETHING TO MAKE IT FLIP YOU NEED YOU NEED A STICK AND TO MEASURE IT
11840,I THINK YOU WOULD JUST BY UM FOR EXAMPLE YOU CAN SAY THE BROOK HOLDS THE STICK IN AND IT MAKES IT AND YOU MEASURE IT AND IT MAKES IT GO IN,I THINK YOU WOULD DESCRIBE IT BY ON FOR EXAMPLE YOU CAN SAY THE BROOK COLDS THE STICK IN END AN MAKES IT AND YOU MEASURE IT AND IT MAKES IT GOIT
11841,IT MAKES IT A SYSTEM BECAUSE THE PROPELLER'S SPINNING AROUND,IT MAKES IT ASSISTIM BECAUSE THE PROPELLER IS SPINNING AROUND
11842,I THINK WE HAVEN'T,I THINK WE HAVEN'T
11843,WE HAVE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT FLIPPERS AND WE HAVE BEEN YEAH WE HAVE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT FLIPPERS,YOU HAVE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT FLIPPERS AND WE HAVEN'T BEEN YA YO HAVE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT FLIPPERS
11844,I THINK WHAT YOU CAN CHANGE YOU CAN,TOA HEAVIER BLO BLOCK TO SEE IF IT GOES FARTHER
11845,I THINK WHAT THAT IS ALL ABOUT IS MEASURING IT AND SEEING HOW FAR IT GOES,I THINK WHAT THAT IS ALL ABOUT IS MEASURING IT AND SEEING HOW FAR IT GOES
11846,I THINK WHAT'S GOING ON THERE IT MAKES A GOOD FLIPPER SYSTEM BECAUSE IT BOUNCES OFF AND IT HOLDS IT TIGHT AND YOU DON'T WANT TO BOUNCE IT OFF THAT HIGH BECAUSE THE THE STICK CAN BREAK,I THINK WHAT'S GOING ON THERE IN MEX ACO FILPER' SYSTEM BECAUSE IT BOUNCE US OFF AND IT HOLDS IT TIGHT AND YOU DON'T WANA BOUNCE IT OFF THAT HIGH BECAUSE IT BITS SICK AN BREAK
11847,I'M VERY GOOD,AND VERY GOOD
11848,YOU CAN ALSO UM DO A SMALLER STICK AND SEE YEAH YOU CAN DO THAT TOO,YOU CAN ALSO UM DO A SMALLER STICK AND TO SEE YE YOU CAN DO THAT TOO
11849,WHEN YOU CLICK IT IT BOUNCES OFF,WHEN YOU CLAGET IT BOUNCES OFF
11850,THESE ARE ALL ABOUT MEASURING HOW FAR THE BROOK GOES AND SEEING IF IT GOES THAT FAR,THESE OBJECTS ARE ALL ABOUT MEASURING HOW FAR THE BROK GOES AND SEEING IF IT GOES THAT FAR
11851,I FOUND OUT THAT YOU GET YOU'RE MEASURING IT AND THAT YOU'RE SEEING HOW FAR THE BROOK GOES AND IF IT DOESN'T GO THAT FAR YOU PUT THE CAPACITY YOU WRITE THE CAPACITY AND YOU,I FOUND OUT THAT YOU GET YOU MEASURING AND THAT YOU'RE SEENG HOW FAR THE BURK GOES AND IF IT DOESN'T GO THAT FAR YOU PUT THE CAPACITY YOU'RE AT THE CAPACITY IN YOU
11852,UM YOU CAN FLIP,YOU CAN DO THIS EXPERIMENT YOU CAN DO
11853,UM YOU CAN THINK OF,AM YOU CAN THINK O
11854,I THINK WHAT THE BASE IS ALL ABOUT IS MEASURING IT AND LIKE SEEING IF IT GOES FAR,ITHINK WHAT THE BASE IS ALL ABOUT IS MEASURING IT AND LIKE SEEING IF IT GOES FAR
11855,I THINK WHAT IS UP WITH THAT OBJECT WOULD BE UM SEEING HOW FAR IT GOES MAYBE,OTHINK WHAT IS UP WITH THAT OBJECT WOULD BE O SEEING HOW FAR IT GOES MAYBE
11856,UM YOU CAN THE BLOCK THAT HOLDS THE STICK IT CAN BE SMALLER OR IT CAN BE HEAVIER,M YOU KAN THE BLOCK THAT HOLDS THE STICK IT CAN BE SMALLER OR IT CAN BE HEAVIER
11857,THERE IS SOMETHING ON THE ON TOP OF IT AND THAT YOU HOLD IT YOU PUT IT UNDER THE BLOCK AND YOU JUST FLIP IT AND YOU SEE HOW FAR IT GOES,THERE IS SOMETHING ON ON TOP OF IT AND THA YOU HOLD IT YOU PUT IT UNDER THE BLOCK AND YOU JUST FLIP IT AND YOU SEE HOW FAR IT GOES
11858,IT CONNECTS IT BY PUTTING THE STICK ON THE BOTTOM OF THE BRICK AND IF IT GOES FAR YOU JUST PUSH IT IN YOU JUST TAKE IT OUT AND IT'S AND THEN JUST PUT IT,IT CONNECTS IT BY PUTTING THE STICK ON THE BOTTOM OF THE BRICK AND IF IT GOES FAR YOU JUST PUSH IT IN YOU JUST TAKE IT OUT AND IT'S AND THEN OUJUST PUT IT
11859,SPINNING THE RUBBERBAND AROUND AND SEEING HOW HOW FAR IT GOES,I THINK IT IS ALL ABOUT
11860,SYSTEMS ARE ALL ABOUT MEASURING AND DOING SEEING SEEING WHAT HOW THE SYSTEM LOOKS,SYSTEMS ARE ALL ABOUT MEASURING AND DOIN SAYING SEEING WHY HOW THE SYSTEM LOOKS
11861,WHAT'S GOING ON WITH THAT IS THAT WE HAVE TO LEARN ABOUT PENDULUMS WE HAVE TO LEARN HOW TO P HOW TO DO SCIENCE AND AND TO LEARN MORE THINGS,GOING ON WITH THAT IS THAT WE HAVE TO LEARN ABOUT PENDULUMS AN WE HAVE TO LEARN HOW TO PU HOW TO DO SCIENCE AND AND TO LEARN MORE THINGS
11862,NO SOME OF THEM HOLD TEN OR NINE,O SOME OF THEM HOLD TEN OR NINE
11863,VERY WELL,VERY WELL
11864,YOU CAN BUILD THEM OUT OF LIFEBOATS YOU CAN BUILD THEM OUT OF WOOD,YOU CAN BUILD THEM OUT OF LIFE BOATS YOU CAN BUILD THEM OUT OF WOOD
11865,LEARN ABOUT O,INABA O
11866,I I THINK I'M NOT SURE I THINK YOU HAVE TO MEASURE THIRTY CENTIMETERS ON THEM AND WE LEARNED HOW TO HOW MANY PENDULUMS THAT IT CAN HOLD AND HOW MUCH WATER IT CAN HOLD,I THINK I'M NOT SURE I THINK YOU HAVE TO MEASURE THIRTY CENTIMETERS ON THEM AND WE LEARNED HOW TOHOW MANY PENDULUMS IT CAN HOLD AND HOW MUCH WATER IT CAN HOLD
11867,ABOUT ELEVEN AND C COULD HAVE TEN AND THE SHORTEST ONE COULD HAVE EIGHT,ABOUT ELEVEN AND SE COULD HAVE TEN AND THE SHURTEST ONE COULD HAVE EIGHT
11868,I THINK IT COULD CONNECT TO THE CAPACITY OF THE BOAT WOULD BE WE CAN JUST MEASURE MEASURE EM AND IT CAN BE EIGHTY MILLIMETERS OR SIXTY TWO MILLIMETERS THIRTY EIGHT FIFTY FIVE MILLIMETERS,I THINK IT CU CONNECT OTHE CAPACITY OF THE BOW WOULD BE YOU CAN JUST MEASURE MEASURE IM AND IT CAN BE EIGHTY MILLIMETERS OR SIXTY TWO MILLIMETERS THIRTY EIGHT FIFTY FIVE MILLIMETERS
11869,BYE,Y
11870,I'VE BUILT MINE OUT OF PA OUT OF PAPER CUPS,IBUILT MINE OUT OF PAIT OUT OF PAPER CUPS
11871,FIRST YOU HAVE TO MEASURE A THE BOAT AND SEE AND PUT IT IN THE WATER AND YOU I THINK YOU MEASURE THIRTY CENTIMETERS ON THEM AND THEN YOU'D NEED TO,FIRST YOU HAVE TO MEASURE UP THE BOW AND SEE AND PUT IT IN THE WATER AND IHT THINK YOU MEASURE THIRTY CENTIMETERS ON THEM AND THEN YOU METO
11872,WHY I THINK THEY GOT A DIFFERENT NUMBER OF PENNIES IS BECAUSE THEY CUTTED THEM SHORTER OR LONGER,WHY I THINK THEY GOT A DIFFERENT NUMBER OF PENNIS ES BECAUSE THEY CAUGHT AT THEM SHORTER OR LONGER
11873,I WOULD THINK ABOUT PUTTING PENNIES IN IT OR WATER,WOULD THINK ABOUT PUTTING PENNIES IN IT OR WATER
11874,I DISCOVERED THAT THE BOAT CAN FIT TWELVE TWELVE PENDULUMS IN THE LITTLE BOAT,DISCOVERED THAT THE BOW KINFETE TWELVE TWELVE PENDILUMSN IN THE LITTLE BOOK
11875,WHEN I WHEN I NOTICED THAT A WASN'T DROWNING THAT MUCH I STARTED PUTTING MORE AND MORE UH PENDULUMS IN EM AND WHEN I DROWNED IT I I GOT MY ANSWER REALLY EASILY,WHEN I WHEN I NOTICED THAT A WASN'T DROWNING THAT MUCH I STARTED PUTTING MORE AND MORE PENDULUMS IN EM AND WHEN ID DROWNEDID I I GOT MY ANSWER REALLY EASILY
11876,WE HAVE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT BOATS AND WE HAVE BEEN PUTTING PENDULUMS IN THE BOATS AND SEEING HOW MANY PENDULUMS CAN FIT INSIDE THE LITTLE BOAT,WE HAVE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT BOATS AND WE HAVE BEEN PUTTING PENDULUMS IN THE BOATS AND SEEING HOW MANY PENDULUMS CAN FAD INSIDE THE LITTLE BOAT
11877,WE,WE
11878,THE LIFEBOATS ARE ALL ABOUT YOU GO YOU CAN GO ON A ROMANTIC DATE YOU CAN,AN GO TO THE RIVER AN GET ON THEM YOU CAN HAVE A PICNIC IN THEM
11879,WHAT IS GOING ON THERE IS THE PROPELLER IS THE STRING IS MAKING IT BALANCE IT AND IT KEEPS GOING AROUND AND AROUND PROPELLER KEEPS GOING AROUND AND AROUND,WHAT IS GOING ON THERE IS THE PROPELLERIS THE STRING IS MAKING AT BALANCE E AND IT KEEPS GOING AROUND AND AROUND THE PROPELLER KEEPS GOING AROUND AND AROUND
11880,I THINK IT WILL BECAUSE IT HAS TO HAVE MORE POWER ON IT AND IT HAS TO GO UP FARTHER AND I THINK THAT WOULD AFFECT IT,I THINK IT WILL BECAUSE IT HAS TO HAVE MORE POWER ON IT AND IT HAS TO GO UP FARTHER AND I THINK THAT WOULD AFFECT IT
11881,SO IT HAS ALSO BEEN NICE TALKING TO YOU MARTY,UL IT HAS ALSO BEEN NICE TACKING TO YOU MARTY
11882,WHAT WE'VE BEEN DOING IN SCIENCE WE WERE WE HAVE BEEN DOING AIRPLANES WE HAVE BEEN SEEING IS THE AIRPLANE PROPELLER CAN FLY,WHAT WE'VE BEEN DOING IN SCIENCE WITH WHAT WE HAVE BEEN DOING AEIROPLANES ANDWE HAVE BEEN SEEING IF THE AEROPLANE PROPELLER CAN FLY
11883,THANK YOU,ANK YIM
11884,THANK YOU,THANK YOU
11885,I THINK WHEN SETTING UP YOUR MY EXPERIMENT WAS IT WAS TRICKY TO PUT IT TOGETHER BUT IT WORKED REALLY WELL AND,I THINK WHEN SETTING UP ERE IT MY EXPERIMENT WAS IT WAS TRICKY TO PUT IT TOGETHER BUT IT WORKED REALLY WELL AND
11886,IT'S GOING VERY WELL MARTY,GOING VERY WELL MARTY
11887,YOU CAN ALSO CHANGE THE PROPELLER YOU CAN USE FISHING YOU CAN USE FISHING WIRE AND YOU CAN MAKE THE PROPELLER SMALLER YOU CAN MAKE THE THE,YES
11888,YOU,YOU
11889,OKAY SO HOW MANY SPINS IT TAKES SPINS ARE FORTY FIVE SPINS IT MADE AND THE DISTANCE IS HOW MUCH METER HOW MUCH METERS YOU MEASURE IT,O KASO HOW MANY SPINS IT TAKES SPINS ARE FORTY FIVE SPINS IT MADE AND THE DISTANCE IS HOW MUCH METER HOW MUCH METERS YOU MEASURE IT
11890,SO WHAT THE PARTS OF THE PLANE I USE THE PROPELLER IS MAKING IT SPIN AND THE STRING THE STRAW AND THE STRING IS MAKING IT BALANCE IT,SO WHE THE PARTS OF THE PLANE ARE USED THE PROPELLER IS MAKING IT SPIN AND THE STRING THE STRAW IN THE STRING IS MAKING IT BALANCE IT
11891,I THINK THE KINDS OF THINGS THAT ARE IMPORTANT WHAT MAKES IF FLY IS THE PROPELLER MAKES IT FLY AND THAT THE STRING IS BALANCED AND A AND THAT THE STRAW IS GREAT IS PUT GOOD ON IT,I THINK THE KINDS OF THINGS THAT ARE IMPORTANT WHAT MAKES IT FLY IS A PROPELLER MAKES IT FLY AND THAT THE STRING IS BALANCED AND A AND THAT THE STRAW IS GRIT IS PUK GOOD ON IT
11892,I THINK WHAT THAT IS ALL ABOUT IT MAKES THE PROPELLER SPIN AND IF WE DON'T HAVE THE RUBBER BAND IN THE BOTTOM IT'S NOT GOING TO WORK,I THINK WHAT THAT IS ALL ABOUT IT MAKES THE PROPELLER SPIN AND IF WE DON'T HAVE THE RIVER RUNIN TE WATERMIT'S SINKIN O WORK
11893,YOU HAVE TO THE PROPELLER IS ALL ABOUT MAKING THE PROPELLER SPIN,YOU HAVE TO THE PROPELLER IS ALL ABOUT MAKING THE PROPELLER SPIN
11894,WHEN IT SPINS THE THING ON THE BOTTOM SPINS AROUND TOO WITH IT AND M AND THEN YOU MEASURE HOW MUCH FAR IT WENT,WHEN IT SPINS THE THING ON THE BOTTOM SPINS AROUND TOO WITH IT AND IM AND THEN YOU MEASURE HOW MUCH FAR IT WENT
11895,I THINK THE NUMBER OF SWINGS ISN'T RIGHT BECAUSE YOU HA ALSO THE STRING HAS TO BE BALANCED AND THE PROPELLER HAS TO BE MOVING,I THINK THE NUMBER OF SWINGS IS AN RIGHT BECAUSE YOU ALSO THE STRING HAS TO BE BALANCED AND THE PROPELLER HAS TO BE MOVING
11896,WITH STRING,STRENGH
11897,THANK YOU,THANK
11898,MARNIE,ARDY
11899,I THINK WHAT IS IMPORTANT ABOUT THE FLYING LINE IS BECAUSE AND IT ATTACHES TO IT AND IT MAKES IT BALANCE AND IF E YOU DON'T HAVE IT ON THE BOTTOM IT'S GONNA NOT GO THAT FAST,I THINK WHAT IS IMPORTANT ABOUT THE FLYIN LINE IS BECAUSE IM A ATTACHES TO IT AN IT MAKES IT BALANCE AN IF YOU DON'T HAVE IT ON THE BOTTOM IT'S GINNA NO GO THAT FAST
11900,OKAY,
11901,WHAT YOU CAN ALSO DO WHEN THE PARTS ARE ALL WORKING TOGETHER IS YOU CAN PUT THE STRING INTO THE STRAW AND THEN YOU CAN JUST SWING IT ACROSS AND IT BALANCE IT AND IF IT DOESN'T BALANCE IT'S GOING TO WIGGLE A LOT,WHAT YOU CAN ALSO DO WHEN THE PARTS ARE ALL WORKING TOGETHER IS YOU CAN PUT THE STRING INTO THE STRAW AND THEN YOU CAN JUST SWING IT ACROSS AND IT BALANCE IT AN IF IT DOESN'T BALANCE IT'S GOIN TO WAKE AL UP
11902,OKAY,KE
11903,I THINK THAT IF THE STRING ISN'T BALANCED THAT WELL IT'S NOT GONNA WORK IT'S NOT GONNA SPIN IT'S IT'S IT'S JUST NOT GONNA WORK,I THINK THA IF THE STRING IS'N'T BALANCED THAT WELL IT'S NOT GOIN TO WORK IT'S NOT GINA SPIN IT'S IT'S JUST NOT GIN TO WORK
11904,YEAH THAT'S IT,THE PROPELLER ON IT AND THEN YOU NEED TO JEST STAPLE THE TWO OTHER OTHER UM
11905,I AM VERY WELL HOW ARE YOU MARNIE,AND WERY WELL HOW ARE YOU MARTY
11906,I THINK THE OTHER THINGS THAT ARE IMPORTANT WHEN YOU ARE FLYING YOUR PLANE IS THAT IT'S REALLY BALANCED AND IT'S NOT WIGGLING A LOT AND THAT YOUR PROPELLER SPINS,I THINK THE OTHER THINGS THAT AREN'T IMPORTANT WHEN YOU'RE FLYING YOU'RE PLAN IS THAT IT'S REALLY BALANCED IN IT'S NOT WHENWIGGLING A LO N THAT YOUR PROPELLER SPINS
11907,I THINK THE PROPELLERS ARE ALL ABOUT I AM GUESSING THAT THE PROPELLERS ARE TO KEEP IT BALANCED,I THINK THE PROPELLERS ARE ALL ABOUT I AM GUESSING THAT THE PROPELLERS ARE TO KEEP IT BALANCED
11908,ME TOO,ME TOO
