1293,WELL JUNGLE IS FOR MOISTNESS CAUSE IT HAS MORE RAIN BUT DESERT HAS EVEN IF YOU DID PUT A LITTLE WATER THERE IT'D EVAPORATE REALLY QUICKLY CAUSE THE TEMPERATURE IS SO HOT,THE  MBVEN WATERINT TEMTERS SOH
1294,DIFFERENT,
1295,WHEN IT'S WARM IT LOSES MORE BECAUSE UM WHEN IT'S WARM THAT HELPS THE EVAPORATION,HBCPS EEVATION
1296,IT WOULD EASILY COME AND EVAPORATE THE WATER,WL EASERM NEERATER
1297,WHEN THE AIR'S FULL OF MOISTURE OR WHEN IT'S HUMID WHEN WELL WHEN THE AIR IS FULL OF MOISTURE IT HAS LESS CHANCE OF EVAPORATING BUT IT'S HUMID IT HAS A WAY BETTER CHANCE OF EVAPORATING,WTHE A MWAMI BETER TASERATION
1298,UM BECAUSE IT'S PUSHING IT AWAY FROM THE HEAT,BECAUSE  PUSHIN FROMTH
1299,IT EVAPORATES AND SOMETIMES IT MAKES A LITTLE RAIN CLOUD,ERATE  SOTESN MAKES A CA
1300,IT EVAPORATES LESS THAN THE DESERT,OPERATES IN THE DESERT

1376,WELL THE WATER DRAINAGE OF THE ROCKS REALLY DOESN'T MAKE THEM THAT HEAVY BECAUSE THEY'RE ALREADY HEAVY AND IT DID NOT ABSORB,THE WATER RAMO THEOKA DOESBECAUSE READYSR
1377,YOU PUT IT ON GRAVEL AND IT GOES THROUGH IT GO IT DOESN'T ABSORB ANYTHING,PT ON GAOS FN
1378,THE HOT WATER IS LESS DENSE THAT IS WHAT IT TELLS ME,THE HAT WATER IS
1379,UM I WOULD SAY IT GOES UP OR NORTH AND BECAUSE THE WATER PUSHES IT UP AND THAT SHOWS IT'S LESS DENSE,I GBCAS THE WATERPUSH SR AM
1380,THEY FLOAT CAUSE THEY HAVE LESS DENSITY THAN THE WATER,ASEIN THE WATER
1381,WE'VE BEEN DOING WATER AND TODAY WE SAW THINGS FLOAT AND SINK ACTUALLY DIDN'T BUT WE PUT HOT WATER AND COLD WATER AND HOT WATER WENT TO THE TOP COLD WATER WENT TO THE BOTTOM CAUSE THEY PUT FOOD COLORING IN,WEVN WATER INDE  COLD WATER N
1382,GOOD BYE MARNIE,BONEY
1383,UM IT IS LESS DENSE,ET
1384,THANK YOU,SE
1385,UM IT'S ABOUT THE DENSITY OF THE COLD WATER COMPARED TO THE DENSITY OF THE ROOM TEMPERATURE WATER,B EF TH COLD WATER CPER TOEMWATER
1386,SOME OF THEM WILL FLOAT SOME OF THEM WOULD NOT THAT'S WHAT WHAT WE WERE TRYING TO DO ACTUALLY WE WERE JUST DOING HOT WATER COLD WATER,SOMEORTE
1387,UM THAT THEY ARE MORE DENSE THAN THE WATER,T THE WATER
1388,UM IT TOLD ME THAT THE COLD THE CORK UM WAS LESS DENSE THAN THE WATER WHICH I DID NOT KNOW,VM THE WATERHNNO

1515,THE ELECTROMAG YEAH,
1516,THE BAR IRON SOME SORT OF METAL THAT MAGNETS LIKE AND THAT STUFF THAT ATTRACT LIKE,THE B SOME SIRTOF MET STA TRACT
1517,THE BUT WHAT THE PROBLEM IS IS THAT WE ONLY HAD JUST THREE WIRES SO WE CAN'T USE THREE WIRES TO A TO ATTACH TWO BATTERIES TO THE SWITCH,THEEEONLY A TETHECH TOTS

1871,HOW I'M DOING TODAY THAT'S MY BUSINESS MIND YOUR OWN,EILL HAEM ING TY BIS
1872,A SOLVENT AND A SOLUTE,THE OENT IN A SO
1873,WE ARE TRY WE ARE TRYING TO SATURATE THE WATER WITH SUGAR,WEWEAUR TRYING TO SARAT H WATER WITH AR
1874,MEANS THAT THE SOLUTION IS SATURATED,THE ILLUSION IS AEATED
1875,THAT MEANS THAT THE SOLUTION IS SATURATED,THAT MEANS ILLUSION IS ZAERATED
1876,SOME OF THE EPSOM SALTS ARE ON THE BOTTOM OF THE CONTAINER,SOMEE THE EA ON THE BOTOM O THE COA
1877,THE SOLUTIONS HAVE TO WEIGH THE SAME,THEILLUSION A THE
1878,I FIGURED IT OUT BY TAKING THE SIXTY SEVEN GRAMS AND SUBTRACTING FIFTY GRAMS FROM AND GETTING SEVENTEEN GRAMS,FERD BAKNG SIXT SEVEN RABTRACTN FIFTY GRAMS FROM THE EIN SEVEN
1879,FIFTY MILLILITERS OF SALT SOLUTION IS MORE CONCENTRATED THAN THE FIFTY MILLILITERS OF WATER THEREFORE IT WEIGHED,FIFTY MEAR UION  NRAEDHN THE FIFTY MA WATE
1880,SATURATED MEANS THAT WE CAN'T DISSOLVE ANY MORE OF THE EPSOM SALT INTO THE H TWO O,MENHSRVE EN O THEETE
1881,I NOTICED THAT WHEN IT'S WHEN THE SOLUTION IS SATURATED THE WATER LEVEL HAS COME ABOVE WHERE IT ORIGINALLY WAS,I NOTHWEN THE ILLUSION IS SAERATEDWATER LEVL HASCMRIIONLY
1882,THE THESE HAVE TO DO WITH UM WHAT WE DID ABOUT SATURATING THE WATER,HEIVSE HA TO D WITHOT WE DID ABOUT SSERATING THE WATER
1883,THIS MEANS THAT THE SALT IN THE SOLUTION WEIGHS SEVENTEEN GRAMS,TH MENIN LUION SEVEN T GRAN
1884,THOSE HAVE TO DO WITH WHAT WE DID WITH SATURATING THE WATER,THE HAFE TO D WITH WOT WE DOD WITH SCERATING THE WATER
1885,I THINK THAT IT IS GYPSUM,I THINK THA  IS JSAN
1886,WE CAN CROSS OUT ALL OF THEM EXCEPT FOR QUARTZ,WE CAN CROUS ALLT THEM EPT OCOURT

2483,IF YOU HAVE A MAGNET RIGHT HERE ON THIS PIECE ON THE BIG PIECE OF PAPER AND A MAGNET RIGHT HERE ON THE THIN PIECE OF PAPER AND A PENCIL RIGHT HERE IT WON'T BE STRONG ENOUGH TO PULL TOWARDS THIS WITH A PENCIL BEHIND IT,BIGAERPAERNPWLL BE STRONGNOF TO LTO
2484,THE FORCE OKAY,
2485,WELL THE NAIL HAS A MAGNETA FIELD AROUND IT SO IF YOU PUT THE MAGNET ON IT AND PUSH IT DOWN IT'S LIKE THE MAGNET WILL STICK TO THE PAPER CLIP ALWAYS,HFIELDRON TANUHDWTICK TO THPAAL
2486,IT'S BASICALLY JUST IT'S BASICALLY THE PAPER CLIP IS ALWAYS GONNA BE MAGNETIZED RATHER WHAT YOU DO IT'S GOING TO BE MAGNETIZED BUT IF YOU HAVE SOMETHING TOO THICK THE MAGNET WON'T STICK TO THE PAPER CLIP,HEAERCLFIS ALA NBTICO THEPAPER
2487,THE NAIL ISN'T FORCING THE PAPER CLIP UP TO IT BECAUSE THE MAGNET'S OFF IT AND ALSO THE FORCE IS OFF IT SO THE MAGNET STILL HAS A FORCE AND ABSERBED IT LIKE IT UP,NTAT A
2488,WELL MOSTLY I'VE BEEN LIKE JUST TRYING TO DISCOVER WHAT ELSE IS MAGNETS BY RUBBING A MAGNET ON SOMETHING THAT'S NOT MAGNETIZED AND IT WORKED,KERYN T EBNMANTN OMTHN OTMATIE
2489,BECAUSE OF THE FORCE IS FORCING IT TO STICK TOGETHER,ECAU TICK TOGATHER
2490,OKAY SO IT'S THE GRAVITY IT'S CALLED A FORCE AND IF IT DOESN'T STICK THAT'S FORCING IT AWAY FROM IT,GALTE C DOS'TNWAY FM
2491,THE NAIL WON'T PICK UP THE PAPER CLIP BECAUSE IT'S NOT MAGNETIZED YET,THK THE PAERBCAS AS NT MATISED YET
2492,THE NAIL ISN'T PICKING UP THE PAPER CLIP BECAUSE THE FORCE IS ALWAYS IN THE MAGNET,THKING  PAERECAS   IS ALA IA
2493,NETISM BASICALLY IS VERY VERY IMPORTANT,AS ONY A E VE VERY IMPOARTE
2494,CAUSE THE NAIL IS GETTING THE MAGNETIC FORCE FROM THE MAGNET SO FOR INSTANCE IF YOU KEPT DOING IT IT WILL MAKE THE PAPER CLIP STICK,AINGA FONGLL MKE THE PAERSTAKE
2495,IT'S CALLED A SHOW FLOW,COFLOW
2496,EVERYTHING WILL DROP BECAUSE MOST OF THE RINGS ARE GETTING STUCK FROM THE MAGNET,ER THING WILL ROW BECSTTHEIN AR  FROMTHE A

2717,WELL,
2718,THE STRAWS TRIED TO H TO HOLD UP THE STRING AND THE POPSICLE STICKS WE NARROWED IT DOWN SO IT WOULD FIT IN TO THOSE LITTLE THINGS THAT HOLD THE RUBBER BAND AND THEIR PROPELLER AND THAT'S HOW IT WORKS,THTYANDTE WE ED DWN TE ZE THINK THER
2719,WELL THE ONE ON THE BOTTOM'S NOT AS STRAIGHT AS THE ONE ON TOP UP AND I THINK THAT IF THE ONE ON THE TOP'S STRAIGHTER IT'LL BE EASIER FOR IT TO FLY BUT AT THE ONE AT AN ANGLE IT MIGHT BE HARDER FOR,BON THNKOTATRBERR
2720,WE USED POPSICLE STICKS AND A PROPELLER AND STRAWS AND THEN WERE WE WERE SPINNING THE PROPELLER TWENTY FIVE TIMES TO SEE IT HOW FAR IT COULD GET DOWN THE STRING,P STCKS IN T PREER IN PENING THE PRPEER TWENTY FIVE TIMETART DOWN THE STRAIN
2721,EFFECTS HOW MUCH IT CAN FLY,A O CNFE

3982,THERE'S A SYRINGE A GRADUATED CYLINDER AND A LITER A LITER LIKE CUP THING,THE AGEWATE TO LNDERN THE LEADERHE LEADERHN
3983,I NOTICED THAT THE LIQUID ISN'T ALL THE WAY TO THE TOP,NOT CA INWAY TO
3984,WHEN WE WORKED WITH THE SODA CAN WE WERE SEEING IF UH THE NUMBER ON THE BOTTLE WAS UM CAMPACITY OR VOLUME,NWE WAKED ITHO NMER NTHE PA VOLUME
3985,I OBSERVED THAT THE CAMPACITY OF THE ORANGE SODA CAN IS THREE HUNDRED THIRTY THREE MILLILITERS,I A SEORVE PA THREE HONDERD THIRTY THREE MELOYORS
3986,I DO NOT KNOW THAT,DUD NOT NO HT
3987,UM A GRADUATED CYLINDER AND PUT WATER IN IT AND THEN DUMP IT INTO THE THE INTO THE SODA CAN,RUEWATED SNERAND PUT WATERN N DMTH OCAN
3988,YOU YOU WOULD ADD FIFTY AND FIFTY AND THAT WOULD GET YOU TO ONE HUNDRED,WHE WAL A FIFTY N FIFTY HNDERD
3989,THE PRINTED NUMBER TELLS YOU HOW MUCH SODA IS IN THE CAN OR WHATEVER LIQUID IS IN THE CAN,THE BER TE  IN AWT ER   INA
3990,THAT IT WOULD HAVE TO BE FULL TO BE VOLUME AND FULL ALL THE WAY TO THE TOP TO BE BE VOLUME AND CAMPACITY,HAT VOLUME WA T THE T VOLUME NAMP
3991,I OBSERVED THAT IT'S AT ITS CAPACITY AND ITS CAPACITY IS THREE HUN THREE HUNDRED THIRTY THREE MILLILITERS,ZPPHETHREE HNDERD THIRTE THREE MELLADOR
3992,IN MATH WE SAW WE TRIED TO SEE IF,MATTH TRY TO S
3993,I'M WELL,WLL
3994,I DO NOT KNOW,I DOUNOT NO
3995,CAMPACITY IS THE IS THE IS THE THIN IS THE AMOUNT OF SOMETHING IN SOMETHING WHEN IT'S FILLED ALL THE WAY TO THE TOP,TCAPATHGA SOMTHING IN SOMTHING AT
3996,SO THAT YOU CAN KNOW YOU GOT THE RIGHT ANSWER,STHOU C
3997,YOU WOULD USE A SYRINGE OR A GRADUATED CYLINDER AND WITH THE SYRINGE YOU WOULD PULL THE LIQUID OUT AND WITH THE GRADUATED CYLINDER YOU WOULD POUR THE STUFF IN IT AND YEAH,ATED ER THEOUT AN  EWATED SERSTF
3998,I OBSERVED THAT THE THREE HUNDRED MILLILITERS IS THE VOLUME OF THE LIQUID AND THREE HUNDRED THIRTY THREE IS THE CAMPACITY OF THE LIQUID,THRE HNERD MLEADERI A VOLUME  N THREE ONER THERT THREE
3999,I OBSERVED THAT THE TALL CONTAINER HOLDS TWO HUNDRED MILLILITERS OF WATER,ZRVCAE HOLDES TWO HONDERD MELLOEAOES  WATER
4000,TH I DON'T KNOW,
4001,YOU COULD LOOK AT THE CONTAINER AND SEE HOW BIG IT IS AND THEN LOOK AT THE SYRINGE AND SEE HOW BIG IT IS AND THEN THINK HOW MANY OF THE SYRINGES WILL GO IN TO IT,PANERNLKE
4002,WE FIGURED OUT THE VOLUME BY USING A SYRINGE AND UM A GRADUATED CYLINDER O,WE FIERED E VOLUME B YUINGSRAEWATED ER
4003,YOU CAN YOU HA CAN FIND AN OBJECT THAT YOU KNOW HOW MUCH WATER IT HOLDS AND THEN USE THAT TO MEASURE THE VOLUME OF SOMETHING,IND NOB HA MUCH WATEROINTMASERD THE VOLUME S
4004,YOU MEASURE SOMETHING THINGS THAT ARE SMALLER THAN A LITER S B YEAH,MRD S TIN  SMOAR IN T LEADER
4005,THAT OBJECT IS A SYRINGE AND IT HAS FORTY MILLILITERS OF WATER,THATOBJCT ISSEN  AFR MLADERSATTER
4006,I REALIZED THAT THE CUP WAS FILLED WITH ONE HUNDRED FORTY TWO MILLILITERS,REALLISED THT THE  WAS FILLD WITH ONE HNDERD FR TO
4007,SYRINGE WE USED UM COULD GO UP TO YOU COULD GET IT UP TO FIFTY AND THEN IT WOULD STOP SO YEAH,T UP T FIFTYN HE
4008,IT'S WHEN YOU IT CAN'T HOLD ANYMORE WATER,II N'T HOLD ANE MER WATER
4009,THEY'RE ALL TWO HUNDRED MILLILITER VESSELS,H  TWO HNDERD M LEADER VESLES
4010,VOLUME IS UM THE STUFF VOLUME IS WHAT IS INSIDE OF A UM OF A UM OF A CONTAINER OR SOMETHING,VOLUME IH VOLUME T  INSIG COMPATER SOM THNG
4011,I NOTICE THAT IT HAS ONE HUNDRED MILLILITERS IT CAN HOLD ONE HUNDRED MILLILITERS,NOTHI HAS ON HONDERDLEVEADORIT CAN HOLD WN HONDERD EVADERS
4012,CAPACITY IS UM AMOUNT IT CAN HOLD WHEN IT'S TO THE TIPPY TIP TOP LIKE YEAH,PATYAMNT CAN HOLD N TO THE TMPTO
4013,IT'S GOING WELL THANK YOU,NGWLL
4014,I DISCOVERED THAT DIFFERENT CONTAINERS HOLD DIFFERENT UM AMOUNT AND IF YOU HAVE A BIGGER CONTAINER YOU HAVE A BIGGER ANSWER AND YOU HAVE IF YOU HAVE A SMALLER CONTAINER YOU HAVE A SMALLER ANSWER,TTNAIRE A BIGERNOLLROLLE
4015,YESTERDAY WE SAW HOW MUCH A PLASTIC CUP HOW MANY UM HOW MANY MILLILITERS A PLASTIC CUP HAD UM LIKE WE USED YEAH,YUSTRAYWMHYE MEO LEADORSEI
4016,I NOTICED THAT UM AT THE CUP'S CAPACITY IT HAD ONE HUNDRED FORTY TWO MILLILITERS IN IT,NOTTPE HD FOURTY TWO MI LEADEORS
4017,I DO NOT KNOW,DOU NOT NO
4018,I DON'T KNOW,
4019,THAT TOOL IS A GRADUATED CYLINDER,THT I A GRDEUWATED SIELLNDER
4020,I LEARNED THAT IT DOESN'T REALLY MATTER WHAT SHAPE IT IS IF IT HOLDS THE SAME AMOUNT OF WATER,I LRN TH OUSN'T RALLY MAER WTOLD THE SAME AMONTOF WATER
4021,YOU WOULD MEASURE THINGS THAT ARE SMALLER THAN A LITER AND THAT ARE BIGGER THAN ONE MILLILITER,W M THINKS THOR IN LEADER N IN  MELEADER
4022,WHEN YOU HAVE AN EMPTY CUP YOU CAN USE IT FOR UM PUTTING IN IN THE BALANCE OR BASICALLY ANYTHING,YO HAVE A MYUTINGINTHE BN
4023,IT MAKES THEM GOOD CAUSE YOU CAN SUCK UP A PREC VERY PRECISE AMOUNT OF WATER,MASME COES YOU C PSI AMTF WATER
4024,YOU CAN USE A VIAL,YOU CAN EASE  VL
4025,THESE TOOLS ARE USEFUL BECAUSE YOU CAN GO FROM SO YOU CAN I DON'T REALLY KNOW,THEASE TALES ARE BC YOU C GO FRRELY O
4026,UM THEY I DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY REPRESENT,EDON'T NO WOT  REPRESENT
4027,IT'S A LITER,PLR
4028,GOOD,D
4029,IT WOULD TELL YOU HOW BIG OR SMALL THE CUP IS,L YOU H BIG
4030,I NOTICED THAT THE FIRST VIAL IS MUCH BIGGER THAN THE SECOND VIAL,NOTH E S MUCH BIGER THN THE SNFIR
4031,A LITER CAN BE BROKEN DOWN INTO MILLILITERS,LEADER CAN BE BRON DOWN IN T MLEADORS
4032,UM WE USED UM VIALS B AND I DON'T REALLY KNOW,W  IS BN'T REALLY NO
4033,YOU WOULD UM THERE'S NUMBERS ON THE SIDE AND YOU WOULD SEE HOW MANY MMM UM SOME I DON'T KNOW,TE NOMBER  ON ASIDE AND YE WILD SE MONY'O
4034,THE PLASTIC CUP,THPAU
4035,I NOTICED THAT BOTH OF THE CUPS HAVE UM MMM ONE HUNDRED MILLILITERS ON THEM,NOT TH BTN HNDERD M LEADERAN
4036,YOU WOULDN'T GET A VERY GOOD AN ANSWER BECAUSE THEY'RE DIFFERENT SIZE AND IT'S NOT A VERY GOOD WAY TO MEASURE LIQUID,LDN'TVERYGOODB RENSSNOA VY GOOD WA TA
4037,YOU WOULD FILL THE CUP WITH WATER AND THEN YOU WOULD TA YOU TAKE A,YO WIL SILL A CORP WITH WATER INOA
4038,I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE METRIC UNITS ARE FOR MEASURING VOLUME,I DON'T THAR FROM ARINGVOLUME
4039,IT'S A SYRINGE WITH UM WATER IN IT,IT N SIAR WITH  WATERNA
4040,I DO NOT KNOW THAT,DNOT M
4041,TEN OF THEM MAKE UP A LITER,NH MK THE LEADER
4042,ERE ARE ONE THOUSAND ONE THOUSAND MILLILITERS IN A LITER,N HOSAND LEADERS IN A LEADER
4043,THERE ARE ONE THOUSAND MILLILITERS IN A LITER,R  THOUSAND MLEADEORS IN  LEADER
4044,S TELLING ME THAT YOU MILLILITERS ARE LESS THAN A LITER,TELLING M THM LADOR S T LEADER
4045,I FORGET,IGET
4046,MILLILITERS ARE LESS THAN A LITER SO THAT YOU CAN UM MEASURE THE VOLUME OF SOMETHING LESS THAN A LITER,TH LEADEOR TH LEADERER TH VOLUME O SOMTHIN LES THN LEADER
4047,YOU WOULD NEED TO UM WEIGH THEM AND LIKE WEIGH THEM AND THEN PUT THEM ON ON AND THEN PUT THEM IN ORDER FROM HEAVIEST TO LIGHTEST,MNPUT THEM N OETATE
4048,IT'S THAT THE LIKE GRAY LINE A ADDS UP WITH THE LIKE ELEVATED BLUE SPACE,SH  AWTH TH ELEVATED BEAE
4049,THAT PICTURE IS OF A LITTLE IS OF A CUBE THAT IS ONE GRAM,TH PICTUR  E GRAUND
4050,I FORGET AND I DON'T KNOW,ON'T N
4051,THE THEY'RE THE THEY PUT THE UM METAL CHIP IN ONE SIDE OF THE UM SCALE AND THEN THEY'RE PUTTING GRAMS IN TO SEE HOW MUCH IT WEIGHS,THEY PUT H METDIL SCHIP IN ONSTHEPUTING GRANM T SE HOU MUCHAE
4052,BECAUSE THEN YOU'LL GET A MUCH MORE ACCURATE ANSWER THAN WITH YOUR HANDS,BECAUSE THEY WILL GET CH MRAER THN WITH YOUR HANDS
4053,YOU COULD DO IT BY IF YOU IF YOU WERE JUST ESTIMATING YOU COULD LIKE I WHAT I WROTE IS I THOUGHT THE HEAVIEST WAS THE UM METAL AND THEN THE PLASTIC AND THEN THE WOOD,MATINGROUTED
4054,IT'S THAT UM THE MATERIALS WEIGH MORE AND THAT WHEN SOME MATERIALS WEIGH MORE THAN OTHER MATERIALS,HMTUL AOMATLEAM THN THER MTALES
4055,UM YOU ARE USING A SCALE TO MEASURE TO MEASURE THE WEIGHT OF THE PLASTIC DISK,OAE YOUSING  SCALLE TOASER TO ASERETHE
4056,THE UM,S
4057,YOU WOULD MEASURE THE WEIGHTS OF THINGS,WIL MER TIESOF THINS
4058,I DON'T KNOW,DO'T
4059,YOU WOULD NEED TO,
4060,I FOR I DON'T KNOW,ION'T NO
4061,WE USED PAPER CLIPS,WILL OUS PAPER EATS
4062,IT WOULD AFFECT BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW,BECAIN'T NO
4063,UM IT WAS ONE GRAM,IT WAS OYGRAD
4064,I DON'T KNOW,DON'TNO
4065,IT WAS EIGHT GRAMS THE LITTLE THE METAL DISK WAS EIGHT GRAMS,IT WASAME  AS GRAN
4066,I DO NOT KNOW,DNOT
4067,UM GRAMS ARE UM WHAT LIKE THE METRIC SY GRAMS ARE THE METRIC SYSTEM ARE IN THE METRIC SYSTEM,GANRANDAT ICSTAM
4068,THEN WE USED GRAMS TO ACTU TO FIGURE OUT THE REAL ANSWER,NAM FIEO THE RELL ANCR
4069,THE WEIGHT AND THE MASS IS THAT IT IS EIGHT GRAMS,IGREANS
4070,IT'S NOT A GOOD TECHNIQUE BECAUSE UM MISS OUR TEACHER GAVE US TWO DIFFERENT KINDS OF PAPER CLIPS SO WE ALL WE GOT DIFFERENT ANSWERS,CH BC TETER DRNTCINAERE DNT ANS
4071,PAPER CLIPS,APERLATS
4072,I THINK IT'S THE MATERIAL THAT MAKES THEM DIFFERENT AMOUNTS,I THINK TS T MIURLMAKES O DERNT A
4073,YOU UH I DON'T KNOW I THINK,DN'T M
4074,IT MEANS THAT IT IS EIGHT GRAMS,NSTARTED  GRAN
4075,I DISCOVERED THAT OUR PAPER CLIPS WEIGHED ONE GRAM,E TASW GRAM
4076,I FORGET,IGET
4077,ON C THE TEMPERATURE IS TWENTY DEGREES,ON S THE TEMPTATUR IS TWENTY D GREES
4078,IT WORKS BETTER BECAUSE THEN YOU GET THE ACCURATE THE CORRECT ANSWER AND YEAH,THT  BATTER BECASE TH Y T AR
4079,YOU USE A THERMOMETER TO MEASURE THE TEMPERATURE OF SOMETHING,HL U O MASERE THE TEMPTATURO SONG
4080,I DO NOT KNOW,I DNOT NO
4081,IT MEASURES,OTHING
4082,UM THERE IS NO MORE I CAN SAY,TH IS NOMOR CSAVE
4083,I DO NOT KNOW THAT,NT NO
4084,I THINK HE IS TRYING TO FIGURE OUT W UM WHICH ONE IS HOTTEST WHICH ONE IS COLDEST AND WHICH ONE IS IN BETWEEN,I THINK IS TYNG T IS AS CBETWEEN
4085,YESTERDAY WE USED OUR FINGERS TO SEE UM IF CUP A CUP B OR CUP C'S W WATER WAS WARMER,YUSTAY W UTARTE FGERS TOWATERARM
4086,SO THAT EVERYBODY CAN KNOW LIKE HAVE A STANDARD THING FOR LIKE ROOM TEMPERATURE AND LIKE WHEN YOU DON'T GO OUTSIDE AND STUFF LIKE THAT,A SAERIG  EMPTW DN'T GO DEN STF LIKE THAT
4087,WE ESTIMATED WITH OUR FINGER,MATD WITH HOUR FNGER
4088,YOU CAN SENSE THE DIFFERENT TEMPERATURES OF THE WATER,YOU CAN SENT THE DRNT TEMPTATUR  TH WATER
4089,UM I DO NOT KNOW,R D NOT NOW
4090,GOOD,
4091,I DO NOT KNOW THAT,NOT
4092,IT TELLS YOU THAT IT'S MUCH MUCH COLDER,ELLS YOUTHA IMCH MCHCALDAR
4093,WE USED A THERMOMETER TO SEE THE TEMPERATURE IN THE WATER,WI ED D TOE THE TEMPATUR IN THE WATER
4094,I THINK ABOUT IS IT HOT COLD OR JUST WARM,I THINK AB IS  H CLDAR JUST WARM
4095,SO THAT YOU CAN ALL KNOW THE EXACT TEMPERATURE OF THE WATER AND NOBODY WILL GET CONFUSED IN BETWEEN WHICH ONE IS WARMER AND WHICH ONE IS COLDER,THT YOU CAN TH ZA TEMPATER OF THE WATERNO WILL GET CONFUSIN BETWEENHAH CALDER
4096,WE WERE SEEING HA WHICH CUP WAS WARMER AND WE FIGURED OUT THAT THE B CUP WAS THE COLDEST BUT A AND C WERE THE SAME TEMPERATURE,THIHCO W WARMENBASDE  THE SAME TEMPTER
4097,IT'S WHEN IT'S HOT WHEN IT GOES UP AND IT'S COLD WHEN IT'S GO DOW WHEN IT GOES DOWN,HN GOS P A COLD WHEN O DWEN GOS DOWN
4098,YOU U WE'RE USING CELSIUS IN THIS UNIT,INGEIIN
4099,UM WE WE I FOUND OUT THAT THE IT WENT IN BETWEEN FIFTY AND TEN WHICH IS THIRTY AND YEAH,N BETWEEN FIFTY NENIH IS THIRTY N
4100,WE'RE MIXING THE ICE AND THE CO AND THE HOT WATER TOGETHER AND WE'RE GONNA GET A NEW TEMPERATURE OF WATER,MING THE ICHE HCOD HT WATER TOATHERNET A N WATER
4101,WE PUT A THERMOMETER IN,TPUT  SO
4102,YOU USE GRAMS,GRANS
4103,I FOUND OUT THAT THE DRY SPONGE WAS THREE GRAMS AND THAT BUT THAT IT WAS THREE GRAMS,I ONTTH IOONAERAN
4104,I FORGET AND I DON'T KNOW,TI
4105,A SOAKED SPONGE UM I DON'T KNOW,DN'T NO
4106,I KNOW THAT IF YOU UM PUT A DRY SPONGE IN WATER THAT IT WILL LIKE Z ABSORB AND GET MUCH BIGGER,I NOE TH AN PT RPS IN WATERBZRE AN GET MCH IGER
4107,UM THE S I OBSERVED THAT THE SPONGE THE DRY SPONGE SOAKED UP UM THIRTEEN GRAMS OF WATER,THEITHRAM WATER
4108,UM I DON'T REALLY KNOW ANYMORE,DON'T REALLY NO ETEY MO
4109,THE SPONGE IN THE MIDDLE IS WET AND IT DOESN'T HAVE AS MUCH WATER IN IT AS THE SOAKED SPONGE,M DOESN'T HAVE  MUCH WATERN
4110,I NOTICED THAT THE DRY SPONGE EQUALS THREE GRAMS,I NOHREGRAN
4111,YOU UM WHEN YOU DON'T YOU WOULD COUNT YOU COUNT THE GRAMS AND THE CUP WITHOUT THE SPONGE IN IT,NN THE C WITHTP
4112,I NOTICED THAT UM THAT THEY WERE BALANCED AND THE WHITE THING WAS IN LINE WITH THE BLUE UM LINE,NOT VNS IN  AS IN IN WITH THE BLUEIN
4113,YOU CAN SEE HOW MUCH WATER THE SPONGE SOAKED UP BY UM DOING THE ANSWER YOU GOT MINUS THE WEIGHT OF THE DRY SPONGE,YOU CAN SEE HOH WATER HEUING THE ANTER YA OFTRON
4114,IT'S GOING GOOD THANK YOU,
4115,WE WERE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW MUCH THEY WEIGHED,WER TRYN TO IHOU MUCH THEY WA
4116,SO THESE OBJECTS THERE'S A DRY SPONGE A WET S SPONGE AND A SOAKED SPONGE AND THE DRY SPONGE IS THE LIGHTEST THEN THE WET SPONGE THEN THE SOAKED SPONGE IS THE HEAVIEST,HS A ONINTHATON
4117,UM A WET SPONGE IS UM SOFT IS SQUISHIER AND UM IT FEELS SOFTER AND YEAH,ON SOFTARF SOFTER AN
4118,WHEN YOU HAVE A BALANCE AND A SPONGE YOU CAN UM PUT THE SPONGE IN ONE SIDE AND PUT GRAM PIECES ON THE OTHER SIDE TO SEE HOW MUCH IT WEIGHS,WHEYOU HAVE A B INAONTPNSRAPA ONH OTHERSIDE TOS
4119,I FOUND OUT THAT THE DRY SPONGE WHEN IT WHEN IT'S SOAKED ABSORBED LIKE UM LIKE TEN TIMES ITS OWN WEIGHT,N'TTPONNNT NTMEA
4120,IT'S WHEN IT STOPS ABSORBING WATER,STAP A BSZAREN WATER
4121,YOU CAN USE A BALANCE TO MEASURE THE WEIGHT AND THE MASS OF SOMETHING,CAN E  BNS TOAHT IN THE MAH SOMTHN
4122,I FIGURED OUT THAT THE WET SPONGE WAS SIXTEEN GRAMS,I NEREDO W SIX TE GRAND
4123,I DO NOT KNOW,DOUNOT NO

4125,T,
4126,YOU WOULD NEED TO THINK ABOUT HOW LONG IS YOUR HAND OR YOUR FINGER AND THEN YOU CAN MEASURE IT,THINK ABOUTHA LONG IS UR HARH
4127,YOU WOULD USE CENTIMETERS,WILLD YOUS SINOMATR
4128,IT TELLS YOU THAT IT'S ONE CENTIMETER WIDE,A MEADER
4129,YOU USE MILLIMETERS WHEN SOMETHING IS SMALLER THAN A CENTIMETER,MATR NOLERAAER
4130,AND GENERALLY USUALLY UM TWO THINGS ARE LIKE THE SAME HEIGHTH,ROLO THINGS A LIKE THE SAME
4131,THAT THE BIGGEST LIKE THING WITH CENTIMETERS ON IT IS A METER THEN IT GOES TO THE DECAMETER THEN A CENTIMETER THEN A ME MILLIMETER,HAAECMATRIN A NMATA

4252,UM SO WHAT WE DID FIRST WAS WE GOT LIKE EVERYTHING WE NEED AND LIKE THE BALANCE AND THE MASS PIECES UM MASS PIECES,FARY TING T LIKE TE B
4253,GRAMS EIGHTY THREE GRAMS,GR
4254,UM IT'S ABOUT H HOW MUCH YOU THINK IT IS THE CLOSEST YOU THINK IT WILL BE,ABOUT HO MUCH O  THINK IS LOTHE YOUTHINT WIL
4255,YES BEFORE WE ME UM ESTIMATED THE WEIGHT OF THE SPONGE UM THE DRY SPONGE WE ESTIMATED,AMATED THER NTAMATED
4256,YEAH WE KNEW THAT THE SPON THE DRY SPONGE WAS TWO GRAMS SO WE MINUS TWO GRAMS FROM EIGHTY FIVE AND WE GOT EIGHTY THREE,AMS MON TOAMS FROM ITIVEIHTTHREE
4257,OH I DON'T REALLY REMEMBER,
4258,WELL WE KNEW IT I KNOW IT'S NOT A KILOMETER CAUSE THAT'S IN ME LIKE UM,NO MMATERC
4259,YEAH GRAM GRAM PIECE LIKE,SAMOSLY
4260,YUP,
4261,UM WELL WE OUR TEACHER UM DID THAT BUT I THINK IT'S STILL DRYING OUT THINK SO,WILL WEAR TETB THNKI SRYO
4262,WE DID UM WEIGHING HOW MUCH SPONGE CA E UM WATER CAN TAKE UP,WE ING HO MUCHU WATER
4263,DRY SPONGE,RICA
4264,UM A KILOGRAM,OAS
4265,GOOD,
4266,UM SOMETIMES BUT USUALLY NOT REALLY,SOMTIMES YULY NOT RLY
4267,UM I HAVEN'T LEARNED THAT YET HMM I THINK THAT WAS IT,VEEN'T AR T YETTNGS

4271,THE MORE I'M GUESSING THE MORE WATER IT HAS THE BIGGER IT IS,THENNWATER
4272,I DON'T KNOW,
4273,UM IT WAS SQUISHY WE DIDN'T REALLY FEEL IT THOUGH YEAH I DIDN'T REALLY FEEL,DN'T RLE FE
4274,UM WELL WHEN PUT IT IN THE WATER WE SAW IT LIKE A GIANT BUT WHEN YOU TOOK IT OUT IT WAS SMALLER,WHEN WE PUTT IN THE WATER WE OA
4275,YEAH,
4276,WHAT,
4277,I HAVEN'T DONE THAT I DON'T KNOW YET,I
4278,UM IT'S KEEPING ALL THE WATER IN THERE UNTIL YOU CAN SQUEEZE IT OUT,EAPING HWATER INTE YOU C
4279,WHAT,
4280,SO THAT IN CASE YOU ACCIDENTALLY DROPPED IT YOU IT WOULDN'T BE GOOD M EXPLOSION,SHCAEC PLOSION
4281,BYE,
4282,UM STAN A STANDARD UNIT WHEN YOU USE LIQUIDS WOULD BE WATER OR LIKE THE KINDA LIQUID THAT YOU'RE USING,ATA WENWAT
4283,THE VILE,L
4284,YEAH LIKE YOU COULD LIKE UM USE LIKE TAKE THE SMALLER AND PUT IT SOMEWHERE ELSE AND LIKE TAKE TURNS USING IT,TK T
4285,I THINK THIS ONE IS,
4286,LIKE POUR IT AND THEN SEE HOW MANY MILLILITERS IT IS,TEN
4287,WELL BECAUSE IT'S HIGHER AND IT KINDA LOOKS LIKE LIKE IT WAS THEN AND IT LIKE IT LOOKS LIKE THEN AND LIKE LOOKS THE SAME,BECAI HIGHER N IL  A
4288,OF SOMETHING IT'S LIKE A K LIKE A THINK LIKE THAT LOOKS LIKE KINDA LIKE THIS,NES
4289,WELL,
4290,AND THIS THESE TWO THINGS,THNK
4291,WELL YOU LOOK AT IT AND LIKE GO LIKE THIS WITH YOUR HANDS AND THEN LIKE,I YOUAOU
4292,GUESS WHAT UM ESTIMATING WOULD BE,TMATING
4293,NO,
4294,ESTIMATES ARE BASICALLY ABOUT GUESSING,
4295,UH WELL YOU COULD DO THE CUP AND LIKE COULD HAVE,YOU CANTH
4296,I KNOW,
4297,BECAUSE IF YOU DON'T WANT THE SAME ONE YOU'RE NOT ACCURATE,BN'T AM
4298,UH NO WE DIDN'T IT WAS NOT UM WE DIDN'T DO IT WITH F WE DIDN'T IT WASN'T FULL WE JUST POURED WATER AND WAS LIKE EMPTY,ANLUWATER
4299,UM WE FI WE FIGURED OUT WE WENT LIKE THIS AND THIS AND THEN WE DID ALL OF IT WELL WE WENT TO A AND THEN CLASS B LIKE WENT LIKE WE WOULD TAKE THE THING AND POUR IN MORE AND MORE,WTT T TA SAMGIN
4300,WELL UH WELL MILLILITERS ARE UM A LITER IS I THINK A THOUSAND MILLILITERS AND MILLILITERS ARE LI LIKE A DROP,ADERTH LEAD THINK A HAN EADORANDEA
4301,UM YOU COULD USE UM THIS,ME UC
4302,UM I DON'T KNOW,O
4303,UM WELL WE FIGURED OUT THAT IT WE THAT THE SODA COMPANY THE UM PEOPLE WHO MADE THESE W W LEFT A LITTLE SPACE BECAUSE UM BECAUSE UH,NWIL  IOTYHPEOPLE BCBECASE
4304,I THINK GRADUATED CYLINDER,E  NDER
4305,WELL THEN YOU KNOW THAT IT'S WELL THEN IF YOU POUR AND IT GETS ALL THE WAY UP THERE AND THEN YOU STILL HAVE EXTRA YOU COULD POUR IT INTO A ONE LITER BEAKER AND THEN POUR THE REST INTO HERE,T THE LU TA
4306,UM ES MEASURE STUFF SMALLER THAN A LITER,MLERED HN THE LEADER
4307,YEAH,
4308,YOU COULD LIKE,
4309,WELL LIKE FOR THE ONE THE GRADUATED CYLINDER MEASURE THE VOLUME YOU COULD LIKE POUR LIKE THIS CUP INTO THERE AND SEE HOW MUCH IT IS,EATED NDERVMA IN SI
4310,UM YOU WOULD PROBABLY THINK TWICE OF HOW MUCH IT WOULD BE,OURA THINK TWICE HO MUH
4311,UM THAT THEY WERE LIKE WE WEREN'T ACCURATE AND WE WEREN'T USING A GOOD AMOUNT,AA ODIMT
4312,WATER MILLILITERS LITERS UM,LEADRA SNG
4313,YEAH AND THEN LIKE SEE IF IT GOES LIKE TO THE FIFTY OR UM TWENTY LINE AND THEN YOU WOULD KNOW THAT IT HAD LIKE A HUNDRED AND TWENTY,LIK THEFIFT ENY IN THE NEWDRD N TWENTY
4314,HELLO,S
4315,ESTIMATE,
4316,HI H HI BYE,AM
4317,WELL YOU COULD YOU LIKE POLE THAT'S KINDA LIKE THIS AND,A
4318,UM IT WAS K UM METERS,AMATO
4319,THANK YOU,NKEE
4320,IT'S ALL ABOUT ONE GRAM ONE GRAM EQUALS JUST ABOUT ONE T P TINY PARTICLE OF EACH TW THING WE HAVE HERE,EOUT A JUSTOK TINY ARTACLETHINKWE AR
4321,WE MEASURED THEM AND FIND OUT HOW HEAVY THEY WERE AND IT WAS PRETTY COOL,E MEASERED THEM AN FIND ACLE
4322,THE THINGS ARE BEING PUT INSIDE THE BASK INT THE THINGS ARE BEING PUT INSIDE THE SCALE,BING PUT INSIDE TH THNG BING PT INSIDE TH SCAL
4323,WE COULD PUT IT ON A SCALE,CDON TH SKALL
4324,THE ONE ON THE RIGHT IS HEAVIER,OE  THE RA IS HEAVYER
4325,TO FIND OUT HOW HEAVY THE METAL DISC IS,O FINDHO H E
4326,I COULD USE THEM TO PUT THE THINGS ON THE SCALE AND SEE HOW MUCH THEY WEIGH,PUT  THINGS ON TH SCALL
4327,GOOD,GO
4328,WE'VE BEEN PRACTICING MEASUREMENT,E O PN PR MASERMENT
4329,TO SEE WHAT MATERIAL THEY'RE MADE OF AND THEN WE'D BE ABLE TO FIND OUT HOW HEAVY THEY WOULD BE,TO SE T MATURLEWBE ABL T FINDO
4330,THEIR MASS IS HEAVIER SO THEY WEIGH MORE,SMA AVR
4331,Y WE'RE TRYING TO SEE HOW MANY PAPER CLIPS WILL FIT INTO EACH CUP INTO THE CUPS TO MAKE IT EQUAL TO THE PLASTIC CHIP,TRYN TO SE HOUMY PAPR CLITS W FTIHCOMAK  ECLETOHLTER
4332,PAPER CLIP IS NOT EQUAL TO ONE GRAM ONE GRAM IS A LOT LIGHTER THAN A LARGE PAPER CLIP BECAUSE A PAPER CLIP ET WEIGH A LARGE PAPER CLIP WEIGHS MORE THAN ONE GRAM,OT EETNGAND ISLATER THN A PERPHA

4334,A SCALE,SCALL
4335,TO SEE HOW MUCH THEY BOTH WEIGH,SEHOUMHWA
4336,WEIGHING THE PLASTIC DISC WAS ALL ABOUT ABOUT SEEING HOW MANY GRAMS IT WAS AND WHA AND HOW MU HOW HEAVY IT WOULD EQUAL,AYING PLATIC TIS I ALLBOTING HO MONY GRAND IT WASLE
4337,THE WEIGHT IS HEAVIER AND SO IT IS JUST A LOT EASIER TO USE,THEAS HAIERIN SORSER T
4338,IT WILL HELP YOU KNOW THE EXACT SI THE EXACT WAY ABOUT IT AND IT'S VERY IMPORTANT,WIL HELPUASAY ABOUTT VER IMPOARTNT
4339,IS FIGURING OUT HOW HEAVY IT IS TO MAKE SURE THEY ARE CORRECT,I ING  MAURRCT
4340,THEY ALL ARE MADE OF DIFFERENT ME MATERIALS SO THEY MAKE DIFFERENT SO THEY WEIGH DIFFERENT THINGS,TTHAARMAHOF MTIL SOHK ANT THINKS
4341,YES,ET
4342,METAL IS HEAVIER THAN PLASTIC AND WOOD SO THAT MAKES IT HEAVIER,METS HAARTH PLHAVYEAR
4343,I PUT THE THINGS IN THE BUCKETS TO SEE HOW HEAVY THEY WERE,UT THINGS N THE BOS TO HR
4344,USE A SCALE,SCAE
4345,SEE THERE'S EIGHT GRAMS IN THIS CUP SO THE CUP IS THIS METAL DISC IS EQUAL TO EIGHT GRAMS THAT'S HOW YOU CAN FIGURE IT OUT,ER EGRAMS IN TH MET JUST VEIOYOU C FIER
4346,IT'S IMPORTANT TO GET THE ACCURATE MEASUREMENTS UNLESS Y IF YOU WANT TO GET IF YOU WANT TO KNOW HOW E MUCH SOMETHING WEIGHS N TO GET IF YOU'RE GOING TO BUY SOMETHING,NPTAHRMNL MCHORBSOMN
4347,I THINK THIS IS HAPPENING BECAUSE IT IS REPRESENTING THE ELECTRICITY,I THINK THIS IS HPNI BECAUS IS REPRESENING THE LECT
4348,IT IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE IF IF ONE LIGHT BULB DIES THEN THE OTHER STAYS,IIS NPARTNTBCAUSO IE IN THE OTHER STATE
4349,NO IT IS NOT DIFFERENT,DES NOT
4350,THE PATHWAYS DON'T ONLY GO THROUGH THE METAL PART OF THE LIGHT BULB BUT THEY ALSO GO THROUGH THE FUSE OF THE LIGHT BULB,THPATHAY'TL GO THO THE MEDOPART O THE B THOVF
4351,A SERIES CIRCUIT IS AN ELECTRICAL CIRCUIT WITH ONLY ONE PATHWAY A PARALLEL CIRCUIT IS AN ELECTRICAL CIRCUIT WITH TWO MORE THAN ONE PATHWAY,A R CIRUALCIRUT WITH ONLY NEPATHAL IRULIUH HN NPATHAY
4352,THAT IS REPRESENTING THE ELECTRICITY FLOWING THROUGH THE LIGHT BULBS,THAREPRESENTIN TH LECOOY FOING THRO THE LIBOS
4353,THEY ARE DIFFERENT FROM SERIES CIRCUITS BECAUSE THEY WOULD HAVE MORE THAN ONE PATHWAY AND SERIES CIRCUITS ONLY HAVE ONE PATHWAY,THMIRCUS  HA AR PATHWY IN CIRCPATH
4354,YES I DID,MUED
4355,WE'VE BEEN LEARING ABOUT SERIES AND PARALLEL CIRCUITS,WE'VE BEN LARING ABOUT CERS IN PARL CIRCUS
4356,THE ELECTRICITY IS FLOWING FROM THE BATTERY TO ONE LIGHT BULB AND THROUGH THAT LIGHT BULB IT IS IT IS FLOWING THROUGH MORE WIRES TO ANOTHER LIGHT BULB,THE LCOE S FLOWING FROMTHEAEN THO THA S FLOWING THRO URWATEROHER
4357,GOOD,GOOD
4358,THEY FLOW THROUGH THE R THEY FLOW THROUGH THE METAL AND THE LIGHT BULB HOLDERS,THEY FLOW  FLOW THO MEONTHEIBE HOALDERS
4359,IT IS A PARALLEL CIRCUIT BECAUSE THERE ARE TWO PATHWAYS,A PAIL CIRCUT BECAUS THIRAR TWO PATHWAES
4360,THERE ARE TWO PATHWAYS FROM THE LI FROM THE BATTERY THAT ARE GOING TO THE TWO DIFFERENT LIGHT BULBS,THEAR TO PATH FROMFROMTHE BATTER GING TO TH TWO DRNT IBS
4361,I DISCOVERED THAT THE ELECTRICITY IS FLOWING THROUGH THE METAL ON THE LIGHT BULB HOLDERS,DESUVERTHTHLECTOOTY IS FLOING THRO TH MEO NILDRS
4362,BY PATHWAYS I MEAN THE ELECTRICITY FLOWING THROUGH THE WIRES,BY PATHFETE IMENLCTO FLOWING THRO THE WAIER
4363,THIS IS A SERIES CIRCUIT,THIS IS A IRIUS CIRCUT
4364,WE HAVE BEEN SEEING WHAT WILL WHAT KIND OF METAL WILL STICK TO MAGNETS,WE CINDOF METOL WI STICKTO MAONT
4365,MAGNETS WILL JUST STICK TO ANYTHING THAT IS IRON OR STEEL,MAGLL JUST C TNGTHIN RT
4366,I MEAN LIKE UM THE MAGNET IS ATTRACTING THE PAPER CLIP,I MEN THE MANT IS A TRACT IN THE PAPERCATE
4367,YES I DID,DADSARTED
4368,WE FOUND OUT THAT IRON AND STEEL STICK TO MAGNETS,WE OUNH IRN STEAD STIC TMA
4369,THEN THE MAGNETISM WOULD NOT GO THROUGH TO THE OTHER MAGNET FROM ONE,THMANTESO WALD GO THREW TO THE OTHER MAONT
4370,WE HAVE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT UM ELECTRICITY AND MAGNETISM,WE HAVEN LERING ABOTLCTCTY IN MAGNTISAM
4371,THE THING THAT SURPRISED ME THE MOST WAS MAGNETISM TRAVELLING THROUGH THE IRON OR STEEL OBJECT SO IT COULD PICK UP MORE OF THOSE THINGS,ING SPRISED ME THE MOSTMTSM  THR RN OAN PIC UP
4372,THE TWO MAGNETS ARE STICKING TO EACH OTHER AND IF YOU'VE ONE MAGNET AROUND THEN THE OTHER ONE WILL FOLLOW IT,THE TWO MANT STICKING TO TATHERAND EHTHERBFL
4373,GOOD,GOOD
4374,UM THE THE MAGNET IS PULLING THE PAPER CLIP THROUGH THE PAPER BUT IF IT'S TOO THICK IT WON'T WORK,A  PLING THPER THRO THEPAERI TOHI
4375,THEY ARE ATTR THEY'RE ATTRACTING AND AND IF IF YOU MOVE IT AROUND THEN THEY WILL STILL BE STICKING TOGETHER,TH TRACTAMOVEDROUTHEHE WIL STILL BE STICKING TOGATHER
4376,I MEAN TURN AROUND LIKE IT'S FACING THE OPPOSITE WAY THAT IT SHOULD BE,E TURNDROUNDASING THE OPSOT WAY SU
4377,I MEAN LIKE UM BREAK THE FORCE OF ATTRACTION,I MEAN EGHHORSE OF ATRACTION
4378,WE LEARNED THAT THE THE BIGGER NUMBER OF SPACERS THE LESS WASHERS IT WOULD TAKE TO BREAK THE FORCE OF ATTRACTION,WE N IGER NMBER OA  ATFORO ATRACTION
4379,THE MAGNET IS S STUCK TO NAIL AND AND THE MAGNETISM IS TRAVELLING THROUGH THE NAIL SO THE NAIL WOULD STICK TO THE PAPER CLIP AND IT'S CALLED THE TEMPORARY MAGNET,TH MANATHMATSON AS TILING THRO THE NATH A STICKPAERCFIN A C TEMPERMANT
4380,IT WON'T STICK TO ALUMINUM CHROME OR UM TIN,IT DON'T STIMK TO A LMRNFT

4382,THEY'RE BOTH THE DIGESTIVE SYSTEM I THINK,THER BTH JUSITHINK
4383,I NOTICE THAT THEY BOTH HAVE DOTS BUT THE OTHER ONE ONE OF THEM HAS LIKE HAS LIKE SQUARES AND STUFF AROUND IT BUT THE OTHER JUST HAS JUST IS JUST YEAST JUST,FDOEE
4384,IT MOVES FOOD DOWN INTO THE STOMACH LIKE AFTER YOU CHEW IT IT GOES DOWN IN THE ESOPHAGUS TO GO INTO THE STOMACH TO GO INTO THE SMALL INTESTINE TO GO INTO BIG INTESTINES AND TO GO INTO THE WASTE,TTHTHEA
4385,I DON'T KNOW WHAT'S UP WITH IT,UNRAH
4386,I SEE SKIN CELLS,ICZELLS
4387,STOMACH FURTHER BREAKS DOWN FOOD THROUGH MECHANICAL AND CHEMICAL,O FOTHER AW C NCAC
4388,SAYS THAT MOUTH BREAKS BREAKS FOOD DOWN IN SMALLER PIECES WITH TEETH AND SALIVA I ALREADY KNEW THAT BY WATCHING A VIDEO JUST TO LET YOU KNOW,T MT  D PAES WITH EATH N SIS

4390,UHM THAT IT'S LIVING AND HUMANS ARE LIVING SO THEY'RE BOTH LIVING,THN HUMON ARLNA
4391,THIS THIS PICTURE IS THE DIGESTIVE SYSTEM LEARNING ABOUT THE DIGESTIVE SYSTEM AND THIS THIS THING HERE IS THE DIGESTIVE SYSTEM FOR THE BUTTERFLY,THPICTERR JUSSTMITHEBUTEF
4392,IT'S SHOWING US LIKE EVERYTHING ABOUT HOW IT WORKS YEAH STUFF LIKE THAT,IT SHAWINGS LIK VRTHIKABOUT
4393,I'M GOOD,I'M GOOD
4394,IT GOES THROUGH LIKE THE SMALL INTESTINE AND IT GOES TO THROUGH TO THE BIG INTESTINES TO COME INTO THE WASTE AND THEN IT GOES OUT,KEATESGE MAEO
4395,I NOTICE MUSCLE OR WHATEVER THAT THOSE LITTLE THINGS ARE THAT ARE IN THE LIKE LEG,I NOTS AR
4396,NOTHING I DON'T KNOW,NTHINUNOLL
4397,I THINK IT'S SHOWING US THE DIGESTIVE SYSTEM AND HOW THE REST OF YOUR BODY'S LIKE THE LITTLE INTESTINES AND THE BIG INTESTINES AND IT GOES THROUGH AND IT BECOMES WASTE,I THINK IM SS IKE V
4398,WE'VE BEEN STUDYING ABOUT,WOVE  STADIYBOUT
4399,THE STOMACH IT HOLDS LIKE ALL OF THE FOOD THAT GOES DOWN THE ESOPHAGUS AND THEN IT GOES INTO THE SMALL INTESTINE WELL IT'S ALL OF THE FOOD THAT YOU CHEW DOWN,THTAL OWN THE S

4424,IT'S A CONSUMER BECAUSE YOU EAT THEY EAT OTHER ANIMALS,CMER CHER  ML
4425,THE GROUND,GROWN
4426,I DON'T KNOW,
4427,CAUSE BECAUSE BEARS THAT'S ALL THAT REALLY EATS MEAT AND HIPPOS BUT THE OTHER ANIMALS DON'T REALLY EAT MEAT THEY EAT LIKE BANANAS AND OTHER STUFF,BECAUSB LY ET TTHE OTHER ANMLE  LIKE
4428,THE OWL A BIRD THE BEETLE A LIZARD THE BUNNY AND THE SNAKE,THE  BBT ITHSEK
4429,THAT THEY MAKE SOIL,TMC OYAL

4435,I DON'T KNOW,TN
4436,BECAUSE THEY ALL EAT MEAT CAUSE THE TIGER THE LION THE WOLF AND THE SHARK AND ALL OF THEM EAT MEAT SO THAT'S PRETTY MUCH HOW THEY CONNECT,BECASHERIN ALL RY MCH
4437,THING THAT MAKES THEM REALLY FAT,HINAS SOM RELIEHAH
4438,IT IS A MUSHROOM,MOH

4440,THEY'RE ALL ABOUT I THINK THE SOIL AND OTHER STUFF I'M NOT REALLY SURE I CAN'T REMEMBER,THI ALABOTITO TF NOT REALLY SORE
4441,THEY'RE A CONSUMER BECAUSE BACTERIA AND FUNGI THEY DO PRETTY MUCH THE SAME THING TO ANIMALS AND FOODS,THUMER BECNR MUCH LIKE THE SAME THINAM
4442,A CARNIVORE,
4443,CARNIVORE,FOURE
4444,I THINK IT'S A CONSUMER BECAUSE IT EATS OTHER CONSUMERS THEY EAT PLANTS AND MEAT BUT STILL IT EATS CONSUMERS LIKE A LOT OF DIFFERENT THINGS LIKE PEOPLE FISH,I THINK  BECAS EH CUPLATA TUMRAO DRNT THINKGS LIK PEOPL

4449,CAN YOU PLEASE REPEAT,COUL YOU PLEAS
4450,IT IT HELPS THE ENVIRONMENT ACTUALLY BECAUSE THEY EAT PAPER AND OTHER STUFF SO I THINK THAT HELPS THE ENVIRONMENT,P THELYBECAUSE THERTOFF
4451,THEY MAKE SOIL AND HELP PLANTS GROW,THM YL  HPEFCA

4462,WELL IT HAS EVERYTHING IT HAS A WATER THE AIR THE SUNLIGHT AND EVERYTHING IT NEEDS TO GROW AND LOOK,WILS ERYSAEAERTING EAT
4463,IT NEEDS SUNLIGHT TO GROW BECAUSE IF IT DOESN'T HAVE ANY SUNLIGHT IT JUST FLOPS,SO
4464,WELL IT JUST NEEDS WATER OXYGEN CARBON DIOXIDE SUNLIGHT AND YEAH THAT'S ABOUT IT TO SURVIVE,E JUSTES WATER O N AO
4465,WELL IT LOOKS A LITTLE BETTER BUT IT STILL NEEDS WATER TO GROW BECAUSE LIKE THAT'S THE MAIN THING THAT IT NEEDS IT NEEDS THE WATER TO GET IT ALL LIKE ALL LIKE WOO AWAKE SO IT CAN GROW MORE,BATER WATERKEWATER
4466,BECAUSE IT HAS ALL THE SUNLIGHT IT NEED ALL THE AIR IT NEEDS AND ALL THE WATER IT NEEDS,BECAUS HASET H EATHE WATER
4467,MAKE THEIR OWN FOOD BECAUSE UHM I CAN'T REMEMBER WHAT IT'S CALLED THE SUGAR LIKE THE SUGAR LEAVES THE STUFF IN THE PLANT TO FOR IT TO GROW,E GSF IN THE PLAT
4468,UH NOT SURE,
4469,THERE'S NO AIR SO THAT JUST MAKES IT WORSE IT'S PROBABLY JUST GOING TO DIE RIGHT AWAY,THES M S

4496,THE EYES THE HEART AND THE ORGANS,A IN THE ORGON
4497,I THINK I THINK IT HAS TO DO WITH SYSTEMS IS BECAUSE THAT THERE'S A LOT OF THINGS THAT CAN MOVE LIKE A HUMAN BODY A SUITCASE CAR THE EARTH I DON'T KNOW I'M NOT VERY SURE,I THINKI THINK AHOT THINGS IKEA
4498,I AM NOT SURE,

4515,I WOULD CHANGE,HOCHANGE
4516,THAT SOME OF THEM CAN BE SHORTER AND LONGER AND THAT TAKES DIFFERENT MEASUREMENTS MMM HMM YEAH,TH THEM CAN BE SNGS DIFRENT MEASERMONTS
4517,THAT W TEN CENTIMETERS WOULD BE HALF FROM MY WRIST TO MY ELBOW,TTH ENTANMEATORES WIL BE A FROM M IT TO M ELBO
4518,YEAH AND THEN WE MADE OUR OWN METER STICKS THAT HAS CENTIMETERS AND DECAMETERS IT BUT IT DOESN'T HAVE INCHES,AAER STICKHAS S ADORINTHEAR DOESN'T HAVE
4519,NOT EXACTLY,NOTEGACT
4520,UH I FORGOT,I
4521,YEAH CAUSE SOMETIMES YOU DON'T BRING A RULER TO WHERE YOU'RE GOING AND THEN YOU NEED TO SHOW WHERE IT IS,SOMTIMES YOU DN'T IN  ROLLR T  S
4522,YEAH,
4523,THAT'S ABOUT FROM THE BACK OF THIS CHAIR TO OLIVIA BACK THERE,TBAK  AR TO A LIIOBT TH
4524,YEAH THAT MEANS THAT IT'S TEN STRAWS ACROSS FROM ME AND THEN THREE STRAWS THIS WAY,THAT MEN TENT ACROFHREA
4525,NO,NOW
4526,WE MEASURED OUR DESKS IN STRAWS,WE MESARED AR ES IN STRAWS
4527,WELL THAT THEY ARE THAT THEY SOMETIMES DO WRONG MEASUREMENTS CAUSE THEY GET BENT AND STUFF AND THEN THAT SHRINKS EM A LITTLE BIT,SOMTIMES T RO MASERMENTC STFT INGAT
4528,THAT T THE DRY SPONGE IS TWO GRAMS THE WET SPONGE IS SIXTEEN GRAMS AND THE WATER WA SO THE WATER WAS FOURTEEN GRAMS,SXTHATERATER FORTN AN
4529,T FOR SCRUBBING FOR SCRUBBING BECAUSE YOU CAN GET A LOT OF WATER IN IT AND THEN WHEN YOU PUSH DOWN THE WATER COMES OUT AND THEN YOU CAN DO THE SAME THING TO PUT SOAP IN IT,YOU CAN GET RWATERWEN YOU PUSH DOWN THE ATER  TH SAMTHNG
4530,IT'S WEIGHING IT AND THE SPONGE IS THERE AND IT'S HEAVIER THAN THIN AIR,AINGIN THE SPUNSH  R
4531,TWO GRAMS,GRON
4532,A BALANCE,AVOUNC
4533,YEAH ABSORBS IT,
4534,THE SPONGE IS GROWING BIGGER,N  ROINIGER
4535,LIKE YESTERDAY WE WEIGHED LIKE PENCILS AND OTHER STUFF,YUSTERDAY WE RAED LIKED PANES INHER A
4536,UM IT WEIGHS SIXTEEN GRAMS MMM HMM,TH  SIX TE GRAONDS
4537,IT HAS TWO GRAMS IN THERE AND THEN IT HAS A SPONGE ON THE OTHER SIDE AND IT'S EXACTLY EQUAL,TWO GRANDSIN THRA PN ON THERSD AACT EACLE
4538,FROM HERE I SUBTRACTED TWO TO SIXTEEN AND THAT'S FOURTEEN S SO THAT'S HOW MUCH THE WATER WAS,WOT SIX TEFORTNATERA
4539,NO DRY AND THEN WET,NODR
4540,NO WE DIDN'T HAVE ENOUGH TIME,YUDIN'T HAVE AFTIM
4541,IT'S SUCKING IT IN AND HOLDING IT IN THE AIR BUBBLES,IRCAN GETHOLDININ THE AIRBUELE
4542,HI,
4543,I DIDN'T MAKE A CHART THERE WAS JUST QUESTIONS TO ANSWER,IIDN'TMKE A JUST CUSIONS
4544,YEAH,
4545,PROBABLY,TUH
4546,THAT TOLD ME THE MASS OF THE WATER,TOL TH WATER
4547,YEAH,
4548,YEAH WE HAD A LITTLE PIECE OF PAPER TO WRITE IT DOWN ON,WE HAD A LLPAPERI
4549,MOST OF EM,MOST
4550,THAT THE WATER WEIGHED A L HAD A LOT OF MASS,WI THE WATTERHAD A MA
4551,YEAH,
4552,YEAH,
4553,YUP,
4554,WITH THAT IT MADE IT IT MADE THE WATER MADE THE SPONGE IN OUR WAY IT MADE THE SPONGE WEIGH FIFTY GRAMS WHEN IT WAS ONLY THREE,THE ATER S   FIFTY GRANS WHEN ET WAS ONLY THREE
4555,THE WA IT'S ABSORBING THE WATER,ABSARVEN THE WATER
4556,IT WOULD START POURING OUT,OUT
4557,YEP,
4558,THAT ALL THE LITTLE BUBBLES FILLED WITH WATER,AS FIELLD WITH WATER
4559,YEAH,Y
4560,IT'S GOT A WET SPONGE THAT WEIGHS,IS CAA  FOA
4561,SOME A LOT,SOME
4562,WHAT DID I DO TO FIGURE OUT THE DIFFERENCE I MULTIPLIED,ICED O T  MOLTY
4563,YEAH I TOOK AWAY TO FIND,FIN
4564,YEAH,
4565,THEY ALL ABSORB,LLF
4566,PROBABLY UM WEIGHING OTHER STUFF,CA THER STAM
4567,IT WOULD START SLOWLY POURING OUT,W TA SLLY POUG
4568,YEAH,
4569,BECAUSE THE POINT IS POINTING STRAIGHT DOWN,BECAU THE PNT IS PNA STREET DWN
4570,NOTHING JUST AIR,NOTHING
4571,NO SUBTRACTION,BJECTID
4572,WELL THERE E THE WATER ITSELF WEIGHED FORTY SEVEN GRAMS,TH WATER SELLED FOURTY SEVEN GRAND
4573,MMM HMM AND THAT IT HA WAS PRETTY HEAVY,ANTHE W PRTY Y
4574,YEAH,
4575,TWENTY ST IT COULD ABSORB E SEVENTEEN TIMES AS MUCH,TWENTYRVH SEVEN T TIMES  MCH
4576,THEY'RE PROBABLY IS BUT I DON'T REMEMBER IT,OBSN'TR
4577,WE UM BUILT OUR BOATS OUT OF LITTLE PAPER CUPS WITH WAX,THLERBOTS  LEPAPERCP WITH AGS
4578,WELL WE USED PENNIES AS PASSENGERS AND THE SIZE WAS IMPORTANT SO THAT WE COULD SEE HOW MANY PASSENGERS IT COULD HOLD,W  PAN  PANERSWECAERAHL
4579,SEE YA,SIR
4580,YOU TOO,MUTU
4581,UM WE WOULD PUT THE PENNIES IN CAREFULLY AND KEEP IT BALANCED ON ALL SIDES SO THAT IT DIDN'T SINK AS QUICKLY,D PUT THE PONY N CARFNCEP BVLLNTS ON
4582,THANK YOU,E
4583,THEY'RE DESIGNED TO FLOAT AND HOLD PEOPLE,TH DESIN TNHLD PEOPLE
4584,IT SH THEY EACH SHOW UM HOW MANY MILLILITERS OF WATER THEY EACH HOLD,TH EAT M LADR OF WATER
4585,EACH ARE DIFFERENT HEIGHT AND UM THEY EACH SINK UH LOWER AND HIGHER IN TO THE WATER DEPENDING ON HOW TALL THEY ARE,ETH ARE DRNT NK LURN HIGHERNTO THE WATERP
4586,THEY MIGHT HAVE BEEN UM DIFFERENT CUPS AND THEY MIGHT NOT HAVE BEEN EQUALLY UM MADE AND UH CUT LEVELLY,THEY MIGHT BEN DRNT COPS ANTHEY MT NOT HAVE BN EACALL
4587,UM IT WAS UH LIKE IT WAS ACTUALLY THE WATER THAT WE UM TOOK OUT OF THE THINGS AND THEN PUT THEM IN THIS CONTAINER THAT SHOWED MILLILITERS AND THAT'S HOW WE GOT OUR RESULTS,ACTLYAEOO THNSPTT CAALATERI RESOLTS
4588,UM I WAS AMAZED TO SEE THAT WHEN WE PUT THE PASSENGERS IN UM UM JUST A LITTLE CUP OF YOU PUT A CIRCLE AROUND IT AND EVEN THE BALANCE THEN IT MAY IT YOU COULD GET A LOT OF PASSENGERS IN THERE,EWE PTTH ANERNPT CIRCL ROUNEVENTHET ALOEPAERSINE
4589,WE MADE TWO BOATS THAT WERE THREE CENTIMETERS LONG,MATR THREE SENATERSONG
4590,BY UM DOING THEM UM CORRECTLY AND ORDERLY AND UH SLOWLY SO THAT YOU CAN GET UH ACCURATE DATA,M DUING THRECT ODER LYOUCN ET T
4591,UM I HAD ANOTHER DAY IN SCIENCE AND UH WE WORKED ON BOATS AND UM WE UH HAD VARIABLES AND OTHER LIKE THINGS AND IT WAS IN LIKE A LITTLE TUB,I HAD A OTHER SBW HAD VERBLE INLIKE A  TUB
4592,WELL WHEN WE MEASURED THEM WE MADE SURE THAT THEY WERE EACH UH DIFFERENT UM HEIGHT AND YEAH,WHN WE MERD THT  NTT
4593,GOOD,
4594,YOU COULD MAY BE ADD MORE PENNIES OR TAKE AWAY THE PENNY AND ADD SOMETHING UM DIFFERENT LIKE A DIFFERENT OBJECT TO IT,YAATW HIK A NT OBJECT T
4595,YOU HAVE TO PICK IT UP AND THEN LET IT SWING AND WHEN IT GOES BACK AND FORTH AND LIKE,YOU HAVE  PICKOT PN   SWANG INO BOE
4596,THAT WITH THE HIGHER SWINGS UM THE UM IN FIFTEEN SECONDS IT DID UM IT HAD MORE CYCLES,THAT WA E HIGER SNFIFTN SIRN HAD ICLBLE
4597,WHEN YOU PUT IT AT THE TOP IT STARTS BUT GRADUALLY IT'LL START TO UM DECREASE UM IN HOW HIGH IT GOES CAUSE THERE'S NOT ENOUGH FORCE AND THE WEIGHT IS WEIGHING IT DOWN,WHEN YOUPTO STARTERALY START TCAS THER NOTITHE DWN
4598,WELL WHEN IT SWINGS BACK AND FORTH THE WEIGHT WOULD CAUSE IT TO SINK LOWER AND NOT GO AS HIGH WHEN IT COMES BACK AROUND AND COMPLETES THE CYCLE,INGS BACKFEROWHENT MS BACKROPTLES
4599,IT MEANS THAT IT'S A CERTAIN THING IN AN EXPERIMENT THAT YOU COULD CHANGE OR KEEP THE SAME AND IT'S PART OF THE EXPERIMENT,THAT IS AIRNTIN NPEUCANCH  SRHPEN
4600,WELL THERE IS MORE UM THERE IS ONE ON ONE AND THEN LIKE IT GOES IN THE NUMBER OF HOW MANY THERE ARE AND I THINK WELL WELL OF COURSE IT WILL IT WOULD CAUSE MORE WEIGHT,THETE OES IN THE ERTHNKM
4601,WHEN I CLICK THE BOB GOES TO WHERE I CLICKED,H C THEBOBGOWS T
4602,WHAT'S THE TABLE FOR,S THE TABELG
4603,THE CYCLE IS WHEN IT GOES BACK AND BACK AND THEN BACK AGAIN TO WHERE IT USED TO BE,THSIK WEN GBBAKGN
4604,YES,
4605,YES,YGES
4606,UH AT THE END OF THE STRING THERE IS ITS WEIGHT AND IT WILL KEEP THE STRING MOVING,THENILLEP A SRING MOING
4607,WELL SINCE IT'S AT THE END OF THE STRING IT WILL CAUSE THE STRING NOT TO GO FLIMSY AND AROUND,BLANT AO FROM ZVIAND
4608,IT GOES DOWN AND UP AND THEN DOWN AND UP AGAIN TO UH THE PLACE WHERE IT WAS BUT IT'S STILL LOWER THAN,PANN D
4609,I MAY PUT UM SOMETHING THAT'S NOT A PENNY AND MAY BE IT WOULD CAUSE MORE WEIGHT,TON SOMTHINGTH AMBC
4610,MAY BE IF YOU UM HAD A BIGGER PENCIL TO HANG IT FROM THEN UM IT MIGHT UH AFFECT MAY BE HOW HIGH IT GOES,M HAD A BIGER PENSLETHAN FROMTH
4611,WHEN I DID IT TWO TIMES UH I REALIZED THAT THE CYCLES WERE THE SAME BOTH TIMES,NWO TIMERALLZE SICLE WIR THE SAMEBH
4612,YOU CAN SEE HOW MANY TIMES IT WILL S MAKE A CYCLE UM IN FIFTEEN SECONDS,YOU CAN SE HO MNY TIMEISON
4613,YOU CAN COLLECT IT ON A DATA FILE,YOU CAN COLLECTED ON A DIEFIR
4614,THAT WOULD DEPEND ON WHAT KIND OF VARIABLES THEY WERE AND WHAT THEY WERE CHANGING,H CINDO VERABLES TH
4615,THE LONGER THE UM PENDULUM THE SHORTER AMOUNT OF STRINGS THAT UH I MEAN THE SHORTER AMOUNT OF CYCLES THAT IT HAS,THE LER VNMTHTO STNGRT ATA ICL
4616,UM WELL UM I WELL I DON'T REALLY KNOW,HT ONT REALLY N
4617,AT THE X AXIS UM THERE'S NOTHING,EANING
4618,UM THE THINGS THAT UH HAS BEEN CHANGED IS THE LENGTH OF THE STRING UM WHICH THEY SWANG,N BNG CHAN THE LENGH OF THE SRIW
4619,THAT UM THE MORE THE CENTIMETERS THE LESS THE CYCLES SO IT GOES FROM ONE TWENTY TO FIFTEEN AND IT GOES FROM SEVEN TO TWENTY,R ENTMEATORTH LSSSILOS FROM O TNTY FIFTO FRO SEVEN TWENTY
4620,BYE,FV
4621,YES BECAUSE UM BECAUSE THEY ONLY CHANGED ONE VARIABLE FROM THE LONGER UH STRING,ABECAU MBECAUTHONLY CHANGED ONE VERRYOBLE FROM THE GER STRIN
4622,WELL WE UM DIDN'T CHANGE THE TIME BECAUSE WE KNEW FOR CERTAIN THAT THERE WOULD MORE UM SWINGS IF WE CHANGED THE TIME,DIDN'T CHANGE THE TIMEBECAUSE WE N FIRTINHER
4623,I FOUND OUT THAT THE SHORTER THE STRING THE UM THE LESS UH CYCLES IT HAS,I FOUND DTRTESRC
4624,I MEAN THE MORE CYCLES THAT IT HAS,M
4625,UM IT'S A PENDULUM WITH A BOB AT THE END AND IT'S ON A HIGH POINT UM AND IT'S HANGING FROM A PENCIL,A WITH A BOBT ON HI POINT HANGNG FROM PETL
4626,IT HAS CERTAIN FIXTURES AND UM IT DOESN'T CHANG IT DOESN'T CHANGE MUCH,T A ARN ICURDO DOSN'T CHANGE MUCH
4627,UM ON THE Y AXIS,THEOACTIS
4628,I MEAN THINGS THAT WE CHANGED IN UM DIFFERENT SERIES OF THE EXPERIMENT,I MN THINKS THAT WEAVE CHANGED IN N EEPERENT
4629,THEY ARE UM HOW MANY CYCLES AND THE LENGTH,TH ARA MNY SICLTS IN T LENGTH
4630,PRETTY GOOD,REANY GOOD
4631,I FOUND THE LENGTH OF HOW UM LONG THE STRINGS WERE AND OF HOW MANY CYCLES THEY HAD,I FOUND TE LENGTN Y SICLES THE HA
4632,UH I IN SCIENCE TODAY I LEARNED THAT WHEN YOU TRIED THE RELEASE POSITION IT DOESN'T CHANGE THE LENGTH OF HOW MANY CYCLES IT DID,N TOWENU THE ELI ONDOESN'T CHAGE TH LENGHOF
4633,WELL TODAY WE LEARNED HOW TO UM UH WE WELL WE WORKED ON PENDULUMS AGAIN AND WE UH SHOWED THEM AT DIFFERENT ANGLES AND WE CHANGED UM SOME VARIABLES,ED EROTWE CKED ON ERM WEED THEMRNT ANGLS AN WE CHAED SVERABLES
4634,UM SO THAT THINGS DON'T GET OUT OF CONTROL AND YOU DON'T HAVE TOO MANY UM THINGS THAT ARE NOT ALIKE,THINGS DN'T GET COLYOU DN'T HAVE TO MONY THIK
4635,WHEN IT WENT UM DOWN AND WENT BACK UP AGAIN IT WENT AT A SLIGHTLY LOWER UH PLACE,NTAN A S
4636,WE WERE TRYING TO FIND OUT HOW THE PENDULUMS WORKED AND UH WHAT MADE THEM DIFFERENT AND WHAT MADE THEM THE SAME,WER TRYN FINDOUT HA DERET INMA THE SAME
4637,IT DOESN'T MATTER UH HOW MUCH WEIGHT THERE IS UM IT JUST MATTERS HOW LONG THE STRING IS,I DOUSN'T MATTERHO MUCHHE I JUST MATTERES HO LONG THE STRINGI
4638,IT SHOWS ON THE TOP UH HOW MANY CYCLES IT HAD UM ON THE SIDE IT SHOWS HOW LONG THE STRINGS WAS,TTH TI HAD AHOWS HO LONG THE STREEN
4639,I WOULD PUT IT UM AFTER LIKE AFTER THE NAME OF THE BOAT AND I WOULD PUT IT THERE AFTER IN UNDER THE UH SIGN THAT SAYS CAPACITY AND TELL HOW MANY MILLILITERS,AFETHAMETHTHEPATY N TELL HO MONEY MELADORS
4640,M YOU CAN FIGURE OUT HOW MANY PENNIES CAN GO IN TO IT AND HOW MUCH WATER IT CAN HOLD,YOU CAN IE OUT HO MONEY PONYS CAN GO IN TMCH WATER N HOLDE
4641,UM WE DECIDED UM TO KEEP THE KIND OF CUP THE IT WAS AND THE CONSTRUCTION OF THE CUP AND HOW IT WAS CUT NOT THE LENGTH BUT YEAH UM WE ALSO DECIDED HOW MUCH WATER WE HAD IN THE TUB TO KEEP THE SAME AND YEAH,HNWE DESIDTED TO KEP TH CONISION THE SA
4642,WELL WE MADE FOUR DIFFERENT SIZES SO THAT WE COULD SEE HOW MANY PENNIES EACH COULD HOLD AND THE AMOUNT OF WATER THEY COULD EACH HOLD,WEMAG FOR DRENTP GLD ELD
4643,THEY STAY THE SAME AND UM UH DON'T MAKE THE EXPERIMENT TOO DIFFERENT THAN IT MIGHT HAVE U MIGHT HAVE BEEN OR USED TO BE,THE STAIGE THE SAME AMAK THE EXPERMENT T DIRNT
4644,OH I WOULD PUT IT ON THE BOTTOM,PUTIT ONHEBOTTM
4645,AND ALSO SETTING UP A DATA CHART,DINGPADSERT
4646,THE CAPACITY GOES ON THE BOTTOM AND UH THE NUMBER OF PASSENGERS GOES ON THE SIDE,THE COPAY GOWES ON THEDT NMBER PASSONDERS G
4647,WE USED THE SYRINGE TO UM UH TAKE THE WATER OUT AND UH PUT THEM IN A LITTLE CONTAINER THAT MEASURED IN MILLILITERS UH TO SEE HOW MANY MILLILITERS EACH CUP COULD HOLD,NK THE ATTERT CAAMELARHLD
4648,UH I FORGOT WHAT A STANDARD PROCEDURE IS,I FRUT SA AGR
4649,IT DOESN'T UM CAUSE THE BOAT TO SINK AND THEN POP UP AGAIN CAUSE WHEN IT DOES THAT THEN THE WATER MIGHT SPLASH IN TO IT AND CAUSE IT TO SINK FASTER,DO WATER ME PLASH ION TO TAND COST T INK FASTER
4650,WE UH USED DIFFERENT UH HEIGHTS IN THE CUPS AND BUT WE KEPT EVERYTHING ELSE THE SAME AND WE ONLY CHANGED ONE VARIABLE WHICH MADE IT A CONTROLLED EXPERIMENT,TITH EVERY THNG THE SAME OCVE
4651,UM THE VARIABLE THAT'S BEING CHANGED IS THE HEIGHT OF THE CUPS AND YEAH,HE EB BEN AED IN THE HIGHT OC
4652,WE HAD TO THINK ABOUT HOW WE WERE GOING TO PUT THEM IN AND UH WE HAD TO PREDICT HOW MANY WOULD FIT IN THERE BEFORE IT'S SUNK,T THINK ABOUT HO WER NIIN THER
4653,WE WE UM USED THE UM WAIT,WE T THE AUM
4654,IT UM STAYS A CONTROLLED EXPERIMENT,CAN OLLD ECXPERMENT
4655,WE CHANGED THE LENGTH OF THE CUPS TO SEE HOW MANY HOW MUCH WATER AND HOW MANY PENNIES THEY COULD HOLD AND THE PENNIES WERE PASSENGERS,THHANGE THE LENGM WATERNPPAER
4656,ONLY ONE VARIABLE TO KEEP IT CONTROLLED,ONLY ONE VEERBL TO CEP  CONOLLE
4657,YEAH YEAH,PY
4658,UM STANDARD'S LIKE UM LIKE MORE,M STANARDS LIKEIKAR
4659,UM YOU,E
4660,TRY TO MAKE IT EVEN,RY TO MAK EV
4661,YEAH,Y
4662,YEAH,
4663,YEAH WE DID S UM SOMETHING WITH PAPER CLIPS UM WELL WE GOT THE DIFFERENT THINGS BECAUSE THE PAPER CL BECAUSE WE WERE MEASURING THE WOODPILE WOODS W AND,AERGHT  RNTM BCSHECAUSE W INTH
4664,YEAH BECAUSE WE HAVE A SUBSTITUTE,BECAUSE WE HA A
4665,YEAH WITH THE GRAVEL,GRVEL

4786,PROBABLY BUT WE'D EITHER HAVE TO CUT A WIRE IN HALF OR GET RID OF ONE WIRE AND GET TWO SHORTER ONES,ER  ON WATERN GET RDN GET ONS
4787,GOOD,
4788,WHAT DO YOU MEAN,E
4789,CAUSE UM THAT ONE'S MADE OF ONE'S MADE OF PLASTIC AND ONE'S MADE OF WOOD ONE'S MADE OF METAL PROBABLY THE METAL IS THE HEAVIEST THE PL THEN THE WOOD THEN THE PLASTIC,BECAUWE  JUST TOSEVE ALLOWE MOR THEN THE THERS
4790,YOU'RE WELCOME,UOGUM
4791,WE'VE BEEN DOING THE VISION AND WEIGHING,WEAVEN DUING DEVISIONA

5442,WELL IF SUN IS SHARING THE CELL THEN ITS WORKING BUT WHEN IT GOES OFF THERE IS NO WORK AND THE FLAG WILL,THE SON OF AING  A
5443,THE ELECTRICITY WILL GO THROUGH THE D CELL AND IT WILL TURN ON THE FLAG,
5444,THE D CELLS ELECTRICITY MAKES THE FLAG MOVE,
5445,THE ELECTRICITY GOES THROUGH THE WIRES AND UNTIL IT'S CELL AND THEN IT GOES INTERACT WHEN WILL CONTRACTION AND THEN IT MAKES THE FLAG MOVE,THRETH ATER NT
5446,IT MAKES THE FLAG MOVE,MAK TH FLAGOO
5447,NO NAIL,NG
5448,AND ELECTRICITY GO THROUGH THE TWO WIRES TO MAKE A FLAG MOVE BECAUSE THE FLAG IS METAL ON BOTH SIDES SO THE METAL TOUCHES THAT IT TURNS ON MAKE THROUGH ELECTRICITY,FL
5449,THE CELL HAS BEHIND THE SUN AND THEN THE WIRES CONNECT ALL THE WAY TO THE CONTRACTION AND THEN MAKE REFLECTIVE SO ELECTRICITY GOES THROUGH THE FEW THING OVER AND OVER AND OVER,TH ELL HAS BEAMENT
5450,IT'S ON THE METAL WHERE THE WIRE IS SO IT DOESN'T COUNT ALL THE WAY BUT IT GOES ON LIKE SO THERE JUST IT IS ELECTRICITY PASS THERE SO THEY WAS ON TOP WHAT A PRETTY AS MUCH ELECTRICITY,EO
5451,THE ELECTRICITY GOING THROUGH,AT Y
5452,BECAUSE THEY DIDN'T THEN IT WHAT IF WORK AS WELL AS A IT'S DOWN SO WHILE WE ITS DARK ANYTHING OUTSIDE WILL NOT WORK,BECAUSEW SD
5453,IT'S NOT GOING TO TILL BECAUSE THE SWITCHES OFF AND IT'S NOT CREATING A CIRCUIT TO MAKE THE FLAG MOVE,BCIRUT
5454,NO,
5455,IT'S NOT TOUCHING METAL SO WHERE ELECTRICITY WON'T GO TO THE FLAG AND IT WILL MAKE A CIRCUIT,TOTHEFL
5456,BECAUSE THE D CELL HAS ELECTRICITY IN IT SO WHEN THEN TWO CONNECTERS CONNECT TO THE METAL FIND ON BOTH SIDES AS THE SWITCH TOUCHES METAL THEN IT WILL START WORKING AND CREATE AND PUT IT WOULD ELECTRICITY TO THE FLAG,AUSETTMEO
5457,THE D CELL IS AT A CIRCUIT,T DE ND A I
5458,THOSE ARE ALSO THAT ELECTRICITY SO WHEN YOU PUT TWO WIRES ON THEY AND PUT A SET TO A D CELL AND PUTTING INTO SUN THEN VIBRATING TO BE LIKE THAT ELECTRICITY GOING THROUGH THAT CELL,
5459,IT HAS TO BE ON THE METAL,HASTBOE
5460,WE'VE HAS BEEN CREATING CIRCUIT,WEAVEAINGH IU
5461,THEN IT DOESN'T WORK,A
5462,THAT WHEN I TOUCH IT IT MOVES AND THEN I TOUCH IT AGAIN IT MOVES OFF THE CIRCUIT SO IT WILL PRODUCE THE ELECTRICITY BUT WON'T DOES TOUCH THE METAL AND PRODUCES ELECTRICITY,THHNTHETHR
5463,BECAUSE WHEN THE WIRE FIX THE D CELL AND OTHER ELECTRICITY DOESN'T LIKE CONTRACTED LIKE THEY CONTRACTED TOO,EAU
5464,THE FLAG MOVES,FLAGMEONT
5465,IT WOULDN'T WORK BECAUSE THAT'S BE SEMI AND MIKE HAS BEEN GETTING IT,THE

5467,THE D CELL AND THE ELECTRICITY,EEL
5468,THE D CELL HAS TO BE ATTRACTED TWO WIRES TO GO THROUGH THE ELECTRICITY TO GET TO THE MOVE,TO
5469,THE FLAG STOPS MOVING BECAUSE IT DOES THE SUNLIGHT AND IT IS HAVE ELECTRICITY BETWEEN THE WIRES,THE FL STOPSOM THE RIN BECA
5470,NO METAL IS PUT TOUCHING THOSE TWO WIRES AND LIKE THAT AND CONNECT STILL JUST READY TO GET THE,N ROTO

7116,IT MEANS THAT YOU ONLY EAT PLANTS,IT MEANYOU ONLY EAT PLANTS
7117,LIKE A FOOD WEB OR A FOOD CHAIN AND WHAT THEY EAT AND WHAT EATS THEM,KEOWAO CHE TH EAT IN
7118,IT MAKES THEM DECOMPOSERS,MAK DECOMPOUSURES

9131,UH WELL WE PUT IT ON WRONG SO OR I TWISTED IT WRONG AND SO WHEN I TWISTED IT ONE WAY IT STARTED GOING BACKWARDS,ONRGN BACKD
9132,YEAH MMM HMM,
9133,UH THEY ARE LIKE THE STANDARD THING THAT MAKES IT FLY OR IN WHAT YOU NEED TO MAKE IT FLY,TH  LIKE THA STANR THING ANWI YOU NED TOM F
9134,YEAH,
9135,TE,T
9136,MMM THAT WE C UM,A
9137,THAT IT GOES BACKWARDS WHEN YOU TWIST IT AND RIGHT IS THE WAY IT GOES FORWARD YEAH YEAH,TGOS BACK DS N YO TWSNRA THEA GOS FD
9138,UH WELL BECAUSE WE COULDN'T REALLY CHANGE THAT S YET AND SO WE JUST KEPT IT YOU AT THE TIME YOU COULD ONLY CHANGE ONE VARIABLE AND SO,IBECAUE WE CAN RLY CHAGE  TIME YOU CAN ONLY CHANGE NE VERBLE
9139,AND THEN OUR STANDARD WAS WE DIDN'T REALLY HAVE ANY PASSENGERS SO WHEN WE PUT MORE PASSENGERS ON WE CHANGED THE VARIABLES A LOT,STARD DIDN'RLY AVE Y PASON RWHEN WE PUT RD PANERS CHANED THE VERBLE
9140,WE CHANGED LIKE ONE PART OF THE WHOLE STANDARD THING,WEV CHANGED LIKE PATHSTAR N
9141,YEAH,Y
9142,IT REALLY JUST AFFECTED IT A LOT BECAUSE USUALLY WITHOUT E WITH THE SAME AMOUNT OF WEIGHT THAT IT HAD BEFORE IT KEPT IT ON THE SAME THING,RALLY JUSECTEDBC YULY WITHTHE SAMEFRON THE SAMEIN
9143,HI,
9144,ER NO IT MADE IT NOT AS GO NOT AS FAR,ERNDOA
9145,UH WELL WE JUST USED THE STANDARD PROPELLER SPEED,WILL E JUS AE THE STANDERD FOR H
9146,WE JUST HA WE HAD TO CHANGE THE AMOUNT OF SPINS FOR THE PROPELLER YEAH OR ELSE IT WOULDN'T GET ACROSS AT ALL,WEJWE HAD A CHANGE SLEAEPONS FOR THEERNT GET A COL
9147,WE HAVE TO USE THEM A LOT CAUSE WE CHANGE EM AND KEEP EM THE SAME AND CHANGE EM AND,WI THE ACA WM THE SN
9148,YEAH MMM HMM,Y
9149,UM WE SPUN IT EIGHTY TIMES AND IT GOT ALL THE WAY ACROSS YEAH,WE'VE SPANT EIGH TIMES INTHEWYCROSSY
9150,UM WELL IT IF IT WELL THERE YOU TWIST OKAY THERE'S A COUPLE WAYS THAT YOU CAN TWIST IT IF YOU TWIST IT ONE WAY IT'LL GO BACKWARDS AND ANOTHER WAY IT'LL GO FORWARDS,HES A CPLE ASYOU CNWA BACKNNOTHER WAYD
9151,IT'S PROBABLY GONNA MAKE IT SLOW DOWN A LOT,L   SLO  DOWN THE
9152,UH I LOVE TO WRITE AND DO MATH,I LOVED TRIT I U MAT
9153,UM YEAH,Y
9154,IF YOU LIKE CHANGED HOW MANY PROPELLERS OR SOMETHING THAT WAS ON THERE IT MIGHT GO FARTHER OR FASTER,ETH  TCHAN PARS R SOME THING THE ON  GO FAR THEFASTER
9155,UM WELL THOSE TOOTHPICKS IT HELPS HOLD THE PROPELLER IN SO IT'D STAY ON AND WON'T FALL OFF MMM HMM,OS TOTPS HOLD THE IRPELER NN'TFO
9156,HMM I WOULD HAVE TO SAY READING,I WLD HAVE TOSAVE READING
9157,YEAH WE HAVEN'T CHA WE'RE GONNA LIKE PUT LITTLE PAPER CLIPS ON IT,WEHAVG PT  PAPER TS ON
9158,UM WE'VE BEEN DOING A LOT OF THINGS LIKE WE'RE RIGHT NOW WE'RE LEARNING HOW LIKE ABOUT AIRPLANES AND PROPELLERS AND THAT SORT OF THING,WEVE EN DUING A LOGH THINGS LIKEN THIKE ABO AIRPLAN BPERS IN THAT SIRTO THIN
9159,YEAH,Y
9160,MMM HMM YEAH,S
9161,MMM HMM YEAH,YL
9162,UM WE START AT ONE SIDE OF THE CHAIR AND WE START SPINNING THE PROPELLER AND THEN WE HOLD IT AND WE WAIT AND THEN WE LET IT GO AND IT JUST GOES STRAIGHT ACROSS,WE STARTED  ONSIGHE  TH AARING THRERGOI TREETOS
9163,PROBABLY MAKING IT FLY CAUSE IT TOOK US A REALLY LONG TIME TO MAKE IT GO THE CERTAIN AMOUNT,I TOOK A OF REALIE LNG TIME TAANE
9164,YEAH,
9165,I DON'T REALLY UNDERSTAND HOW IT'D FLY I JUST DOES IT LIKE SUCK IN THE A I JUST DON'T KNOW IF IT SUCKS IN THE AIR TO MAKE IT OR PUSHES OUT AIR TO MAKE IT GO,' REALLY NERSTAN K IN'T  IN THE ARMPS TE
9166,UM MAKE IT GO FASTER OR MAYBE FARTHER,MA N GO FASTER MA FARTHER
9167,YEAH MMM HMM,Y
9168,UM UH WELL UH,L
9169,UH IT WAS BETWEEN LIKE THIRTY FIVE AND FORTY ABOUT,IT WAS BEWE CE THEIRTY FIVE EN FIOURTY AO
9170,LIKE Y YOU'D LIKE TWIST THE PROPELLER SO IT GETS THE PUSH OF IT HELPS THE PLANE GLIDE OR GET PUSHED ACROSS,LIKE TWS THE PRPEATERSOHP THAYUSH ACROSS
9171,UM IF YOU GO LEFT IT WOULD GO BACKWARDS AND RIGHT IT'D GO FORWARD,BAL L GO BACGDIN RFOR
9172,UH IT'D BE SORTA LIKE THE PASSENGERS ON THE PLANE,N BE SORTED LIKE  PASER W THELAN
9173,YEAH,
9174,I DIDN'T KNOW THAT THE PLANE WOULD FLY THAT EASILY JUST STRAIGHT ACROSS,D NOHE PLANE WL FL TH A JUST STRAHT A CROS
9175,YEAH,
9176,OKAY,
9177,UH I'M THE I HAVE BEEN THE BEST READER IN MY GRADES FOR THE PAST SEVEN YEARS YEAH,I HOVE BEN THE BEST REATER M GRA FOR THE PASSEVEN YEAR YEA
9178,BECAUSE THE PAPER CLIPS MAKE IT A LOT HEAVIER AND USUALLY IT'S JUST LIGHTS AND IT IT'LL JUST FLY ACROSS BUT WITH THE PAPER CLIPS,BECAUSE THE PAERS MAKEYSIHT N ER JUST FLH CRAER
9179,THEY'RE LIKE ABOUT THAT BIG AND YOU HOOK EM ONTO THE PLANE AND WE'RE GONNA SEE HOW MANY CAN GET ACROSS WITHOUT MAKING IT STOP,TH KEG THEANSE HO MONEY CAN GET A CROSE STM
9180,YEAH,
9181,YEAH,
9182,UM WELL THE STRAWS JUST HELP IT KEEP IT ON THE STRINGS SO THAT IT CAN FLY,TAS JUST EP ON THE STRING STHT CAN F
9183,YEAH AND THE PROPELLER IS REALLY THE MAIN THING CAUSE IT REALLY GETS THE PUSH IT JUST MAKE IT GO RIGHT ACROSS,EN THE PRPEATER IS REALLY TAM THNGUSHGO RAROSS
9184,YEAH,
9185,YEAH IT W,P
9186,YEAH,Y
9187,OH THE DIFFERENT CENTIMETERS ON THE STICK,THE IFRNT CNMATOR ON THE STICK

9192,MMM HMM YEAH,S
9193,YEAH IF,SER
9194,WE UM WE CHANGED THE VARIABLES BY MAKING THE MASS OF THE TIN FOIL SQUARES BIGGER LIKE WE'LL GO TO THIRTY CENTIMETER TIN FOIL SHEETS AND THEN SO ON,WE TCHANGED THE VEABLEMAKING  MATH OF THE TENTCGELG THARTY S
9195,IT WOULD GO A LOT FARTHER CAUSE IT HAS LESS WEIGHT AND,WOD GO A  FARTHERCT AS LES
9196,UH ALL THE WAY IN YEAH IS YEAH,EWAT IN  YAD
9197,YEAH YEAH,GEST
9198,IT WOULDN'T YOU COULDN'T REALLY COMPARE ANYTHING CAUSE YOUR ANSWERS TO IT WOULD BE ALL DIFFERENT AND YEAH,YOUCAN RL COPER THINGC ANTR TW E AL DRNT

9292,THIS IS THE D CELL BATTERY,BOUT
9293,WELL WHEN YOU DON'T HOOK IT UP RIGHT WITH THE WIRES AND THE BATTERY AND THE LIGHT BULBS,WILL EN YOU DON'T AOPERAT WITH THE ARA
9294,YES,E
9295,YEAH,Y
9296,WELL THE ENERGY COMES FROM THIS SIDE INTO THE LIGHT BULB,WIL THE ENARGY GUMS FROM SIDI TO THE LIHEBORG
9297,WELL WE WERE SUPPOSED TO USE ONE BUT OUR GROUP THOUGHT MAYBE TWO BATTERIES FOR TWO LIGHT BULBS BUT THAT DIDN'T REALLY WORK SO WE TOOK ONE D CELL,TTOBATERS FOR TWO AINREALLY
9298,YEAH,
9299,YES SOMETIMES,OMTIM
9300,YEAH,Y
9301,PROBABLY RIGHT HERE,AN
9302,YEAH KIND OF WE WERE LIKE UH MAYBE THIS ISN'T THE RIGHT WAY TO DO IT,MAE IRCT WA
9303,AND THEN THIS CONNECTS TO THE SWITCH,CEX TH
9304,YEAH,
9305,THE SWITCH IS WORKING IT'S A CLOSED CIRCUIT WHEN THE SWITCH IS WORKING AND WHEN IT'S OPEN IT'S AN OPEN CIRCUIT AND OPEN CIRCUITS DON'T WORK SO WHEN YOU LIFT IT UP IT WON'T WORK CAUSE IT'S AN OPEN CIRCUIT,THEA LTH IRNPEN OPN CIROPN IR
9306,AND THIS HOOKS UP TO THE LIGHT BULB CHAMBER,U THE AEBO
9307,IT'S HERE AND THAT,WRI
9308,THAT'S A SWITCH AND THEN THESE ARE WHERE YOU CONNECT THE WIRES,THECNICK TH WIR
9309,I THINK SO MAYBE,I THINK SO MA
9310,WELL,WO
9311,OKAY,PAI
9312,WELL,
9313,AND WE PROBABLY TOUCHED THE SWITCH TO,TE RUD TH TATCH T ST
9314,WELL,
9315,MOST OF THEM YEAH,MOSTAR
9316,HERE INTO THE OTHER,NTTHE OTHER
9317,OKAY,
9318,THAT HAVING TWO BATTERIES WOULD BE KIND OF HARDER SINCE YOU HAVE TWO LIGHT BULBS IT WOULD SEEM TO BE EASIER BUT BECAUSE WE HAVE TWO MORE ONE MORE TO H BATTERY TO HANDLE IT'S A LITTLE BIT HARDER,AN MB EASIERBECE WEER AD
9319,UM IT'S NOT CONNECTED SO THERE'S NO USUALLY A CIRCUIT WOULD GO LIKE THIS IT'S FULL,NOT CONECTEDAL  SIN G LIKE THI
9320,AND IT GOES THROUGH,ICOS THRO
9321,ENERGY AND THEN IT GOES OUT,ENAGYENIT GOS OUT
9322,THIS IS THE POSITIVE SIDE AND THIS IS THE NEGATIVE SIDE,THT
9323,YEAH MY TEACHER DID IT'S PARALLEL CIRCUITS WELL WE NOTICED THAT THE LIGHT BULB WHEN IT LIT UP IT WAS DULL SO PARALLEL CIRCUITS I THINK MAKE THEM LIGHT UP MORE,IWILLE NOTUSED TW IRS
9324,WHEN YOU CONNECT IT TO THE LIGHT BULB I IT HAS TO CONNECT TO METAL TO METAL OR IT WON'T WORK,WHEN YOU CNECTED TO THE LIB HAST MEO M
9325,THAT PARALLEL CAN NEVER TOUCH,THA IR COUL EVER TALK
9326,THE SWITCH MAKES THEM TURN ON AND OFF SO MAYBE IF YOU GO UP OR DOWN YOU COULD ALWAYS COME BACK TO OFF OR ON OR,THSICH MAKES THEM TRN ONNYOU CAN ALA  BACK TO
9327,NAH UH,
9328,SO THE LIGHT BULB CAN GET ALL OF IT'S,STH IBO C GETELEANT
9329,BECAUSE IT WAS KIND OF TOO COMPLICATED TO DO IT WITH TWO CAUSE YOU HAD TO FIGURE OUT A SPECIAL WAY WHEN WITH ONE BATTERY YOU COULD DO A WHOLE BUNCH OF WAYS,ECAS TEDAE Y
9330,THE PA NEGATIVE SIDE OF THE BATTERY AND THEN THIS WOULD HAVE THE POSITIVE SIDE,NSTHE BTTERTHS WD HAVE  POT
9331,YEAH,
9332,MMM HMM YAY,S
9333,YEAH,
9334,YEAH,
9335,SHE COULD PUT ANOTHER BULB IN,SCAHER
9336,THE LIGHT BULB DOES NOT LIGHT UP,DOES NOT A
9337,YEAH,
9338,ONLY ONE UH A BROTHER HE'S IN COLLEGE NOW THOUGH,ONLY BRATHER HE S INA CUC E
9339,A PARALLEL CIRCUIT IS WHEN THEY NEVER TOUCH SO IF ONE BULB GOES OUT IT'LL JUST BE OUT AND ALL THE OTHERS WILL JUST KEEP GOING BECAUSE WELL IT'S ITS OWN LITTLE CIRCUIT KIND OF,IRTH EVER TA GOSSTHEREP GING  SIR
9340,AN OPEN CIRCUIT IS WHEN UM IS WHEN MAYBE IF YOU HAVE A SWITCH IN A SERIES CIRCUIT AND YOU LIFT IT UP IT BECOMES AN OPEN CIRCUIT AND NOTHING HAPPENS,AN CIRUMB HA A SWTHINA IRCUMS A OPEN CIRNTHNHN
9341,WELL IT IT STOPS THE WHOLE LIGHT FROM BEING LIGHTED CAUSE IT MAKES AN OPEN CIRCUIT,PTHOL FROM BINGTEDCAS IT MAKS A OPEN CIRCUL
9342,PARALLEL,L
9343,I THINK IT WOULD GO OUT,GOOUT
9344,MMM HMM YEAH,S
9345,YES YEAH,
9346,ACTUALLY THAT ONE WOULD PROBABLY WELL,E THAT WON WIL PROTHE
9347,OKAY,
9348,UM WELL IT'S JUST LIKE ANY OTHER LIGHT BULB UH THE FILAMENT WOULD BREAK,ST LIKE NTE OTHER I
9349,HELLO NO YEAH,HPNO
9350,SO IT WOULD COME OUT HERE AND THEN GO THROUGH HERE AND THEN COME HERE AND THEN COME THROUGH HERE EXCEPT THERE PROBABLY WOULDN'T BE ENOUGH LEFT AFTER IT WENT THROUGH OVER HERE,HY WN BE
9351,UM THEY ALL STOPPED,THEYSTOK
9352,THOSE LIGHTS ARE BRIGHT E THEY'RE BRIGHTER THAN THE SERIES AND I THINK IT'S BECAUSE THEY DON'T TAKE EACH OTHER'S ELECTRICITY,THOS E ARTHINK BECATHY N'T IK THERCTO
9353,YEP,P
9354,SURE,
9355,THE BULB WOULD JUST STAY LIGHT,THEBRAST SATE
9356,THE NO,
9357,IT HAD WAY TOO MUCH ELECTRICITY AND THEN AND THEN WHEN YOU REACHED THREE IT'LL JUST BLOW UP THE LIGHT BULB,AE  MCH OYHEN  REACH THREE
9358,AND IT NEVER IT NEVER REALLY ACTUALLY ATTACHES WIRES TO THE OTHER LIGHT BULB,EVER RALL ACTL ASED   TO THE HER
9359,WELL IT WOULD CREATE THE ELECTRICITY TO GO STRAIGHT THROUGH,O TO   STREET THR
9360,WELL THE LIGHTS AT FIRST THEY WOULD GO ON THEN WHEN A FILAMENT WOULD BREAK IT WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO ALL OPEN,W GO ONNNA FMEN WE ABL T OPN
9361,AND THEN THIS ONE WOULD TAKE SOME OF THE ELECTRICITY AND THEN GO LIKE THIS,S ONE WILD TAKE SOME TILECTOOYKEH
9362,YEAH OUR TEACHER TOLD US TO DO THAT BUT WE DIDN'T REALLY GET THE WHOLE THING I YEAH HOW DO WE WER THE PEOPLE THAT WERE MAKING A PARALLEL DIDN'T KNOW EXACTLY HOW TO DO THAT,TOD TON'T RALLY G TH PEOPLE MAKING  PAR A
9363,AFTERNOON,B
9364,UM WELL OF COURSE THE LIGHT BULB IS PROBABLY LIGHTING UP MOST LIKELY OF COURSE AND WELL,IAL IS POBOBLY AINGMOT IK
9365,YEAH I THINK IT WOULD BE LIKE MAYBE ONE CIRCUIT AND THEN THE OTHER CIRCUIT BUT,I THINK WILL B MB  CIRCU ITHE OTHER CIRCUSE
9366,YEAH,
9367,YEAH,SA
9368,AND THEN GO BACK INTO THE LIGHT BULB TO MAKE IT GO OUT,GO BACK N T THE LIPER TOMKGOT
9369,CAUSE THEY NEVER TOUCH,S HA EVER
9370,ELECTRICITY,ERCUSY
9371,BECAUSE IT'S AN OPEN CIRCUIT AND UM IT'S NOT ATTACHING T WELL IT'S NOT METAL TO METAL IN,BECAU AN OPEN CIREMEO
9372,UM NO THAT'S A SERIES,ORS
9373,CIRCUIT YEP,CIGEST
9374,YEAH THAT ONE LOOKS RIGHT,AE
9375,YES MMM HMM,GES
9376,OKAY,
9377,I,TO BIG
9378,YEAH,
9379,UM THERE'S JUST NOT ENOUGH ELECTRICITY TO CREATE UH ENOUGH FOR TWO,EC TO RATERTUNTE
9380,WELL WHEN YOU HAVE A LIGHT BULB LIKE THIS ONE I GUESS IT WOULD BE LI UM THE LIGHT BULB WOULD,WEN YOU HASE A LIG LIKE TMON G W BTHEIGB
9381,THAT'S IS S S THE BATTERY D CELL,THATBAE
9382,WELL OKAY SO THIS WOULD BE THE PA THIS WOULD BE THE POSITIVE SIDE AND THEN SO IT WOULD GO THROUGH AND THEN INTO THE LIGHT BULB AND THEN OUT BACK,HBOTHN ENTERED THE A
9383,YEAH,
9384,IT'S ALL STOPPING AND STAYING,TOP
9385,YEAH WELL IT WOULD PROBABLY BE BRIGHTER OR THE SAME BECAUSE IT'S IT'S OWN LITTLE CIRCUIT SO IT WOULDN'T REALLY,THE SMEBECUS  AIRCE
9386,THAT'D PROBABLY BE A PARALLEL MINE ARE THAT WAY TOO,THA BE A  TAT
9387,YEAH UM ALMOST TEN,OMOST
9388,THESE AREN'T WORKING,NG
9389,BECAUSE WHEN YOU PRESS IT DOWN METAL TO METAL IT JUST GOES STRAIGHT THROUGH ALL THE WAY TO THE LIGHT BULB,WHN YOU PEMEDO TMS STREET THRH TOI
9390,I DON'T KNOW,
9391,WELL WE WANT TO MAKE A PARALLEL CIRCUIT,WIWE WN'T TO MAK A PARLIE SIRCUS
9392,YEAH,
9393,EXCEPT WHEN WE TRIED UM PUTTING TWO D CELLS TOGETHER UM POSITIVE SIDE TO POSITIVE OR NEGATIVE SIDE JUST PUTTING THEM TOGETHER,WEN WE TRDER TO GATHERANPOTVSJS PUIGTHEM TGATHER
9394,THAT WOULD PROBABLY I DON'T KNOW WELL,TOM
9395,YEAH,
9396,YEAH,
9397,NO BUT WE THOUGHT ABOUT IT AND THEN WE DECIDED TO AND THEY PROBABLY ARE DOING IT RIGHT NOW,E THOUGHT ABOUTT DSIED TO AR

9409,YEAH,
9410,YEAH,
9411,HE GOES TO FRONT RANGE IN FORT COLLINS,HE AS T FROM AHINFOAM
9412,I WOULD TELL HERE THAT THE LIGHTS DID NOT BURN OUT IT'S JUST ONE OF THEM BURNED OUT AND CREATED AN OPEN CIRCUIT TO MAKE IT AS THE ELECTRICITY WOULDN'T FLOW THROUGH,HTOT BRTH BIREDONED AN OPENTHE'
9413,UM YOU WOULD HAVE A BATTERY,UT HAV AB
9414,UM IT GOT BRIGHTER I THINK IT EVEN GO BRIGHTER THAN THE PARALLEL CIRCUIT,THNK A PRAER TH PAIRC

9418,MMM YEAH,
9419,WELL WHEN YOU HAVE,WENYOU HAVE
9420,YEAH HE COMES TO TOWN EVERY WEEKEND,CUMSON EVERY W
9421,YES IN THE SERIES CIRCUIT THAT I MADE WE HAD VERY DULL LIGHT BULBS SO,A ING TA SEI CIRCUS  E HD  E
9422,NORMALLY ON A SERIES I THINK I DON'T KNOW EITHER,MARMAN A I THINK
9423,MMM HMM UM THE LIGHT BULB DOESN'T LIGHT UP,TIEL DOES N'T LATE O
9424,YEAH,
9425,UM THE MORE WRAPS YOU YOU DO AROUND THE RIVET MAKES IT SO THAT IT'S STRONGER AND MAYBE IT KEEPS LIKE A LOT OF ENERGY GOING THROUGH IT THE MORE WRAPS,THEATHMKS STANGERIKE ALOGHTOF ENARYGOIN THRH AP

9446,WELL SINCE WE DID TEN WRAPS AND IT ONLY PICKED UP TWO IT'D BE LIKE,N E APS ONLY PIC UP TOE
9447,UM YES BECAUSE IT WAS WRAPPED AROUND IN A IN A WIRE AND IT WAS KINDA LIKE A S A LONG STICK,BECASE HE WAS RAPT RONWRG STAK
9448,UM THAT A MAGNET IS ACTUALLY MADE TO PICK THEM UP AND THEN WHEN YOU HAVE AN ELECTROMAGNET YOU HAVE TO DO STUFF TO IT TO MAKE IT PICK STUFF UP,HNT ATTWHEN YOU HAV AT
9449,UM I THINK WE'RE GONNA USE LIKE EVERYTHING THAT WE'VE DONE ALREADY AND TO MAKE IT BECAUSE UM IT CAUSE ALL THE TIME IT JUST LEADS UP TO SOMETHING BIGGER,I THINK AK VERY THINGWEVLAAH TIMEEAE P TO SOM THNBIGR
9450,YEAH,
9451,HE MADE UM A ROBOT THAT UM DOES MAGIC TRICKS,HE AHE  ROBMT
9452,AND IT WOULD PROBABLY BE NOT EVEN,WIL PROBY B NOT EVEN
9453,UM I THINK IT SEEMED WEAKER UM WHEN WE USED ONE BATTERY BUT WHEN WE USED TWO IT MADE IT BIGGER,THERN TO
9454,YEAH THAT SURPRISED ME FROM THE GAP BETWEEN TEN AND FORTY FIVE YEAH AND WE DID IT THIRTY TIMES AND THAT ONLY GOT US SEVEN SO THAT MAKES REALLY WEIRD SENSE,HIE FR BETWEEN TENN FIRT FIVETHRTY TME ONY SEVEN SEN
9455,NO WE DIDN'T HAVE A SWITCH,NWE DN'TA
9456,OF WASHERS,RAURES
9457,A LINE POINT GRAPH A LINE POINT GRAPH,GINGPN
9458,UM BECAUSE I THOUGHT IT WOULD PICK UP AT LEAST HALF OF IT'S NUMBER LIKE FIVE EXCEPT IT JUST PICKED UP TWO SO IT'S,BECAUSE I THOGHT E WN HEEFEP T
9459,THE ONLY THING THAT I CAN THINK OF IS LIKE UM UH UH UH AT UH A JUNKYARD WHERE UM THEY PICK UP LIKE THE CARS AND THE METAL THINGS WITH THE BIG MAGNET,THINK LKEKEA CAMEDO THINGS WITH BIG T
9460,UM WE HAD IT HOOKED UP TO A BATTERY,I
9461,UM I DON'T KNOW BECAUSE WE WE ONLY PRACTICE WITH WASHERS BUT A MAGNET DID PICK THOSE UP SO,N'T NOBECAUSE ONLY PAGCTUS WITH WARPI TS
9462,AND THEN TEN TWENTY THIRTY FORTY IT ACTUALLY DID GO UP TO FIFTY SO,T   WENTYHRTCLY IDN'T G  O FIFTY S
9463,UM WRAPS,BRATH
9464,MMM HMM YEAH,S
9465,UM WE HAD A WIRE CONNECTED TO THE BATTERY THAT WAS WRAPPED AROUND THE RIVET UM AND THEN THE OTHER SIDE WENT BACK ONTO THE OTHER SIDE OF THE WIRE WENT BACK ONTO THE WIRE BATTERY,E HAD A WER CONECTED TO THE BATER RAPON THETHE OTHER SDNT BTH OTHR SIDETHE ERB
9466,UM WE STARTED MAKING LIGHT BULBS LIGHT WITH A BATTERY THEN WE WENT INTO MOTORS AND THEN WE MADE CIRCUITS AND THEN WE JUST STARTED,WE STARTED MAKING IBELS LIGHT WITH A BATH TAMD IRWEVEJUST STARTED
9467,AND OF COURSE THIS WRAP INCREASED KIND OF MORE THAN WHAT WE DID BECAUSE IT WAS TEN AND TEN AND TEN AND THEN THIS ONE DID FIFTEEN,THNCNDHBECAS W FIFT
9468,UM IT'S WHEN YOU HAVE A WIRE AND AN IRON LIKE STICK SORT OF THING,WEN YO HAVE A ER  N IRSTIC SRTOF THINK
9469,WE READ ABOUT HE STOPPED UM,REDBO
9470,NEXT WEDNESDAY,XWNY
9471,THE GRAPH YEAH IT WAS KINDA BUILT IN LIKE THIS AND THEN IT HAD TEN TWENTY THIRTY FORTY AND,TGAS CN BIELLDN LIKE TH HAD TENWENTY HIRTY FRTY N
9472,UM HE USED HIS WATCH MAKING SKILLS AND HIS MAGICIAN SKILLS,ED HIS WATCH MAKING SCALLS HMSIONSCS
9473,STRONGER,STRANGER
9474,YEAH WE TRIED IT WITH TEN WRAPS AND THAT US TWO WASHERS,WE HADW TRYD OT WITHPS IN THT GU TO WAERS
9475,UM NOT EXACTLY BUT WHEN WE HOOKED THE THE LAST WIRE UP TO THE BATTERY IT WOULD WORK,ONT EGSAN EK LAST WER TE
9476,YEAH BUT IT DEPENDS ON THE M MAGNET SIZE OF COURSE AND THE RIVET SIZE,B PENDS ON  E MASCINTH IBS
9477,THAT'S REALLY WEIRD,RELI
9478,WRAP IT WITH WIRES AND CONNECT IT TO BATTERIES AND,AP WITH WARS IN COUECT TOA
9479,THAT'D BE LIKE THE FIRST LINE,LIKE TH FIRST
9480,TODAY WE MADE AN ELECTROMAGNET YEAH,WMEAGHE AN ELEC MAMNT
9481,UM THAT THE BEGINNING IT STARTED OFF REALLY SMALL AND THEN IT GOT BIGGER AND THEN HUGER,BENN STARTED VEY SMOLL N BIGER N HUER
9482,IT LOOKED LIKE LIKE,GLIE
9483,YEAH,
9484,THEY BOTH PICK UP IRON THINGS,MABEL PICK U AIRN THANGS
9485,UM WHAT SURPRISED ME WAS THAT TEN WRAPS WOULD PICK UP ONLY TWO,P ME  THEAP  TWO
9486,UM YEAH I THINK HE USED AN ELECTROMAGNET BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT WHAT WE READ BEFORE WE DID THE ELECTROMAGNET SO IT'S PROBABLY WHAT HE USED,THINKE REDBFRA
9487,WRAPS,AT
9488,WELL BECAU WE HAD A THOUSAND TEN BUT WE ALSO HAD THIS UM CUP THAT WAS A HUNDRED SO WE USED THAT TOO SO I SORTA YOU KNOW,WE HAD A TH E ALSO HADTE A HONDRE
9489,YEAH BECAUSE YOU KNOW IT'S A HUNDRED SO YOU KNOW IT'S GONNA BE RIGHT THERE BUT YOU'D HAVE TO DO IT TEN TIMES SO YEAH,BECAUS YOU NOTES A HONDERS CNBER A T TEN TIMES

10742,O THE THE PLASTIC DISK WEIGHS SOME AND THE METAL DISK WEIGHS SOME,H ME
10743,THAT WASN'T EVEN THE ANSWER THE ANSWER WAS THREE AND IT'S ABOUT USING PAPER CLIPS TO MEASURE IT AGAINST THE POKER CHIP,THAT VAE PAPERETOANANARHP
10744,USE THE SAME SIZE PAPER CLIP,THE SAME  PAPER
10745,PAPER CLIPS,APERGLATS

10759,METAL'S HEAVIER OF COURSE AND THE PLASTIC CHIP,METOES HAVE AR  LHIP
10760,M I SAID THAT IF YOU USE THE SAME SIZE PAPER CLIPS IT WON'T AFFECT ANYTHING BECAUSE THEY'RE ALL THE SAME SIZE SO THAT WON'T DO ANYTHING TO THE RESULTS,AERTECT Y THINGBECUSRA THE SAME  THING T THE RESOLT
10761,GROUP TWO HAS LOWER NUMBERS BECAUSE THEY HAD THE BIGGER PAPER CLIPS AND GROUP ONE HAS BIGGER NUMBERS BECAUSE THEY HAD THE SMALLER PAPER CLIPS,GR HAS RBIGRRCASR
10762,IT'S NOT ACCURATE BECAUSE PAPER CLIPS CAN BE DIFFERENT SIZES AND DIFFERENT WEIGHTS,CUS P CAN  RNTSID IN DRNT WAES

11286,SO FROM THE WIRE IT MOVES UP TO THE LIGHT BULB FROM THE WIRE AND THEN IT'LL COME BACK UP AND IT'LL GO LIKE TO THE PLUS SIDE,FROM THE ER P TO THE LITEBOAT FROM THE ERM I
11287,THAT THE ENERGY IS ALWAYS GOING FROM INTO THE LIGHT BULB AND THEN OUT TO THE LIGHT BULB AND OUT OF THE LIGHT BULB INTO THE POSITIVE SIDE,TH ENRS AAYS GON FROM INOTEOSTV
11288,SO FROM THE NEGATIVE SIDE IT IS FLOWING TOWARDS THE LIGHT BULB AND THEN IT WILL FROM THE LIGHT BULB GO TO THE POSITIVE SIDE,FROM THE NEIVSD FLOWING TOR THE O FROM THE LAEO TO THE OS
11289,THAT THE ENERGY IS MOVING FROM THE D CELL BATTERY TO THE LIGHT AND THEN BACK TO TO THE D CELL BATTERY,TH EN MOVING FROM THE DEAER TO THE LT BK T T

11608,ONE BIG PAPER CLIP AND ONE SMALL PAPER CLIP,BIGPAPERCT INPPER
11609,OKAY,
11610,BECAUSE UM WHEN LIKE ANIMALS DIE THEY'RE THEY'RE JUST THEIR BONES SO THEN THEY EAT ALL OF THAT TO BREAK THE BONES DOWN,ECT LIKE AMLES THEB THEBO DWN
11611,IT'S BECAUSE IT'S LIKE THE ONLY FOOD THEY EAT CAUSE JUST SOME PEOPLE JUST ARE LIKE KINDA LIKE A VEGETARIAN SO THEY JUST EAT LIKE YOU KNOW,LIKENYAT SOME PEOPLEDTA
11612,I DON'T KNOW HOW TO SPEAK BUT KINDA LIKE A VEGETARIAN,IDON'T NO HOWTO SPEK IKEG
11613,I THINK THEY GET THEIR ENERGY FROM WHEN THEY EAT BONES AND BREAK THEM DOWN,I THINK THE GET  ENARGY FROMTH  RA THM DOWN
11614,THEY ATE ALL THAT PAPER AND LEAVE AND WHEN ONCE THEY POOPED IT OUT IT TURNED INTO SOIL,THAHH PAERTUR T SER
11615,I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE WORD IS BUT I THINK IT'S ANOTHER WORD TO DESCRIBE IT IS LIKE VEGETARIAN,I' NWEORVES LIKE VEGETAON
11616,I THINK IT JUST A CONSUMER IS ALL KIND OF ALL ABOUT EATING TO SURVIVE,I THINK  CIAING TO SRE
11617,SO WE HAVE A HEALTHIER PLANET,SWEE HPL
11618,I BEEN LEARNING ABOUT THE FOOD WEB PRODUCERS UM DECOMPOSER AND CONSUMERS,IVEN LEARING ABOUT THECPSIE IN CONCUMOR
11619,IT'S A DECOMPOSER,SDCMPOSER
11620,A BEAR WHAT IT MEANS TO ME IT IS AN OMNIVORE,MES TOMES AN ALRVE
11621,IT EATS LIKE UM SNOW WHITE RABBITS AND THAT WHITE COUNT LOOK LIKE A HAMSTER,EATS OWIT RABOTS IN THAT  LO LIK HAMSTAR
11622,I THINK IT'S KINDA LIKE A VEGETARIAN FOR SOME PEOPLE,I THINK  CA FR SOME PEOPLE
11623,MAKES THEM A DECOMPOSER,MAK SOMDCOMPOTSER
11624,SO THEY AREN'T ALL THE SAME LIKE SOME ARE VEGETARIAN AND SOME ARE MEAT EATERS,THE ARE ALL SAME LIKE SOME  VEETAON IN SOME AR
11625,IT TELLS ME NOT LIKE US HUMANS OR CARNIVORE OR HERBIVORES THEY DON'T EAT THAT KIND OF STUFF ONLY DECOMPOSER EAT THAT KIND OF STUFF,MOT K AHUMTPER
11626,A PLANT LIKE GROWS IT'S OWN FOOD THROUGH PHOTOSYNTHESIS KINDA LIKE A CYCLE OR ECOSYSTEM AND IT'S KINDA LIKE AN EVOLUTION,ATRTHRE   IEOTMAND CALTION
11627,IT'S KINDA LIKE WHEN WE RECYCLE AND THROW AWAY TRASH,IKE WHEN WE SIC NTHROWA
11628,I THINK IT WHAT IT HAS TO DO IS LIKE UM,I THINKWT HA IE
11629,ANIMALS GET THEIR ENERGY FROM THE PRODUCERS FROM LIKE EATING AND DRINKING AND KINDA LIKE ENERGY FROM THE SUN LIKE JUST LIKE PRODUCERS MAYBE,ANMLSEARGY FRO THE  FO EATING RC EY FROM THE SIU
11630,IT'S BECAUSE THEY DON'T EAT ANYTHING AND THEY JUST MAKE THEIR OWN FOOD SO LIKE THE CONSUMERS COULD EAT THEM,CAHAT  TNG  USTM THER
11631,THEY EAT IT ALL AND THEN ONCE THEY POOP IT OUT IT TURNS INTO SOIL,THEY EATA  WTN O
11632,A CARNIVORE IS LIKE THE LION AND THE POLAR BEAR THEY ONLY EAT MEAT,A  LIKE  I I
11633,I THINK THEY EAT UM EAT GRASS WHICH IS ON THE RIGHT OF THE TOP FRONT PICTURE,I THINK TH C S H RI THE PIER
11634,A WORMS ARE UM THEY ARE A DECOMPOSER WHICH THEY BREAK DOWN STUFF LIKE UM THOSE THE D THING,TH WARM ATHECERCH TH AE DOTE
11635,I THINK THEY EAT KINDA LIKE TRASH AND BROKEN DOWN BONES AND MOSTLY AND THEN THEY TURN THAT INTO SOIL,I THINK THE EA IE ASH  BOKEN DWNM TRNTH
11636,THAT MAKES IT A HERBIVORE BECAUSE IT ONLY EATS MEAT,THAT MAK HEROBECAUS
11637,I THINK IT BREAKS STUFF DOWN,I THINK ATO
11638,IT IS AN OMNIVORE JUST LIKE US HUMANS IT EATS MEAT AND PLANT,VOO IKE HMPLA
11639,A PRODUCER GOES THROUGH IT'S PHOTOSYNTHESIS IT MAKES IT'S OWN FOOD IT DOESN'T EAT ANYTHING,ERNG
11640,CONSUMER IS LIKE WHAT IT EATS AND LIKE WHAT THEIR ENEMIES EAT THEM,NUMEAR IKET  LICE WTHE EMS
11641,I THINK IS WHAT EATS WHAT,I THINK
11642,THEY BREAK DOWN SO IT COULD TURN INTO ORGANIC OR SOIL,THBTRT
11643,LIKE HUMANS AND BEARS THEY EAT MEAT AND PLANTS,LIKE MONS A TH  MT AND PLANT
11644,GOOD,
11645,I NOTICE ALL THE TRASH AND LEAVES HAVE BEEN SHORTENED THAT MEANS IT TOOK IT DAYS OR WEEKS OR MAYBE YEARS,IN NOT THE ASON LEES HAV  SRTIT  MAB
11646,THEY EAT LIKE ALL KINDS OF TRASH AND WHAT THEY RETURN IS THEY RETURN NUTRIENTS TO THE EARTH,THEY EAT LKEAS NT RN MON TO THE ART
11647,THAT MEANS IT'S AN OMNIVORE,THAT MEN I AN OL
11648,WHAT IS HAS TO BE IT'S KINDA LIKE UM UM KILLING OTHERS LIKE THIS BEAR IS EATING A FISH AND PROBABLY THE RED TAILED HAWK EATS LIKE RABBITS AND BIRDS,WTACING ATHERS LIKE LIKE PEI EATING FHINER B
11649,THERE'S HERBIVORE OMNIVORE CARNIVORE AND I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE LAST ONE IS,THE EDN'T NOW LAST WD
11650,I THINK WHAT IT MEANS TO BE AN OMNIVORE LIKE HUMANS AND BLACK BEARS EAT MEAT AND PLANTS,I THINK  MEANS T BE HUMONS IN BLCBERANDPLANTES
11651,THEY BREAK DOWN DECAYING AND DECAYING MATTER AND THEY TURN IT INTO SOIL,THE  DAMEAME MAER INA TUR
11652,THAT TELLS ME IT HAS TO RETURN SOMETHING TO THE EARTH BECAUSE THEY ATE SOMETHING THAT MEANS THAT UM THEY RETURNED NUTRIENTS TO THE EARTH,THTMATRN SMTHEN TOTHHBECSTHEMUN TO THE ART
11653,IT IS A CONSUMER,OCUMOR
11654,THIS IS ALL ABOUT WHAT ANIMALS AND FUNGI AND BACTERIA EAT,THALL BOUT  ANMLES I
11655,MEANS TO BE A CARNIVORE IS LIKE LIONS AND POLAR BEARS ONLY EAT MEAT THAT'S WHAT A CARNIVORE IS,TEA A LIKE INS INT
11656,GOOD,GOOD
11657,THEY GO THROUGH THEIR OWN PHOTOSYFESIS TO MAKE THEIR OWN FOOD,TH GO THRO THER NOTS TOMAK THERT
11658,WHAT MAKES A PLANT A PRODUCER IS BECAUSE IT MAKES IT'S OWN THROUGH PHOTOSYNFESIS UM FROM SUNSHINE AND WATER,T MAKE  ERBECUE TH FROM SNI WATER
11659,IT ONLY EATS PLANTS THAT MEANS IT'S A HERBIVORE,I ONL EATS PLANS THT MEAS I A HERB
11660,A PRODUCER MAKES IT'S OWN FOOD AND IT GETS SUNSHINE AND WATER TO MAKES IT'S OWN PHOTOSYNFESIS AND MAKES IT'S OWN FOOD,THAT PRDUSER MS N WATER
11661,AND HERBIVORE MEANS LIKE LIKE ELK OR DEER OR BUNNIES ONLY EAT PLANT,N INS T PLANS
11662,THE BEAR IS AN OMNIVORE BECAUSE IT EATS MEAT AND PLANTS,THE BAR IS AN AVLBECAUSMA IN PLANTS
11663,THEY GET IT FROM DECAYNAH AND DECAHNUH ORGAN ORGANIC MATTER,THEY GET FROM TAO NMATER
11664,GET THEIR ENERGY FROM EATING OTHER THEY CAN'T THEY CAN'T EAT THEMSELVES BECAUSE AND THEY CAN'T MAKE THEIR OWN FOOD SO THAT'S WHY THEY HAVE TO EAT THE OTHER ANIMALS AND THEY EAT PRODUCERS,E FROM EATINGESVES BCKE THES WTHEA OTHER ANAMLES U
11665,IT'S NOT A PRODUCER OR A CONSUMER IT'S A DECOMPOSER,INUMERICMPSER
11666,THEY EAT IT ALL AND THEN THEY TURN IT INTO SOIL THAT'S WHY THEY ARE A DECOMPOSER,THE EA G THEM A TURNCPSER
11667,I THINK THAT PRODUCERS ARE THE GRASS AND THE PINECONE,I THINK THUCR ARE IN THE PINCA
11668,WHAT IT'S ALL ABOUT BECAUSE IT BREAKS DOWN HERE OR DIGGING UM ALL ORGANISTS OF MATTER,WS ALL BOT BECAUS T RI WATER
11669,NO THEY ARE NOT,OT
11670,I THINK WHY IT'S SO IMPORTANT IS JUST BECAUSE UM THEY RETURN NUTRIENTS AND WE NUTRIENTS IN OUR BODY,I THINKSO IPOR UST BECR NU ANDS IN NU UNDI
11671,I THINK WHAT'S TO BE A CONSUMER IS UM TO UM EAT OTHER THINGS THEY'RE NOT THEY DON'T THEY CAN'T MAKE THEIR OWN FOOD THEY HAVE TO EAT OTHER THINGS TO GET THEIR ENERGY,I THINK AN LLBE A UMERTHE THEA OER THNT HEEGY
11672,WHEN THEY RETURN NUTRIENTS TO THE WORLD LIKE WE KINDA RETURN NUTRIENTS TO THE CAUSE WE NEED NUTRIENTS IN OUR BODY,WHEN THEY TRN N TTHE C TANS INBAU
11673,I THINK WHAT IT MEANS TO BE A DECOMPOSER THAT IT MEANS IT EATS IT AND THEN IT UM RETURNS NUTRIENTS TO THE EARTH,I THNKMNE TBCOPETEN NEW ANS TO THE EARTH
11674,BECAUSE THEY BREAK DOWN BONES AND ALSO THEY CAN TURN IT INTO SOMETHING NEW LIKE SOIL JUST LIKE WORMS,BECAUSE THE AG   SOMTHIN T
11675,THE DECOMPOSERS ARE MUSHROOM OR FUNGI AND BACTERIA,THE DE COMPOASERE AR MATE
11676,I BEEN LEARNING ABOUT THE FOOD WEB ALSO PRODUCERS DECOMPOSERS AND CONSUMERS,ENNGBTAOCPR IN CUMOR
11677,IT'S A DECOMPOSER IT EATS DECAYING AND DECAYING MATTER AND RETURNS NUTRIENTS TO THE EARTH,COPSERA MATER IN RE TRN NEW AS TO THE AT
11678,I THINK WHAT THE LUNGS DO IS THAT UM THEY GIVE US OXYGEN AND THE MAIN ORGAN FOR BREATHING IS IN HUMANS AND SO THAT'S WHAT I THINK ABOUT LUNG,I THINK TNGVE AOROORONFNGHTHIN
11679,THEY UH BRING IN OXYGEN WITH EXCHANGE OF THE CARBON DIOXIDE,RNG NO WITH ETANGE OF HE RM EO
11680,WHAT THE LUNGS DO IS THAT ONCE WE BREATHE IN IT GETS KIND OF FATTER AND BIGGER AND ONCE WE GO OUT IT GETS SMALLER,TH NGI THAT ENWE BTHE EERHESWE BREATHE S MALAR
11681,THAT UM IT'S GOING THROUGH AND THROUGH LIKE I SEE LIKE SOME CIRCULAR THINGS AND IT'S GOING BY FROM THE HEART AND THE CAPILLARY AND OTHERS,THATN THRIN THRO LIKEOME CIRCER THINGS INFROMTHE C THER
11682,HOW THEY INHALE AND EXHALE IS INHALE IS LIKE ONCE YOU BREATHE IN FROM THE NOSE WHICH IS THE FILTER AND THEN EXHALE IS WHEN YOU BREATHE OUT,HTHE HA LIK ENH RT FROM THE NO W WHEN YOU RATHU
11683,I THINK WHAT IT'S ALL ABOUT IS THAT IT'S SHOWING HOW UM WHERE AIR GOES IN AND CARBON DIOXIDE GOES OUT IN AND OUT OF YOUR MOUTH OR YOUR NOSE,I THINK WTIS ALBOUTIS HWING HAR GOWS IN AMMTHYOUR NOS
11684,WHAT THE RESPIRATORY SYSTEM DOES IS LIKE IT HELPS YOU BREATHE LIKE WHEN IT IT GOES IN AND OUT OF YOUR LUNGS WHEN OXYGEN GOES IN AND CARBON DIOXIDE GOES OUT,THE TOT K EPGO IN V EO OS I
11685,I SEE LITTLE CIRCLES LIKE IT'S GETTING PASSED THROUGH LIKE A SYSTEM LIKE THE CARBON DIOXIDE IS GOING OUT AND OXYGEN IS GOING IN,IRCLE LIKEING PATR IKE A ITM LIKE A  GN OUT IN
11686,DOING GOOD,ENGOD
11687,THEY'RE RESPONSIBLE FOR I THINK WHEN CARBON OXYGEN GOES IN AND THEY'RE RESPONSIBLE FOR CARBON DIOXIDE TO GO OUT,THEREPAONTABLE FORI THINKENOO H
11688,WHAT THE EXCHANGE OF GASES IS ALL ABOUT IS WE SURVIVE WITH OXYGEN WE CAN'T SURVIVE WITH CARBON DIOXIDE CAUSE THAT'S KIND OF A POISON OXYGEN TO US,THETANG LERVE WITHONWCN SERIVE WITH NION TO US
11689,FIRST OF ALL WE NEED TO SURVIVE SECOND OF ALL UM IT'S OUR ONLY WAY OF LIFE TO BREATHE,F THE O EAD  ERVE NLYE TOBREATHE
11690,THAT WOULD PROBABLY BE OXYGEN,TA WIALPOBLY EOSSION
11691,THE GAS EXCHANGE IS FROM THOSE ALVEOLI AND UM THAT'S WHERE UM WHERE THE OXYGEN GOES IN AND THE CARBON DIOXIDE GOES OUT,A A FROM THEIWSONOWS  IN THE CAR
11692,I THINK IT IS E FOR LUNGS,I THINK IS AF
11693,I THINK THEIR BEHAVIOR IS SAFETY BECAUSE THEY DON'T WANT TO BE EATEN WHEN THEY ARE FLYING HIGH IN THE AIR,I THINK THEVEERSAFTY BECAUSENGHIN THE AR
11694,I'M DOING GOOD,I'MING GOD
11695,THIS IS A NON LEARNED BEHAVIOR BECAUSE THEY'RE HATCHING FROM THEIR EGG AND THEY'RE THEY'RE ALREADY CRAWLING OUT TO SEA,THIS S A O BEHAVER BECAUSE T AT FROMEDY OLING
11696,THE STIMULUS IS BECAUSE THE SKUNK OR THE COYOTE HAS AN ADAPTATION THE SKUNK HAS A,TM BECETHY HASATION
11697,SO I THINK WHY SO IT COULD SWIM AND LIKE IT COULD LIKE IT COULD LIKE PUSH IT IN CASE IF LIKE ONE OF IT'S DUCKLINGS LIKE COMES FALLING BEHIND,S THINKCALIKE UMSFONBEHIND
11698,HE WOULD PROBABLY ATTACK FOR IT OR JUST RUN AWAY,HE WAL PO TAK O JUST RNEWA
11699,THAT THE RATTLESNAKE IS RATTLING IT'S TAIL TO SAY GO AWAY FROM ME OR ELSE I'LL BITE,THARAD SNAK IS TWAY FROM E
11700,IT'S TELLING THE PERSON LIKE ONCE A SNAKE'S TAIL IT RATTLES THEN IT'S ABOUT TO ATTACK THE PERSON,TINGTH PERSON LIKE SAKAH ABOUT TO ATK TH PERSON
11701,NO,NOWE
11702,LIKE THE REACTIONS OF PEOPLE AND ANIMALS,LIKE THREACTIONS OF PEOPLE IN AMALE
11703,I THINK IT'S MIGRATE BEHAVIOR CAUSE THEY'RE LIKE NOT GETTING EATEN,I THINK  MYBHAVERC
11704,THAT THEY WANTED TO PROTECT THEMSELVES FROM OTHER PREDATORS,THATTHEY WONTED TOTECT THEM SOLVES FROM OTHER CRAARS
11705,LIKE THE FLIPPERS HELP EM KIND OF LIKE FEET TO SWIM AND ALSO THE BEAK FOR LIKE TO EAT LIKE FISH OR SOMETHING FOR LIKE ITS FOOD OR SOMETHING,THELP SWAM SOMTN
11706,IT'S A NOT LEARNED BEHAVIOR,OTRD BEHAVER
11707,THAT IT COULD SHOOT A BAD SMELL OUT OF ITS TAIL,TI CAN T THE BESMELE OTEVTAE
11708,A CAT IS FALLING FROM A TREE,A CA IS FOWING FROM THE TREE
11709,IT'S PRETTY MUCH MARKING ITS TERRITORY SO PREDATORS CAN'T EAT IT AND ALSO HOW ONE WAY THEY COULD DEFEND THEMSELVES,R MCH ERTOAURYAOREH FEN THEMSELE
11710,I THINK IT'S A LEARNING BEHAVIOR BECAUSE YOU ARE LEARNING HOW TO WRITE YOUR NAME,I THINK  ARING BEHAVER BECAS YOUR LRIR
11711,THAT HE'S TELLING THE PERSON TO GO AWAY OR ELSE I'LL BITE YOU BECAUSE HE'S TRYING TO DEFEND HIMSELF FROM PREDATORS LIKE HUMANS,THATTELING T PERSON TWBECAUSEM TRY T DFENFROM ETRE HUO
11712,THAT THE SKUNKS TAIL IS ONE OF THE ADAPTATIONS BECAUSE IT SHOOTS THE SMELL OUT OF IT,M T IS TH EGTATIONC
11713,THAT THEY ALL HAVE DIFFERENT REACTIONS ON DIFFERENT THINGS,THHV RNT REACTIONS ON DIRENT THINGS
11714,BECAUSE USUALLY ANIMALS ARE SCARED OF BRIGHT COLORS OR PREDATORS ARE SCARED OF BRIGHT COLORS,CA U ANAMLES AR SCARED OF  CRE SCARE OF CLAR
11715,LIKE IT'S KIND OF LIKE THE SAME COLOR AS THE GROUND AND ALSO THE TURTLE CAN ACTUALLY HIDE IN ITS SHELL AND ALSO IT CAN COME IN SO NO PREDATORS CAN GET IT,IKE THE SMETEEATCACTLYNE
11716,THAT MEANS WHAT THE REACTION PART IS I WOULD PROBABLY JUST GO AWAY FROM IT,THAT MENACI WAFROM
11717,I THINK IT'S A MIGRATION BEHAVIOR BECAUSE THE BLACK THING IS STUCK ON THE HUMAN'S KNEE,I THINK BEHAVERCSB THING S S ONUM
11718,THAT LIKE THE DOG WANTS TO CATCH THE FRISBEE AND HE IS HAVING FUN AND ALSO THE BIRDS ARE FLYING TOGETHER SO THEY COULD BE SAFE,KTHDOG WNCCH TAHIDATHERAE
11719,IT'S INSTINCTIVE BECAUSE IT'S REACTING CAUSE IT'S FALLING AND HE WANTS TO LAND SAFELY ON THE GROUND,TANGBECAUSE IECSAFEY ON THE GROND
11720,I THINK IT'S KIND OF LIKE LIKE A MIGRATION BEHAVIOR,IG THINK IS CA BEHAVER
11721,I THINK NUMBER TWO THE TEETH BECAUSE THAT'S HOW IT CHEWS THE MEAT,I THINKOETHBCASE E
11722,I THINK IT'S THE WINGS BECAUSE IT HELPS IT FLY AWAY FASTER FROM THE PREDATOR,I THINK S RING BCAMFATER FROM THE
11723,I THINK IT'S SIX BECAUSE THE HOUSES THE LAND THE MOUNTAINS THE SKY THE TREES AND THAT LITTLE UM BLUE GREY BROWN THING,I THINKIX BECAUS TH HOU ISH SYTRE IN TA GRHN
11724,I SEE THE WATER I SEE THE ATMOSPHERE WHICH IS THE SKY I SEE THE MOUNTAINS I SEE SOME TREES AND SOME HOUSES,ATERIAGSVER  IEM TRES IN SOME HOUE
11725,I THINK THE BIOSPHERE IS MADE OUT OF UM PROBABLY TREES AND HUMANS AND ANIMALS PROBABLY JUST TREES PLANTS AND ANIMALS,I THINK THE VE FE MAHE NP  HMON AOBLE JUT PANG A AMLHNK
11726,THE BIOSPHERE IS PROBABLY ALL ABOUT LIFE LIKE TREES PLANTS AND US LIKE HUMANS,THE BUEAR IS POBELY AL ABOUT LI I REAS PLANSANHUMON
11727,GOOD,
11728,I THINK THEY'RE JUST TRYING TO SURVIVE NOT LIKE TO GET EATEN BUT PROBABLY THE MOST DANGEROUS ONES ARE A SNAKE A RED TAILED HAWK,I THINK ARE JUST TRYN TO SAR VE ELMO DANGEROUS WONS ARSK IN THE HAW
11729,WELL PROBABLY MOST ANIMALS GO FOR PROBABLY BACTERIA MUSHROOMS AND UM THE OTHERS JUST GO FOR LIKE PLANTS,MOST ANTMALES  BAC T MHROMSNOTHER JT IE PLATS
11730,I THINK SOME YEAH,I THINK SOME
11731,IT'S KINDA MOSTLY IN THE SAME THING BUT IT'S MOSTLY IN THE WINTER OR LIKE ANTARCTICA OR LIKE WHERE MOUNT EVEREST IS,OST THE SAME THING STIN TH WINTERVE
11732,I THINK IT REPRESENTS THE CLIMATE OR WEATHER OR LIKE THE TEMPERATURE,I THINK I REPRESENTS T CAMA WEATHER  TEMPATUR
11733,WHAT IT NEEDS IS TO SURVIVE IS PROBABLY SOIL WATER AIR AND SUNSHINE,EATE AO ERVE PO WTEIN SANS
11734,THEY DON'T GET THEIR OWN FOOD THEY MAKE THEIR OWN FOOD CAUSE THEY'RE A PRODUCER AND IT MAKES IT'S OWN FOOD THROUGH PHOTOSYNTHESIS,TH DON'T GET KFC
11735,THEY MAKE IT THROUGH THEIR OWN PHOTOSYNTHESIS,T M GO THRO THIR  OT IMS
11736,IT KIND OF LOOKS GREEN BUT IT IT HAS SUNSHINE AND AIR BUT NO WATER SO THAT'S WHY IT'S KIND OF LIKE BENDING,REA SOM THE ARBTWATER
11737,I THINK ALL THOSE CELLS LIKE COMBINE TO MAKE ONE WHOLE LIKE TINY GRAIN OF SAND OF YEAST,I THINK AL ELLS CNE TOAK HINY GREANOF SAN
11738,IT'S LIKE WHAT EATS WHAT AND WHAT EATS THEM,IK
11739,WHEN WATER SUNSHINE AND AIR AND LIKE ALL THOSE COMBINE TOGETHER THE ROOTS GO DOWN INTO THE DIRT AND THEN WHEN WHICH COMES OUT IS LIKE A PLANT,WHEN WATER SON SHIN IN AIKE ALS C NE AHERTH RUS DOWNNT THE D KEA AN
11740,IT'S KIND OF LIKE WHEN YOU GET LIKE A SUNBURN LIKE A HUMAN AND IT'S GETTING ALL YELLOW CAUSE IT HAS NO SUN AND IT'S NOT GETTING ANY GREEN,IKE WEN Y IKA NH YELLOBECAUSE AS N S
11741,DOING GOOD,JI
11742,THEY DO NOT BECAUSE BECAUSE WHEN IT RAINS IN THE SPRING IT GETS WATER AND THEN SUNSHINE AND THEN IT GETS AIR WHEN IT BLOWS,THNOBBCE RINGS IN TH PRINS WATERH
11743,I THINK PLANTS I READ A BOOK ABOUT THIS AND IT PROBABLY NEEDS CARBON DIOXIDE WHICH IS KIND OF IT'S AIR,I THINKA REDA BOOK ABTAT
11744,ACTUALLY NO BECAUSE WHEN I DID MY EXPERIMENT IN THE BAG WE DIDN'T USE ANY WATER AND IT'S AND IT'S STILL GROWING ON ITS OWN,ATBPEMENTTE  WATER TE ROING
11745,YES THEY DO NEED IT,TEATED
11746,YES IT DOES,UG
11747,IT'S BECAUSE THEY WERE ALL SICKLY AND NOT HEALTHY,BECAUSE THEIY
11748,IT WOULDN'T BE A PROBLEM BECAUSE LIKE I JUST SAID IT GOES THROUGH IT'S OWN PHOTOSYNTHESIS WHICH IT MAKES IT'S OWN FOOD IT CAN'T EAT ANYTHING,TAN' BEOBECT
11749,WHEN WE PUT THE PLANTS IN THE BAG IT HAD LIKE A TON OF AIR OR CARBON DIOXIDE IN IT AND THAT'S WHY IT NEEDS TO SURVIVE,WHEN WE PUT  PLANTS IN THEGE T SIE
11750,IT HAS TWO OUT OF THREE BUT NOT THREE OUT OF THREE BECAUSE THEY IT NEEDS WATER AIR AND SUNSHINE IT CAN NOT BE WATER AIR AND NO SUNSHINE,T HAS O THREE BTN THREE OUT THREEBCAUSEH WATEC

11752,BECAUSE IT CAN'T BREATHE ANY CARBON DIOXIDE AND IT'S NOT BREATHING OUT ANY OXYGEN,BECAUECREE E NOT THNOON
11753,I THINK IT'S KIND OF LIKE PLANTS LIKE THEY NEED SUNSHINE AIR AND WATER,I THINK I C PATS LIKE TET SOMESH AR IN WATER
11754,YES IT WOULD BE MISSING THREE THINGS SUN WATER AND AIR,GH WILL E IN THRE HNWATER IN AR
11755,HOW IT RELATES TO ME IS LIKE IT GOES THROUGH IT'S OWN PHOTOSYNTHESIS IT NEEDS SUNSHINE WATER AND AIR FOR IT TO GROW,HO REET TO ME LIKT ONO THR  ONHIN WATER IN AOR
11756,WHERE FOOD WEBS START WILL PROBABLY BE AT THE PRODUCERS BECAUSE PROBABLY MOST CONSUMERS EAT THOSE PRODUCERS,FLOTHWILOLBERUORBCAUS MT CRUER
11757,THEY JUST STAY IN ONE PLACE THEY DON'T MOVE BESIDES THEY MAKE THEIR OWN FOOD THROUGH PHOTOSYNTHESIS WITH THE SUN CARBON DIOXIDE AND WATER,T AETHE DN'TMER T THT ASDE
11758,THINK WHAT IT'S TRYING TO SHOW IS THAT SUNSHINE REFLECTS OFF THE PLANT SO IT CAN,I THINK WT IS TRYING TO SOEIS THA SUM RELCO THE PLA
11759,BECAUSE GRASS AND THE PINE CONE ON THE TREE ARE PRODUCERS AND THE PLANTS ARE PRODUCERS THEY MAKE THEIR OWN FOOD WHICH THE CONSUMERS EAT,BCAUSE RAI THE PNONTHTAR PREUS IN THE PLANT APUUMARET
11760,YES THEY DO NEED IT BECAUSE IT'S KIND OF LIKE WHAT THEY NEED TO BREATHE,A BECAUE  ETHE
11761,WHAT I JUST REALLY THINK IS JUST WHAT EATS WHAT EATS THE PRODUCERS CONSUMERS AND THE DECOMPOSERS,I JUST REALLY THINK IS JSTURCUMINTH DECMPSERS
11762,IT'S BECAUSE IT DOESN'T HAVE ANY WATER,BCAUSIT DOESN'T HAVE Y WATER
11763,I THINK LIGHT WHEN IT REFLECTS SO IT HELPS IT GROW I THINK THE WATER WHEN YOU POUR IT SO IT STAYS HEALTHY AND THE CARBON DIOXIDE WHICH IT BREATHES IN AND OXYGEN IT BREATHES,I THINKTWLRI THINKTHAE THE CA O
11764,I THINK THEY DO BECAUSE SOME ANIMALS EAT THEM AND THAT WILL PROTECT THEM FROM ANIMALS,I THINK TH  BECASESMAMLES THAWTE THEM FROM ANMAL
11765,I THINK WHY IS BECAUSE THERE'S NO WIND AND THERE'S JUST SUNSHINE AND WATER BUT IT HAS TO BE COMPLETE WITH WATER AIR AND SUNSHINE FOR IT TO GROW,I THINKTHE  SSH WATERHASBCOPLETE WITH WATERASMSH RO
11766,IT HAS WATER SUNSHINE BUT NO AIR,IT HAS WATER SOM

11769,LIKE SOME PEOPLE SAY SO IT DOESN'T DAMAGE IT,IK SOME PEOPLE A
11770,SOMETIMES WHEN CONSUMERS ARE EATING THEM THEY'LL HAVE TO PUT FERTILIZER AROUND IT SO THE ANIMALS CAN'T EAT CAUSE IF THEY EAT IT IT'LL KIND OF BE LIKE A GROSS TASTE,OMTIME WEN CUMORTHIHROANMLES EEIA
11771,IT SHOWS LIKE A LIKE A LIKE A SOME KIND OF OF DRINK THAT MAKES IT GROW FOOD,IT HO LIKE I SOME CINDO DRINTHT MK G
11772,IT'S BECAUSE THEY DO THEIR OWN PHOTOSYNTHESIS WHICH THEY MAKE THEIR OWN FOOD,BECAUSE THE ES W
11773,IT HAS ALL THREE THINGS WATER AIR AND SUNSHINE,TAS A THREE WATER AR IN SAUN SHN
11774,I THINK ANYTHING ELSE TO POINT OUT TO ME IS LIKE WHEN THE YEAST KIND OF LIKE RISES FROM THE BREAD EXCEPT IT GETS IT PUFFY FOR THE AIR OR CARBON DIOXIDE THAT FLOWS IN THE BAG,I THINKGITOTKWA FROMTHEO
11775,YES IT CAN BECAUSE IF IT DOESN'T HAVE ANY SUNSHINE IT WILL TURN LIKE FIRST DAY IT WILL TURN TAN THEN IT WILL TURN YELLOW NOT GREEN,I BEC DOUSN'T HAVE  SONHLT TH YELLO
11776,IT'S ALL HEALTHY AND BECAUSE IT HAS ALL THREE THINGS WATER AIR AND SUNSHINE,H NY BECAUS IT HAS ATHR THINK WATER AIN SAN
11777,WHAT I OBSERVE IS LIKE LITTLE TINY PARTICLES INSIDE THE YEAST WHEN IT'S LIKE KIND OF LIKE MIXED WITH THE WATER,BR KE   PAUTACLES INSIDE THE  MT WITH THE WATER
11778,IT'S A HOUSE,
11779,WHAT'S IMPORTANT ABOUT PRODUCERS IS BECAUSE THEY MAKE THEIR OWN FOOD AND ONCE A CONSUMER COMES BECAUSE THEY CAN'T MAKE THEIR OWN FOOD THEY HAVE TO EAT SOMETHING THAT'S WHY THEY EAT THE PRODUCERS,BOTUCEEAKE RMUCR
11780,THAT MEANS IT'S A ALL AND HEALTHY PLANT,THAT MENS  A  NUUAEDN HELTHY PLAN
11781,IT'S BECAUSE THEY NEED LIGHT ENERGY CARBON DIOXIDE AND WATER SO ALL THOSE THINGS SO IT CAN PRODUCE IT'S OWN FOOD WITHOUT THOSE THREE THINGS IT CAN NOT GROW,BECAUSETHE ENER HEWATEDU FTE THNO
11782,THERE IS ONE OF LIKE PARALLEL THERE IS THAT IS PALMATE AND THERE'S ONE THAT IS PARALLEL,THEIS ONIS ONETH I THERS ONE TH IS
11783,SOME EXAMPLES ARE SIMPLE LEAF PARALLEL LEAF AND PALMATE LEAF,SOME EAXAMPLES ARNIF
11784,I THINK THE VEINS ARE FOR LIKE THEY ALSO USE LIKE THE BLOOD WHICH IT PUMPS IN KIND OF LIKE THE HUMAN BODY'S VEINS,I THINK TH VAINS AROTE EA LIKE TH BD IKE T HUMON BO VAN
11785,I'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT VEINS FROM LEAVES AND FROM SAP FROM TREES AND ALSO SOME OTHER STUFF FROM SCIENCE,IVE BEN LERNING ABOT VIS FROM LEES FROM SAP FROMTHER STAPFROM S
11786,ONE IS CALLED SIMPLE ANOTHER IS PALMATE AND THE THIRD ONE IS PARALLEL,ONE  ALTHERIN THE THRD P
11787,I THINK IT COMES FROM THE AIR CAUSE KIND OF LIKE FROM THE CLOUDS IT GIVES LIKE WATER OUT ONCE IT RAINS SO I THINK THAT'S WHY,I THINK IT OMS FROM THE ARC A FROM THE GS  WATERIHITH
11788,IT IS THE PATTERN OF THEIR VEINS AND ALSO THE OUTSIDE SHAPE WHICH IT WAS BORN WITH,IS T PATTERN OF THE VANS NTH OSIDE SCHAP WIHE WS BOARN WITH
11789,THAT TELLS ME THAT IT IS A SIMPLE LEAF,T TLS METHIS A MEIF
11790,I THINK IT'S A SIMPLE LEAF BECAUSE IT'S KIND OF LIKE HALF AND HALF AND IT'S ALL PARALLEL AND IT'S KIND OF LIKE THE SAME ON HALF,I THINKS AIEFE BECASIE AAE LIKE THE SAMENA
11791,I THINK IT IS A SIMPLE LEAF BECAUSE IT'S VEINS ARE GOING KIND OF LIKE A CIRCULAR OUTSIDE DIRECTION,I THINK IEF BECAUSE  VINS AR GIN CN IE A CIRCEAR OUTSID DIRECTION
11792,HOW IT GETS IT'S NUTRIENTS AND THAT'S GETTING OUT OF IT KIND OF LIKE THE CARBON DIOXIDE IT'S BREATHE I MEANT SORRY THE OXYGEN IT'S BREATHING OUT,WLL GTNEW TANS IN THE
11793,I THINK IT WAS SOMEBODY THAT PUT A GUY A BAG AND POURED WATER IN IT OR MAYBE IT WAS JUST RAIN,I THINK T WAS SOMEHGP WATER MABTWS JUSTRA
11794,IT IS THE AIR AND WATER I SEE LIKE PARTICLES OF AIR AND PARTICLES OF WATER,TH A WAERI E LIKE ARTACLES  APAURTACLES OF WATER
11795,LIKE THE PHLOEM IS LIKE GOING DOWN IN THE PLANT LIKE IT'S NUTRIENTS AND PROBABLY THAT KIND OF LIKE THE OXYGEN THAT'S COMING OUT OF IT,KE GOING DOWN NNEWANENTHARAN
11796,I AM DOING GOOD TODAY,IMING GO TOAY
11797,THAT IT HAS LIKE DIFFERENT THINGS LIKE LIKE THE NUTRIENTS GO INSIDE AND THEN SOMETHING ELSE GOES OUTSIDE OF IT,A K RNT THINGS LIKE IKE THE NEW CINO INANE SOMTHIN USIDET
11798,THE ESOPHAGUS IT DOES THAT PUSHES ALL THE FOOD DOWN INTO THE STOMACH,THE OFFPUSHS ATHE ET DOW IN TO THE STUMAK
11799,MOUTH THE MOUTH USUALLY JUST CHEWS IT AND SWALLOWS IT,MOUTH YOAY JUST C WOLLO
11800,OH IT IT PUSHES DOWN ALL THE CHEWED UP FOOD LIKE IT LIKE THOSE LITTLE BITS SO IT COULD LIKE FIT THROUGH THAT KIND OF LIKE LITTLE TUBE OF THE ESOPHAGUS,PUSH DWNATHKE   BITTTH SOFT
11801,I SEE,I
11802,JUST TO USUALLY JUST TO BREAK DOWN THE FOOD AND ONCE YOU'RE HUNGRY YOU EAT SOME SO IT WON'T GO KIND OF LIKE HUNGRY FOR A LITTLE BIT,USSTHOT YOUR NR U EAT SMORYT
11803,I THINK WHAT'S FOR THE MUSCLE CELLS IS LIKE THEY HELP YOUR MUSCLES GROW OR SOMETHING OR I THINK THEY'LL HELP YOU MOVE IT,I THINK FR THE MOHPOUR MOUSTL SOMTHINH
11804,THEY ARE PROBABLY MADE OUT OF MEAT,THEY ARE POBLY MAE OET
11805,LIKE IN A DIGESTIVE SYSTEM IT HAS TO HAVE LIKE SOME KIND OF CELLS CAUSE MAYBE LIKE THE SALIVA THAT'S BEEN IN YOUR MOUTH ONCE YOU EAT IT MAYBE THOSE CELLS KIND OF LIKE BREAK IT DOWN,IGGESTIOVAMA KEIROTHWEN
11806,THINK THE LEAF HAS LIKE A TON OF,THELEIF HAS   TI
11807,THERE ARE LIKE ALL SORTS OF CELLS AND MAYBE THEY CARRY THE NUTRIENTS FOR THE ARM SO THE SKIN'S HEALTHY,THE A LIKE AL SORTS SMABAI THE NEW CON FTHE
11808,DOING GOOD,UINGGO
11809,THEY USUALLY JUST BREAK DOWN THE FOOD WHICH YOU EAT WHEN YOU'RE HUNGRY,AUST PING THE UR NGRY
11810,I THINK WHAT THEY ARE IS LIKE SOME KIND OF LIKE NUTRIENTS THAT HELP THE SKIN LIKE STAY LIKE HEALTHY AND STAYS SMOOTH,I THINK WTH AR IKE  SOMECNNEUT THE TH
11811,IT'S TRYING TO SHOW ME THOSE BRAIN CELLS,RYN TO SHO ME TH BRING SELL
11812,WHAT THE MOUTH DOES IS ONCE YOU CHEW IT GOES DOWN INTO YOUR BODY INTO THE STOMACH,UT THE MOUTHTOS ENTO YOUR BUDY T TUMK
11813,WHAT I NOTICE ABOUT IT IS A HUMAN BODY AND I THINK IT'S POINTING TO CERTAIN THINGS WHERE THE CELLS ARE FOR MOST IMPORTANT STUFF,T NOTSABOUT  A HUMN OI THINK THINK W THAMSTORTNT
11814,I THINK THE BUTTERFLY HAS CELLS BECAUSE IT NEEDS SOME KIND IF THING LIKE IT LIKE SUCKS UP POLLEN,I THINK THE BIRFL AS  BCOME CINDO THING
11815,WHAT IT TELLS ME IS LIKE THERE'S LIKE HUGE CELLS AND LIKE THERE'S LESS CELLS IN A LEAF BECAUSE THEIR ALL ALL THE CELLS ARE IN ONE SECTION,T TELLS ME   E NLIF BECAUSEE AR IN ON SECION
11816,I SEE ALL SORTS OF CELLS AND I SEE SOME VEINS PLUS I SEE THE SKIN,I E AL SORT ESINI SE  V
11817,IT USUALLY JUST USUALLY JUST PUSHES IT DOWN INTO THE STOMACH THAT'S PROBABLY WHICH I ALL KNOW,JUS JUST PUSHDOWN NT
11818,THEY ARE THEY ARE ALL SORTS OF CELLS,T AR AL SORTS OF SELLES
11819,THEY BOTH DRINK,TEY BOTHRAIN
11820,LIKE IT'S KIND OF LIKE ALL IN THE DIGESTIVE SYSTEM LIKE ALL OVER YOUR BODY LIKE SOMEHOW IT COULD LIKE BREAKS IT DOWN OR HAS A CERTAIN JOB TO DO FOR THE WHOLE BODY,A AIN THE DITVK SOM  HAS A ARNBTHEY
11821,I NOTICE THAT WHAT THIS IS SIMILAR TO THEM THAT THEY HAVE CELLS,I NOTESE THELLER TO THEM TH THE HA SE
11822,I THINK WHAT IT'S TRYING TO SHOW US IS LIKE ONCE YOU EAT IT WHERE IT GOES THROUGH AND HOW LIKE THE STEPS WHERE IT GOES THROUGH TO BREAK DOWN ALL THE FOOD AND THEN YOU PEE IT OUT,I THINK TRY TO SHO KENAE GOS HTHTEPTOBRAG OWNALTI THT
11823,I SEE LIKE SHAPES KIND OF LIKE A AND MAYBE THERE WILL BE ALL SORTS OF CELLS KIND OF LIKE A TO TELL LIKE MESSAGES TO THE BODY,I SE HS CO IKE A MB A SRKAMOMENT TT MSES TOTHO
11824,I THINK WHAT THE MUSCLE CELLS ARE LIKE THEY HELP YOUR MUSCLES MOVE,I THINK W AR  HPYOU MO
11825,I THINK THEY ARE BECAUSE THEY BOTH HAVE BLOOD INSIDE OF EACH OTHER,I THINK THEY AR BCASE THE T HA  INSIDE OF ETATHER
11826,I THINK THIS WAS TRYING TO SHOW IS KIND OF LIKE THE YEAST IS KIND OF LIKE THE SKIN OF A HUMAN BODY,I THINK TRYN TO SHOA A O A HUMN BOUDY
11827,BUT I ALSO KNOW IS JUST TRAVELS ALL ALONG WITH THOSE CELLS LIKE WITH THE FOOD HOW LIKE SIDE BY SIDE OR LIKE IN A LINE OR SOMETHING,LOOS TRALES ALL ALONG WITHETSDBYSD LIKEAINR SOTHN
11828,THAT IT HAS ALL CELLS BECAUSE IT'S A LIVING ORGANISM,THAT AS A SES BECAUS IS ORGAN
11829,I THINK WHAT THOSE BRAIN CELLS LIKE THEY LIKE SEND MESSAGES TO THE BODY LIKE LIKE TELL THE HAND TO MOVE,I THINK WTTH VRAIN  E AM MSAS TOTHBOA
11830,IT'S THE GASTRIC JUICE IN THE ACID,I GA JUICE IN THE ED
11831,THE SKIN CELLS ARE FOR LIKE YOUR SKIN SO THEY STAY HEALTHY,THE SKINELA I
11832,I THINK THEY'RE BOTH DIFFERENT CELLS BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT WORKING FOR LIKE LIKE YEAST CELLS ARE NOT WORKING FOR HUMAN CELLS,THER BTHRN SELLCIINGS ARE NOT WIN FO HUMOLS
11833,I'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT THE DIGESTIVE SYSTEM AND ALSO I'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT LIKE HOW IT WORKS THROUGH YOUR BODY,I'VE BEN LERIG ABOUTHEJETAN AL LEARINGYOUR BOY
11834,IT WAS IMPORTANT BECAUSE THEY HAVE TO BE GOOD IN HAVE TO PUT IN GOOD AND IF IF THEY'RE NOT WELL DONE THEY CAN BREAK,TIS NPOARTON BECAUS I E
11835,I THINK WHAT I WOULD LIKE TO TEST IS SEEING SEEING HOW FAR IT GOES AND SEEING THE LI THE BLOCK CAN GO BE HEAVIER,I THINK ID LIKE THF
11836,I THINK IT'S,
11837,WE HAVE SEEN A FLIPPER SYSTEM,
11838,GOOD BYE,Y
11839,YOU NEED A SOMETHING TO MAKE IT FLIP YOU NEED YOU NEED A STICK AND TO MEASURE IT,YOU  SOMTHING TO MLIAYOU EATA STICK IN TOMERANT
11840,I THINK YOU WOULD JUST BY UM FOR EXAMPLE YOU CAN SAY THE BROOK HOLDS THE STICK IN AND IT MAKES IT AND YOU MEASURE IT AND IT MAKES IT GO IN,I THNK  W  GSAPL YOU CTHEOTICK ANRMASER N
11841,IT MAKES IT A SYSTEM BECAUSE THE PROPELLER'S SPINNING AROUND,MAK I BECAUSHRPLLERS PNGROUND
11842,I THINK WE HAVEN'T,
11843,WE HAVE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT FLIPPERS AND WE HAVE BEEN YEAH WE HAVE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT FLIPPERS,A LARNING ABOT FW HV
11844,I THINK WHAT YOU CAN CHANGE YOU CAN,LOUK TO SE T  FARTHER
11845,I THINK WHAT THAT IS ALL ABOUT IS MEASURING IT AND SEEING HOW FAR IT GOES,I THINK W THATH IS ALL BOTN SING HOW F GO
11846,I THINK WHAT'S GOING ON THERE IT MAKES A GOOD FLIPPER SYSTEM BECAUSE IT BOUNCES OFF AND IT HOLDS IT TIGHT AND YOU DON'T WANT TO BOUNCE IT OFF THAT HIGH BECAUSE THE THE STICK CAN BREAK,I THINK  INGNIBECAUS
11847,I'M VERY GOOD,VERY GOOD
11848,YOU CAN ALSO UM DO A SMALLER STICK AND SEE YEAH YOU CAN DO THAT TOO,YOU CAN  MOTHERTICK  TOE
11849,WHEN YOU CLICK IT IT BOUNCES OFF,WEYON
11850,THESE ARE ALL ABOUT MEASURING HOW FAR THE BROOK GOES AND SEEING IF IT GOES THAT FAR,THRECS ARBOT MN  ING
11851,I FOUND OUT THAT YOU GET YOU'RE MEASURING IT AND THAT YOU'RE SEEING HOW FAR THE BROOK GOES AND IF IT DOESN'T GO THAT FAR YOU PUT THE CAPACITY YOU WRITE THE CAPACITY AND YOU,IFNDR MASERNTRT
11852,UM YOU CAN FLIP,YOU CAN  THES EXPE
11853,UM YOU CAN THINK OF,OU CAN THIN
11854,I THINK WHAT THE BASE IS ALL ABOUT IS MEASURING IT AND LIKE SEEING IF IT GOES FAR,I THINK BABOT
11855,I THINK WHAT IS UP WITH THAT OBJECT WOULD BE UM SEEING HOW FAR IT GOES MAYBE,I THINK  IS P  OB SING HO FR
11856,UM YOU CAN THE BLOCK THAT HOLDS THE STICK IT CAN BE SMALLER OR IT CAN BE HEAVIER,YOU OK T HOLD THE STICKIT CN BE SMOLLERT CAN BE HEVYER
11857,THERE IS SOMETHING ON THE ON TOP OF IT AND THAT YOU HOLD IT YOU PUT IT UNDER THE BLOCK AND YOU JUST FLIP IT AND YOU SEE HOW FAR IT GOES,THE SOMTHNG TOLP NEH JUSTLPON OU SE HO IR O
11858,IT CONNECTS IT BY PUTTING THE STICK ON THE BOTTOM OF THE BRICK AND IF IT GOES FAR YOU JUST PUSH IT IN YOU JUST TAKE IT OUT AND IT'S AND THEN JUST PUT IT,T PUING TKON THE BOTTOME  THE JUSTTAK
11859,SPINNING THE RUBBERBAND AROUND AND SEEING HOW HOW FAR IT GOES,I THINKA IS ALL ABOUT
11860,SYSTEMS ARE ALL ABOUT MEASURING AND DOING SEEING SEEING WHAT HOW THE SYSTEM LOOKS,MR ABOUT M ININGHOHEO
11861,WHAT'S GOING ON WITH THAT IS THAT WE HAVE TO LEARN ABOUT PENDULUMS WE HAVE TO LEARN HOW TO P HOW TO DO SCIENCE AND AND TO LEARN MORE THINGS,A LRN ABOUT WE HVE  LNH ONSNN TO LRNM THINGKS
11862,NO SOME OF THEM HOLD TEN OR NINE,OME THE H
11863,VERY WELL,VERRYWAL
11864,YOU CAN BUILD THEM OUT OF LIFEBOATS YOU CAN BUILD THEM OUT OF WOOD,YOU CAN BILLDIE BARTS YOU CAN ILL THE MATEROD
11865,LEARN ABOUT O,
11866,I I THINK I'M NOT SURE I THINK YOU HAVE TO MEASURE THIRTY CENTIMETERS ON THEM AND WE LEARNED HOW TO HOW MANY PENDULUMS THAT IT CAN HOLD AND HOW MUCH WATER IT CAN HOLD,I THINK MRAED THIRT VMAMNY ACAHOLDWATERCAHOLDE
11867,ABOUT ELEVEN AND C COULD HAVE TEN AND THE SHORTEST ONE COULD HAVE EIGHT,EVEN  SE CAN  ENTHE IRTSTON CAND AV HT
11868,I THINK IT COULD CONNECT TO THE CAPACITY OF THE BOAT WOULD BE WE CAN JUST MEASURE MEASURE EM AND IT CAN BE EIGHTY MILLIMETERS OR SIXTY TWO MILLIMETERS THIRTY EIGHT FIFTY FIVE MILLIMETERS,THNT E CANBEMATEOSIX TW MMATEO THR FIFTY FIVE AOES
11869,BYE,
11870,I'VE BUILT MINE OUT OF PA OUT OF PAPER CUPS,I B MY AR   POPER C
11871,FIRST YOU HAVE TO MEASURE A THE BOAT AND SEE AND PUT IT IN THE WATER AND YOU I THINK YOU MEASURE THIRTY CENTIMETERS ON THEM AND THEN YOU'D NEED TO,F OU HAVEEPUT IN THE WATER NK AE THRTY SEVN TO MATOES
11872,WHY I THINK THEY GOT A DIFFERENT NUMBER OF PENNIES IS BECAUSE THEY CUTTED THEM SHORTER OR LONGER,W TNKAABECASHS
11873,I WOULD THINK ABOUT PUTTING PENNIES IN IT OR WATER,THNBOUT PUTING PANS INWATER
11874,I DISCOVERED THAT THE BOAT CAN FIT TWELVE TWELVE PENDULUMS IN THE LITTLE BOAT,VE DSERE CAN  W PANMS IN THE LATER BOK
11875,WHEN I WHEN I NOTICED THAT A WASN'T DROWNING THAT MUCH I STARTED PUTTING MORE AND MORE UH PENDULUMS IN EM AND WHEN I DROWNED IT I I GOT MY ANSWER REALLY EASILY,OANO CH A STARTED R A
11876,WE HAVE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT BOATS AND WE HAVE BEEN PUTTING PENDULUMS IN THE BOATS AND SEEING HOW MANY PENDULUMS CAN FIT INSIDE THE LITTLE BOAT,WEHVE LEARINGS I HO MY AS CN FIT INSID HE ATEROT
11877,WE,SQUE
11878,THE LIFEBOATS ARE ALL ABOUT YOU GO YOU CAN GO ON A ROMANTIC DATE YOU CAN,GOT THE RERTHEM YOU CAN HAVE A BI
11879,WHAT IS GOING ON THERE IS THE PROPELLER IS THE STRING IS MAKING IT BALANCE IT AND IT KEEPS GOING AROUND AND AROUND PROPELLER KEEPS GOING AROUND AND AROUND,INGNETNMAKN  SDEROUNL GINROUNOUND
11880,I THINK IT WILL BECAUSE IT HAS TO HAVE MORE POWER ON IT AND IT HAS TO GO UP FARTHER AND I THINK THAT WOULD AFFECT IT,I THINK  WILL BECAS  AVE M  TO GFORHE
11881,SO IT HAS ALSO BEEN NICE TALKING TO YOU MARTY,AS ASOB NICE
11882,WHAT WE'VE BEEN DOING IN SCIENCE WE WERE WE HAVE BEEN DOING AIRPLANES WE HAVE BEEN SEEING IS THE AIRPLANE PROPELLER CAN FLY,R ING INSD N AIPAEGIPAN IPE
11883,THANK YOU,E
11884,THANK YOU,KE
11885,I THINK WHEN SETTING UP YOUR MY EXPERIMENT WAS IT WAS TRICKY TO PUT IT TOGETHER BUT IT WORKED REALLY WELL AND,I THINK AN SAING M XPERMENT WATHERW
11886,IT'S GOING VERY WELL MARTY,SINGVEYWA
11887,YOU CAN ALSO CHANGE THE PROPELLER YOU CAN USE FISHING YOU CAN USE FISHING WIRE AND YOU CAN MAKE THE PROPELLER SMALLER YOU CAN MAKE THE THE,
11888,YOU,
11889,OKAY SO HOW MANY SPINS IT TAKES SPINS ARE FORTY FIVE SPINS IT MADE AND THE DISTANCE IS HOW MUCH METER HOW MUCH METERS YOU MEASURE IT,NAT FIVENSTAN
11890,SO WHAT THE PARTS OF THE PLANE I USE THE PROPELLER IS MAKING IT SPIN AND THE STRING THE STRAW AND THE STRING IS MAKING IT BALANCE IT,PERSOPLAYING YTPEERMAKINGITHTRING MAKING A B
11891,I THINK THE KINDS OF THINGS THAT ARE IMPORTANT WHAT MAKES IF FLY IS THE PROPELLER MAKES IT FLY AND THAT THE STRING IS BALANCED AND A AND THAT THE STRAW IS GREAT IS PUT GOOD ON IT,I THINKN THING ERMTWTH VENA
11892,I THINK WHAT THAT IS ALL ABOUT IT MAKES THE PROPELLER SPIN AND IF WE DON'T HAVE THE RUBBER BAND IN THE BOTTOM IT'S NOT GOING TO WORK,I THINK AHIS OK  IR HA H WATER
11893,YOU HAVE TO THE PROPELLER IS ALL ABOUT MAKING THE PROPELLER SPIN,HA O TH RPELLER IS ALL ABOUT MAKING THE RPELER ON
11894,WHEN IT SPINS THE THING ON THE BOTTOM SPINS AROUND TOO WITH IT AND M AND THEN YOU MEASURE HOW MUCH FAR IT WENT,H PINING NTHEPINS ROUNDTHNEW ME MCH
11895,I THINK THE NUMBER OF SWINGS ISN'T RIGHT BECAUSE YOU HA ALSO THE STRING HAS TO BE BALANCED AND THE PROPELLER HAS TO BE MOVING,I THINKTHE RA IS INM R BECAUA A STRENHAS TBE V NTHRPELLER HST
11896,WITH STRING,S
11897,THANK YOU,
11898,MARNIE,
11899,I THINK WHAT IS IMPORTANT ABOUT THE FLYING LINE IS BECAUSE AND IT ATTACHES TO IT AND IT MAKES IT BALANCE AND IF E YOU DON'T HAVE IT ON THE BOTTOM IT'S GONNA NOT GO THAT FAST,I THINK T S ANPARABOTHETATI TOATT AVETTE
11900,OKAY,
11901,WHAT YOU CAN ALSO DO WHEN THE PARTS ARE ALL WORKING TOGETHER IS YOU CAN PUT THE STRING INTO THE STRAW AND THEN YOU CAN JUST SWING IT ACROSS AND IT BALANCE IT AND IF IT DOESN'T BALANCE IT'S GOING TO WIGGLE A LOT,YOUNAERTHE TRING NEROU CAODS BS
11902,OKAY,
11903,I THINK THAT IF THE STRING ISN'T BALANCED THAT WELL IT'S NOT GONNA WORK IT'S NOT GONNA SPIN IT'S IT'S IT'S JUST NOT GONNA WORK,I THINK T   B
11904,YEAH THAT'S IT,THERPER  T JUS STAPLE HE T OTHERHE
11905,I AM VERY WELL HOW ARE YOU MARNIE,UMOR
11906,I THINK THE OTHER THINGS THAT ARE IMPORTANT WHEN YOU ARE FLYING YOUR PLANE IS THAT IT'S REALLY BALANCED AND IT'S NOT WIGGLING A LOT AND THAT YOUR PROPELLER SPINS,I THINKAR THINGS WEYOUBAINPON
11907,I THINK THE PROPELLERS ARE ALL ABOUT I AM GUESSING THAT THE PROPELLERS ARE TO KEEP IT BALANCED,N TH PALRS A BOI'M ING  THIRPARR EP VNT
11908,ME TOO,MU
11909,UM WELL MAYBE IT'S YOU HAVE TO PUT THE AIRPLANE HANGING ATTACHED TO A STRING AND YOU HAVE TO SEE HOW IF IT CAN FLY,MPUT THE AIRPLAN HANG  TOUCHED TO A SRIN F
11910,BYE IT'S BEEN NICE TALKING TO YOU TOO,IN ICE TALKINGYOUU
11911,I THINK HOW I MIGHT AFFECT IT IS BECAUSE THE SECOND ONE ISN'T REALLY WELL DONE AND IF IT GOES UP IT'S GONNA GO BACK DOWN AND THE FIRST ONE IS GONNA KEEP GOING STRAIGHT,ITHINK H CA ET
11912,I THINK IT'S BALANCING IT AND IT'S MAKING THE AIRPLANE FLY,I THINKS EA SING I MAKING THE AIRPLANF
11913,THANK YOU,
11914,THE STRING WAS ALL ABOUT SEEING HOW FAST THE AIRPLANE COULD H FLY AND THE STRING,THE STRING AS A ABOUT SING HO FAS THEEAON THE TRIN

11929,MAGNETISM IS WHEN UM THE MAGNET CAN STICK TO THINGS WITH IRON IN THEM,ANT CICTHINGS WITH R
11930,IT IS PICKING UP SOMETHING WITH IRON IT JUST LIKE THE THE MAGNET IS DOING TO THE NAIL,PNG SOHIN WITH JUST KANT UING THE NAL
