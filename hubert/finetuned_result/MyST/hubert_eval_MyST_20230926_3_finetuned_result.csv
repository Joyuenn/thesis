2483,IF YOU HAVE A MAGNET RIGHT HERE ON THIS PIECE ON THE BIG PIECE OF PAPER AND A MAGNET RIGHT HERE ON THE THIN PIECE OF PAPER AND A PENCIL RIGHT HERE IT WON'T BE STRONG ENOUGH TO PULL TOWARDS THIS WITH A PENCIL BEHIND IT,IF YOU HAVE A MAGNET RIGHT HERE ON THIS PIECE OF ON THE BIG PIECE OF PAPER AND A MAGNET RIGHT HERE ON THE THEN PIECE OF PAPER AND A PENCIL RIGHT HERE IT WON'T BE STRONG ENOUGH TO PULL TOWARDS THIS WITH A PENCIL BEHIND IT
2484,THE FORCE OKAY,THE FORCE OKAY
2485,WELL THE NAIL HAS A MAGNETA FIELD AROUND IT SO IF YOU PUT THE MAGNET ON IT AND PUSH IT DOWN IT'S LIKE THE MAGNET WILL STICK TO THE PAPER CLIP ALWAYS,WELL THE NAIL HAS A MAGNETIC FIEELD AROUND IT SO IF YOU PUT THE MAGNET ON IT AND PUSH IT DOWN IT'S LIKE THE MAGNET WILL STICK TO THE PAPER CLIP ALWAYS
2486,IT'S BASICALLY JUST IT'S BASICALLY THE PAPER CLIP IS ALWAYS GONNA BE MAGNETIZED RATHER WHAT YOU DO IT'S GOING TO BE MAGNETIZED BUT IF YOU HAVE SOMETHING TOO THICK THE MAGNET WON'T STICK TO THE PAPER CLIP,IT'S BASICALLY JUST IT'S BASICALLY THE PAPER CLIP IS ALWAYS GONN BE MAGNETIZED RATHER WHAT YOU DO IT'S GONNA BE MAGNETIZED BUT IF YOU HAVE  SOMETHING TOO THICK THE MAGNET WON'T STICK TO THE PAPER CLIP
2487,THE NAIL ISN'T FORCING THE PAPER CLIP UP TO IT BECAUSE THE MAGNET'S OFF IT AND ALSO THE FORCE IS OFF IT SO THE MAGNET STILL HAS A FORCE AND ABSERBED IT LIKE IT UP,THE NAIL ISNT FORCING THE PAPER CLIP UP TO IT BECAUSE THE MAGNET'S OFF IT AND ALSO THE FORCE IS OFF IT SO THE MAGNET STILL HAS THE FORCE AND ABSORBED IT LIKE SWILLED IT UP
2488,WELL MOSTLY I'VE BEEN LIKE JUST TRYING TO DISCOVER WHAT ELSE IS MAGNETS BY RUBBING A MAGNET ON SOMETHING THAT'S NOT MAGNETIZED AND IT WORKED,WELL MOSTLY I'VE BEEN LIKE JUST TRYING TO DISCOVERE WHAT ELSE ITS MAGNETS BY RUBBING A MAGNET ON SOMETHING THAT'S NOT MAGNETIZED AND IT WORKED
2489,BECAUSE OF THE FORCE IS FORCING IT TO STICK TOGETHER,BECAUSE OF THE FORCE IS FORCEING IT TO STICK TOGETHER
2490,OKAY SO IT'S THE GRAVITY IT'S CALLED A FORCE AND IF IT DOESN'T STICK THAT'S FORCING IT AWAY FROM IT,OKAY SO IT'S THE GRAVITY IT'S CALLED THE FORCE AND IF IT DOESN'T STICK THAT'S FORCING IT AWAY FROM IT
2491,THE NAIL WON'T PICK UP THE PAPER CLIP BECAUSE IT'S NOT MAGNETIZED YET,THE NAILWONT PICK UP THE PAPER CLIP BECAUSE TIT'S NOT MAGNETIZED YET
2492,THE NAIL ISN'T PICKING UP THE PAPER CLIP BECAUSE THE FORCE IS ALWAYS IN THE MAGNET,THE NAIL ISN'T PICKING UP THE PAPER CLIP BECAUSE THE FORCE IS ALWAYS IN THE MAGNET
2493,NETISM BASICALLY IS VERY VERY IMPORTANT,THI IS ONLY BASICALLY IS VERY VERY IMPORTANT
2494,CAUSE THE NAIL IS GETTING THE MAGNETIC FORCE FROM THE MAGNET SO FOR INSTANCE IF YOU KEPT DOING IT IT WILL MAKE THE PAPER CLIP STICK,CAUSE THE NAIL IS GETTING THE MAGNETIC FORCE FROM THE MAGNET SO FOR INSTANCE IF YOU KEPT DOING IT IT WILL MAKE THE PAPER CLIP STICK
2495,IT'S CALLED A SHOW FLOW,IT'S CALLED A SHILLPHLOW
2496,EVERYTHING WILL DROP BECAUSE MOST OF THE RINGS ARE GETTING STUCK FROM THE MAGNET,EVERYTHING WILL DROP BECAUSE MOST OF THE RINGS ARE GETTING STUCK FROM THE MAGNET
2497,THE RIVET IS UM SURROUNDED BY ALL THE WIRES THAT ARE TYING IT UP,THE RIVET IS UM SURROUNDED BY ALL THE WIRES THAT ARE TIGNING IT UP
2498,OKAY OKAY CAN WE JUST MOVE ONTO ANOTHER THING,OKAY OKAY CASE WE JUST MOVE ONTO ANOTHER THING
2499,BECAUSE ALL THE ENERGY FLOWS AROUND AND AROUND AND AROUND AND AROUND THE RIVET AND GOES BACK INTO THE BATTERY AND DOES IT AGAIN,BECAUSE ALL THE ENERGY FLOWSE AMOUNTIN AROUND ANDROUND AROUND THE RIVET AND GOES BACK TOH THE BATTERY AND DOES IT AGAIN
2500,CAUSE IF THE SWITCH IS CLOSED THAT MEANS THE CIRCUIT WORKS CAUSE IT'S AN ELECTROMAGNET,CAUSE IF THE SWITCH IS CLOSED THAT MEANS THE CIRCUIT WORKS CAUSE HIT'S AN ELECTROMAGNET
2501,EVERYTHING WILL FLY UP,EVERYTHING WILL FLY UP
2502,CLO HO HOSE,CLOSEOSE
2503,SO ALL THE ENERGY CAN COME AND STICK TOGETHER,SO ALL THE ENERGY CAN COME AND STICK TOGETHER
2504,THAT MEANS IT'S AN OPEN CIRCUIT,THAT MEANS IT'S AN OPEN CIRCUIT

5442,WELL IF SUN IS SHARING THE CELL THEN ITS WORKING BUT WHEN IT GOES OFF THERE IS NO WORK AND THE FLAG WILL,WHEN THE SUN IS HIATTING THE CELL THAT IT' IT S WORKY BUT WHEN IT GOES ALL THE IT WON'T WORK AND THE FLAG WIB
5443,THE ELECTRICITY WILL GO THROUGH THE D CELL AND IT WILL TURN ON THE FLAG,THE ELECTRICITY WON'T GO THROUGH THE D CELL AND IT WILL TE O THE FLAG
5444,THE D CELLS ELECTRICITY MAKES THE FLAG MOVE,PRODUCERS ELECTRICITY MAKE THE
5445,THE ELECTRICITY GOES THROUGH THE WIRES AND UNTIL IT'S CELL AND THEN IT GOES INTERACT WHEN WILL CONTRACTION AND THEN IT MAKES THE FLAG MOVE,THE ELECTRICITY GOES THROUGH THE WIRES AND INTO  TE CELL AND THEN IT GOES INTO THAT LITTLE CONTRACTION AND THEN IT MAKES THE FLAG MOMOVE
5446,IT MAKES THE FLAG MOVE,IT MAKES THE FLAG MOVE
5447,NO NAIL,NO NAME
5448,AND ELECTRICITY GO THROUGH THE TWO WIRES TO MAKE A FLAG MOVE BECAUSE THE FLAG IS METAL ON BOTH SIDES SO THE METAL TOUCHES THAT IT TURNS ON MAKE THROUGH ELECTRICITY,ITS TE ELECTRICITY FLONS THROUGH THE TWO WIRES SO MAK TH FA MOVE BECAUSE THE FLAG IS METAL ON BOTH SIDES SO HE MAT TOUCHES IT IT TURNS ON A EELECTRICITY
5449,THE CELL HAS BEHIND THE SUN AND THEN THE WIRES CONNECT ALL THE WAY TO THE CONTRACTION AND THEN MAKE REFLECTIVE SO ELECTRICITY GOES THROUGH THE FEW THING OVER AND OVER AND OVER,THE CELL HAS TO BE HITTING THE SUN AND THEN THE WIRES CONNECT ALL THE WAY TO THAT CONTRACTION AND THEN MAKE THE FLAG MOVE SO ELECTRICITY GOES THROUGH THE OLD THING OVER AND OVER AND OVER
5450,IT'S ON THE METAL WHERE THE WIRE IS SO IT DOESN'T COUNT ALL THE WAY BUT IT GOES ON LIKE SO THERE JUST IT IS ELECTRICITY PASS THERE SO THEY WAS ON TOP WHAT A PRETTY AS MUCH ELECTRICITY,IT'S ON THE METAL WHERE THE WIRE IS SO IT DOESN'T GO ON ALL THE WAY BUT IT GOES ON LIKE HALF WAY SO THEEETRICITY ELECTRICITY FASTER SO IF TIT WAS ON TOP NIT WOULDN'T PRODUCE SO MUCH ELECTRICITY
5451,THE ELECTRICITY GOING THROUGH,THAT E ELECTRICITY 'IS GOING THROUGH
5452,BECAUSE THEY DIDN'T THEN IT WHAT IF WORK AS WELL AS A IT'S DOWN SO WHILE WE ITS DARK ANYTHING OUTSIDE WILL NOT WORK,BECAUSE IF IT DIDNN'T THEN IT WOULDN'T WORK AND WILL AS IT IS NOW SO WHEN I IT'S DARK AND IT'S OUTSIDE WILL NOT WORK
5453,IT'S NOT GOING TO TILL BECAUSE THE SWITCHES OFF AND IT'S NOT CREATING A CIRCUIT TO MAKE THE FLAG MOVE,IT'S NOT GONTA GON THROUGH BECAUSE THE SWITCH IS OFF AND IT'S NOT CREATING A CIRCUIT TO MAKE THE FLAG RG
5454,NO,WELL
5455,IT'S NOT TOUCHING METAL SO WHERE ELECTRICITY WON'T GO TO THE FLAG AND IT WILL MAKE A CIRCUIT,IT'S NOT TOUCHING METAL SO THE ELECTRICITY WOILD GO TO THE FLAG AND IT WILL MAK A CIRCUIT
5456,BECAUSE THE D CELL HAS ELECTRICITY IN IT SO WHEN THEN TWO CONNECTERS CONNECT TO THE METAL FIND ON BOTH SIDES AS THE SWITCH TOUCHES METAL THEN IT WILL START WORKING AND CREATE AND PUT IT WOULD ELECTRICITY TO THE FLAG,CAUSE THE D CELL HAS ELECTRICITY IN IT SOIN THE TWO CONNECTORS CONNECT TO THE METAL FLAG ON BOTH SIDES AND THE SWITCH TOUCHES METAL THEN ITWILL START WORKING CREATE AND PRODUCL ELECTRICITY TO THE FLAG
5457,THE D CELL IS AT A CIRCUIT,THE D CELL IS IN A CIRCU AT THE CNTNICTION
5458,THOSE ARE ALSO THAT ELECTRICITY SO WHEN YOU PUT TWO WIRES ON THEY AND PUT A SET TO A D CELL AND PUTTING INTO SUN THEN VIBRATING TO BE LIKE THAT ELECTRICITY GOING THROUGH THAT CELL,THOSE ARE ALSO ABOUT THE ELECTRICITY SO WHEN YOU PUT TWO S ON IT AND PRODUCE ITTO A D CELL AND PUT IT IN T SUNN IT IS VIBRATING  LIKE A WARD STUFF THAT IT'S THE ELECTRICITY ON THROUGH THAT EL
5459,IT HAS TO BE ON THE METAL,IT HAS TO BE ON THE METAL
5460,WE'VE HAS BEEN CREATING CIRCUIT,WE'VE BEEN CREATING  CIRCUIT
5461,THEN IT DOESN'T WORK,THEN IT DOES IMPORNT
5462,THAT WHEN I TOUCH IT IT MOVES AND THEN I TOUCH IT AGAIN IT MOVES OFF THE CIRCUIT SO IT WILL PRODUCE THE ELECTRICITY BUT WON'T DOES TOUCH THE METAL AND PRODUCES ELECTRICITY,THAT WHEN I TOUCH IT IT MOVES ON THE TOUCH IT AGAIN IT MOVES OFF THE CIRCUIT SO IT WON'T PRODUCE THE ELECTRICITY  BECAUSE TOUCH HE IT PRODUCES ELECRICITY
5463,BECAUSE WHEN THE WIRE FIX THE D CELL AND OTHER ELECTRICITY DOESN'T LIKE CONTRACTED LIKE THEY CONTRACTED TOO,CAUSE WHEN   THE WIRE IT'S THE D CELL THE MANE  ELECTRICITY DOSTH CONTRACTION MAKES THE CATRACTION WORK
5464,THE FLAG MOVES,THE FLAG MOVES
5465,IT WOULDN'T WORK BECAUSE THAT'S BE SEMI AND MIKE HAS BEEN GETTING IT,IT WOULDN'T WORK BECAUSE IT HAS TO BE SUNNY AND T MYT HAS O BE HITDING I
5466,ELECTRICITY IS GOING THROUGH IT TO MAKE IT MOVE,ELECTRICITY IS GOING THROUGH IT TO MAKE IT MOVE
5467,THE D CELL AND THE ELECTRICITY,THE D CELL AND THE ELECTRICITY
5468,THE D CELL HAS TO BE ATTRACTED TWO WIRES TO GO THROUGH THE ELECTRICITY TO GET TO THE MOVE,IT SELL HAS TO BE O TO TO WIRES TO GO TO GO THROUGH THE ELECTRICITY TO GOT  TO THE BOT
5469,THE FLAG STOPS MOVING BECAUSE IT DOES THE SUNLIGHT AND IT IS HAVE ELECTRICITY BETWEEN THE WIRES,THE FLAG STOPS MOVING BECAUSE IT DO IT DOESN'T HAVE LIGHT AND IT DOESN'T HAVY ELECTRICITY BETWEEN I
5470,NO METAL IS PUT TOUCHING THOSE TWO WIRES AND LIKE THAT AND CONNECT STILL JUST READY TO GET THE,A METAL IS TOUCHI TO THE IR SO ETCAUS IT CAUSE E CTS E LECTRICITY TO GET  TFO HE
5471,I TALK TO YOU LATER BYE,I'LL TALK TO YOU LATER BYE
5472,YOU'RE SEPARATE NO AND THERE ITS IT'S LIKE WE BETTER SO YEAH,YUSE OD PUT AN NAIL IND THERE IT'S IT'S LIKE AWAY BETTER SO YEAH
5473,I DON'T KNOW,I DON'T KNOW
5474,ITS FLOWING THROUGH ELECTRICITY,IT'S FLOWING THROUGH ELECTRICITY
5475,ELECTRICITY IS GOING THROUGH IT OKAY,THE ELECTRICITY IS GOING THROUGH IT OKAY
5476,AND FINNALY MET BEFORE,I'M FINE WE'VE MET BEFORE
5477,WE'VE BEEN LEARNING SCIENCE YOU CAN TALKING TO ME ABOUT IT,WE'VE BEEN LEARNING SCIENCE EVER SINCE YOU'VE BEEN TALKING TO ME ABOUT IT
5478,YOUR DOWN,YOU'RE DONE
5479,BECAUSE THERE NOT METAL LIKE ALL THE OTHER ONCE,CAUSE THEY'RE NOT METAL LIKE ALL THE OTHER ONES
5480,IT WORKS BECAUSE IT'S A METAL,IT WORKS BECAUSE IT'S METAL
5481,WE SEEN EACH OTHER BEFORE,WE'VE SEEN EACH OTHER BEFORE
5482,JUST DRAW THE TAPE THE SPIRAL THAT ROCK IN STUFF ARE ALL INSULATORS BUT A OTHER STUFF IS CONDUCTORS,THE STRAW THE TAPE THE SPONGE THE ROCK AND STUFF ARE ALL INSULATORS BUT I ALL THE OTHER STUFF IS CONDUCTORS
5483,ONE THE METAL IS TOUCHING THE SWITCH SO I ALREADY KNOW THAT,USHING THIS INC THE METAL IS TOUCHING THE SWITCH SOYEAH I DON'T KNOW THAT
5484,THE NAIL,THE NAIL
5485,METAL IS SOMETHING IF SOMETHING'S METAL THEN AND IT STICKS TO SOMETHING ALL SIDES METAL THEN IT WOULD WORK AND IT WOULD COMPLETE CONDUCTOR,METAL IS SOMETHING IF SOMETHING'S METAL THEN AND IT STICKS TO SOMETHING ELSE THAT'S METAL THEN IT WOULD WORK AND IT WOULD COMPLETE A CONDUCTOR
5486,BECAUSE THE SWITCH IS METAL SO THAT'S METAL SO IT'S MAKE IN A WORK,CAUSE THE SWITCH IS METAL SO THAT'S METAL SO IT'S MAKING IT WORK
5487,INSULATORS ARE SOME STUFF THAT'S NOT METAL BUT CONDUCTORS ARE THINGS ARE METAL THAT MAKES JUST SITTING,INSULATORS ARE SOME STUFF THAT'S NOT METAL BUT UCONDUCTORS ARE THINGS THAT ARE METAL THAT MAKES E ELECTRICITY
5488,IT'S NOT GOING BECAUSE IF THAT'S NOT METAL THEN WORK,IT'S NOT GOING BECAUSE IF THAT'S NOT METAL THEN IT WON'T WORK
5489,I DON'T KNOW CAN YOU REPEAT THAT PLEASE,I DON'T KNOW CAN YOU REPEAT THAT PLEASE
5490,ELECTRICITY IS GOING TO THROUGH THE NAIL,ELECTRICITY 'S GOING THROUGH WITH A NAIL
5491,ITS OPEN,IT'S OPEN
5492,ALL THE OBJECTS WILL NOT MAKE ELECTRICITY GO,ALL THE OBJECTS WILL NOT MAKE ELECTRICITY GO
5493,YEAH I'M GOOD HOW ARE YOU I KNOW YOU WE MET BEFORE BUT NO I DON'T WANT TO MEET YOU,YEAH I'M GOOD HOW ARE YOU I KNOW WE'VE BEN BEFORE BUT NO I DON'T WANT TO MEAT SOI
5494,BECAUSE THE SWITCHES OFF AND IT'S CREATING A CIRCUIT ELECTRICITY ALL AWAY TO THAT MOTOR,CAUSE THE SWITCH IS OFF AND IT'S CREATING A CIRCUIT AND ELECTRICITY ALL THA WAY TO THAT ETATING MOTOR
5495,THE FLAG IS BEEN MOVING BECAUSE THE D CELL HAS TO BE,THE FLAG IST MOVING BECAUSE THE D CELL HAS TO BE HOOKED UP TO THE SWITCH
5496,WHEN I CLICK THE SWITCH AND IT GOES ON THE METAL IT WORKS AND GOES TO THE MOTOR CIRCUIT IT CREATE ELECTRICITY OVER THAT IT IS ON IT WON'T WORK,WHEN I CLICK THE SWITCH AND IT GOES ON THE MIEDDAL IT WORKS AND GOES TO THE MOTOR SO IT CAN CREATE ELECTRICITY BUT WHEN HEN IT IS ON IT WON'T WORK
5497,THE CELL IS HITTING THE MOTOR SO WHEN THE CELL HITS THE MOTOR THE WIRES IT ALWAYS TO THAT CELL AND THAT IT'S START WORKING,THE SUN IS HITTING THE MOTOR SO WHEN THE SUN HITS THE MOTOR THE WIRES HIT ALL THE WAY TO THE CELL AND THEN IT JUST STARTS WORKING
5498,IT WILL STOP WORKING BECAUSE IT'S NOT CREATING ELECTRICITY,IT WILL STOP WORKING BECAUSE IT'S LOT CREATING ELECTRICITY
5499,IT IS HAVING THE ELECTRICITY GOING TO THE MOTOR MAKE A FLAG MOVE,IT IS HAVING ELECTRICITY GOING TO THE MOTOR AND MAKING  FLAG MOOVE
5500,IT DOESN'T WORK,IT DOESN'T WORK

5502,IT DOESN'T WORK,IT DOESN'T WORK
5503,WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT CIRCUITS,WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT CIRCUITS
5504,BECAUSE IF IT DOESN'T HAVE IF THE SUN HAS TO HIT THAT LITTLE CONTRACTION THERE THEN IT WILL WORK,BCAUSE IF IT DOESN'T HIT IF THE SUN DOESN'T HIT THAT LITTLE CONTRACTHIN THERE THEN IT WON'T WORK
5505,WHEN YOU CLICK ON THE CELL ITS STARTS WORKING WILL A STOPS WORKING,WHEN I WHEN YOU CLICK ON THE SUN IT STARTS WORKING BUT WHEN IT'S A CLOUDY DAY IT STOPS WORKING
5506,LET THE SWITCH HAS TO BE OFF,THE SWITCH HAS TO BE OFF
5507,THE D CELL IS PUT DOES THE ELECTRICITY ALL AWAY TO THE MOTOR AND MAKING THE FLAG MOVE,THE D CELL IS PRODUCING ELECTRICITY ALL AF THE WAVE TO THE MOTOR AND MAKING THE FLAG MOVE
5508,NO,NO
5509,AND TILL,YOU TOO
5510,THE CELL IS HITTING THE MOTOR AND THE MOTOR SET UP THE TWO WIRES ALL THE WAY TO THE CELL SO WHILE THOUGH THAT CELL DOES HITTING IT IT STARTS WORKING,THE SUN IS HITTING THE MOTOR AND THE MOTORS HICKED UP THE TWO WIRES ALL THE WAY TO THE CELL SO WHEN THE SUN IS HITTING IT IT STARTS WORKING
5511,WHAT,WHAT
5512,IT DOESN'T WORK,IT DOESN'T WORK
5513,THE FLAG MOVES,THE FLAG MOVES
5514,IT DOESN'T WORK,IT DOESN'T WORK
5515,ELECTRICITY,ECTRICITY
5516,THAT PUT DOES THE ELECTRICITY,BAT PRODUCING T ELECTRICIT
5517,IT'S CREATING A CIRCUIT THAT MAKES THE MOTOR RUN AND MAKES THE FLAG MOVE,IT'S CREATING A SECOND THAT MAKES THE MOTOR RUN AND MAKES THE FLAG MOVE
5518,THAT IT RUNS WHEN THE FLAG MOVES BECAUSE THE CELL IS GAIN ELECTRICITY FROM THE SUN THAT TWO WIRES ARE HITTING THE MOTOR SO WAS THE TWO WIRES MAKE ELECTRICITY TO THE MOTOR THEN THE FLAG MOVE,THAT IT RUNS AND THE FLAG MOVES BECAUSE THE CELL IS GETTING ELECTRICITY FROM THE SUN THE TWO WIRES ARE HITTING THE MOTOR SO WHEN ENE THE TWO WIRES MAKING ELECTRICITY TO THE MOTOR THEN THE FLAG MOVES
5519,THAT IT'S OFF THE D CELL IT'S OFF THIS THE METAL SO IT WON'T MOVE THE FLAG,THAT IT'S OFF THE D CELL IS OFF THETHE METAL SO IT WON'T MOVE THE FLAG
5520,IT MAKES IT WORK,IT MAKES IT WORK
5521,IT WOULD BECAUSE IT'S NOT REALLY SUNNY,IT WOULDN'T WORK BECAUSE IT'S NOT REALLY STUNNY
5522,OKAY,OKAY
5523,THE CELL HAS TO BE HITTING IT,THE SUN HAS TO BE HITTING IT
5524,GOOD,GOOD
5525,THEY MAKE ELECTRICITY GO THROUGH,THEY MAKE ELECTRICITY GO THROUGH
5526,IT WOULDN'T WORK,IT WOULDN'T WORK
5527,NOW ITS GOING THE OPPOSITE WAY BUT ITS GOING SAME WAY BUT IF WAS TURNED AROUND THEY WOULD BE GO IN THE OPPOSITE WAY,NOW IT'S GOING THE OPPOSITE WAY BUT IT'S STILL GOING THE SAME WAY BUT IF IT WAS TURNED AROUND IT WOULD BE GOING THE OPPOSITE WAY
5528,ITS GOING THE DIFFERENT WAY ITS GOING LIKE THEN POSITIVE SIDE GO IN THE NEGATIVE SIDE GOING THESE WAY SO ITS GOING TO THE POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE SIDE BUT EVEN LIGHT BULB IS MUST BE ONE TO THE THAT'S I BUT ANYWAY ITS GOING THE OTHER,IT'S GOING THE DIFFERENT WAY IT'S GOING LIKE THEN DE POSITIVE SIDE  GO IN THE NEGATIVE SIDE'S GOING THIS WAY SO IT'S GOING THROUGH THE POSITIVE THE NEGATIVE SIDE BUT EVEN THOUG THE LIGHT BULB IS POUSB GOING THROUGH THAT SIDE BUT ANY WAY IT'S GOINGTHE OTHER
5529,LIGHT,LIGHT
5530,OKAY,OKAY
5531,THAN IT WOULD WORK BECAUSE IF IT WAS JUST AT THE BA ARE THE TWO BASES OF BULB AROUND LIGHTS MUST GO UP THE LIGHT BULB SO I WERE WORK EASIER,THEN IT WOULDN'T WORK BECAUSE IF IT WAS JUST AT THE BA O THE TWO BASES OF THE BULB THEN IT WOULDN'T WORK ECAUSE THE WIRES PLUS TO GO UP THE LIGHT BULB SO IT WOULDN'T WORK EASIER
5532,THE TWO WIRES ARE CONNECTED TO THE NEGATIVE AND POSITVIE SIDE AND THEN THE NEGATIVE GOES TO THE SIDE OF THE METAL OF LIGHT BULB AND THEN POSITVE SIDE GOES UP IN LIGHT BULBS ARE PRODUCES THE ELECTRICITY THROUGH THE LIGHT BULB,THE TWO WIRES ARE CONNECTED TO THE NEGATIVE AND POSITIVE SIDE AND THEN THTHE NEGATIVE GOES TO THE SIDE OF THE MIDDLE OF THE LIGHT BULB AND THEN THE POSITIVE SIDE GOES UP AND THE LIGHT BULB SOIT PRODUCES THE ELECTRICITY THROUGH THE LIGHT BULB
5533,I'M GOOD,I'M GOOD
5534,THE ELECTRICITY,HEELECTRICITY
5535,TWO WIRES HAVE TO BE CONNECTED TO MAKE A COMPLETE CIRCUIT,TWO WIRES HAVE TO BE CONNECTED TO ATO MAKE A COMPLETE CIRCUIT
5536,IT HAS TO TAKE A PATH WHEN YOU COLLECT IT,IT HAS TO MAKE A PATH WHEN YOU CONLLECT IT
5537,COMPLETE CIRCUITS,COMPLETE CIRCUITS
5538,IT LIGHT UP LIKE IN HER ON A LAMP ELECTRICITY GOES THROUGH AND IT GOES THROUGH UP AND THEN STILL MAKE US BACK UP,IT LIGHTS UP LIKE IN HER ON A LAMP ELECTRICITY GOES THROUGH AND THEN IT GOES UP AND THEN A BOOM IT GOES BACK UP
5539,BOTH SIDE,BOTH SIDE
5540,IT AS HOW YOU ELECTRICITY WAS TO WIRES,IT HAS TO HAVE ELECTRICITY WITH TWO WIRES
5541,THAT THERE IS LIKE THE ELECTRICITY THE LIGHT BULB,THAT THERE'S ALWAYS THE ELECTRICITY FLOWING THROUGH TITTL LIGHT BULB
5542,ELECTRICITY,ELECTRICITY
5543,ITS NEGATIVE IN POSITIVE SIDE CONNECTED TO LIGHT BULB,IT'S THE NEGATIVE AND POSITIVE SIDE CONNECTED TO THE LIGHT BULB
5544,I NOTICED THAT THE FLIP THIS THAT SHOULD I NOTICED THAT IF YOU'D PUT PUT IT TO THE NOT THE NEGATIVE SIDE THEY WILL GO UP THAT WAY BUT THE PEOPLE ON THE POSITIVE SIDE THEN YOU KNOW GO THE SAME WAY THAT IT WAS IN THE BEGIN,I NOTICED THA IF YOU FLIP IT TH TEI NOTICED THAT IF YOU PUT PUT IT TO THE  NEGATIVE SIDE THEN IT WIL GO T OPPOSITE WAY BUT IF YOU PUT IT ON THE POSITIVE SIDE THEN IT WILL GO THE SAME WAY THAT IT WAS IN THE BIGGE
5545,ITS FLOWING THROUGHT THE LIGHT BULB AND TO THE POSITIVE SIDE,IT'S FLOWING THROUGH THE LIGHT BULB INTO THE POSITIVE SIDE
5546,ELECTRICITY,ELECTRICITY
5547,IF THE CIRCUIT,IT'S A
5548,DO YOU THINK ELECTRICITY,ING ELECTRICITY
5549,THE TWO WIRES ARE CONNECTED AND THE METAL IS TOUCHING,THAT TWO WIRES ARE CONNECTED AND THE MEDAL IS TOUCHING
5550,THEY SEE A LATER,SEE A LATER
5551,BATTERY LIGHT BULB AND WIRE,BATTERY LIGHT BULB AND WIRES
5552,I DON'T KNOW,I DON'T KNOW
5553,THE NEGATIVE,THE NEGATIVE
5554,ELECTRICITY,ELECTRICITY
5555,THAT THEY CAN CONNCET TO EACH OF THEM BUT IF THERE IF THE TWO WIRES BOTH AT THE BASE OF THE SIDE OF THE LIGHT BULB IT GOING TO LIGHT UP HAS IT DOESN'T KNOW,THAT THEY CAN CONNECT TO EACH OF THEM BUT IF THEY WERE IF THE TWO WIRES WERE BOTH AT THE BASE OF THE SIDE OF THE LIGHT BULB IT WOULDN'T LIGHT UP AS IT DOES NOW
5556,THE PLY IS THAT IT HAS TO BE TOUCHING METAL WITH THE TWO WIRES AS WE TOUCHING THE LIGHT BULB THEN ORDER OF TWO,THE POINT IS THAT IT HAS TO BE TOUCHING METAL WITH THE TWO WIRES HAS TO BE TOUCHING THE LIGHT BULBS IN ORDER FOR IT TO LIGHT IP
5557,THE REALLY THROUGH THE WIRES INTO THE LIGHT BULB BACK INTO THE ONE POSITIVE,THROUGH IT THROUGH THE WIRES INTO THE LIGHT BULB BACK INTO THEPOSITIVE
5558,YEAH,YEAH

8491,ALL INSIDE IT AND THEN IT WANT,INSIDE IT AND THEN IT WON'T
8492,I MEAN THAT IS NOT GETTING ENERGY BECAUSE THE SWITCH IS AT ON AND THE WOOD STICK IS LIKE ISN'T A TYPE OF METAL SO IT WON'T WORK,IT MEANS THAT IT'S NOT GETTING ENERGY BECAUSE THE SWITCH ISN'T ON AND THE WEOD STICK ISN'T LIKE ISN'T A TYPE OF METAL SO  IT WON'T WORK
8493,CONDUCTING MATERIALS ARE HELPFUL BUT THE REST OF THAT AREN'T WHERE IT'S TO OTHER WAY OVER CAN YOU TELL THAT MARNIE,CONDUCTING MATERIALS OR HELPFU BUT THE REST OF THEM AREN'T OR IT'S THE OTHER WAY AROUND CAN YOU TOEL ME THAT MARNIE
8494,THAT WHEN YOU PUT THE WOOD ON THE WOOD STICK IT IS NOT WORKING ANYMORE BECAUSE IT'S NOT TYPE OF METAL OR ITS TYPE OF SOURCE TO MAKE IT,THAT WHEN YOU PUT THE WOOD WOOD THE WOOD STICK IT ISN'T WORKING ANYMORE BECAUSE IT'S NOT A TYPE OF METAL ORA TYPE OF SOURCE TO MAKE IT
8495,IT DOESN'T WORK BECAUSE IT'S NOT LIKE STORE OF ENERGY AND BECAUSE A BATTERY WORKS BECAUSE THAT HAS STORED ENERGY INSIDE IT SO,IT DOESN'T WORK BECAUSE IT'S NOT A SORE OF ENERGY IN  BECAUS A BATTERY WORKS BECAUSE IT HAS STORED ENERGY INSIDE IT SO
8496,I SAID THAT YOU NEED A BATTERY WHICH HAS STORED ENERGY INSIDE IT AND THEN YOU NEED TWO WIRES A SWITCH AND A MOTOR,I SAID THAT YOU NEED A BATTERY WHICH HAS STOLED ENERGY INSIDE IT AND THEN YOU NEED TWO WIRES A SWITCH AND A MOTOR
8497,WELL I THINK THAT THE LIGHT THE DOTS ARE THE ENERGY AND LIKE THAT'S WAS JUST SPEAKING THE LIGHT BULB BRIGHTER,WELL I THINK THAT THE LIKETHE DOTS ARE THE ENERGY AND LIKE THATS WHAS MAKING THE LIGHT BULB RIGHTER
8498,IT'S JUST TO BE IN A CIRCLE IS VERY HELPFUL BECAUSE THEY HAS BECAUSE THE BATTERY IS GIVING IN ENERGY TO THE D CELL THAT'S HOW THE LIGHT BULB IS GETTING THE ENERGY IMPROVEMENT,ELECTRICITY IN A CIRCUIT IS VERY HELPFUL BECAUSE IT HAS BECAUSE IT THE BATTERYIS GIVING  ENERGY TO THE D CELL ND THAT'S HOW THE THO LIGHT BULB IS GETTING THE ENERGY N FORMT
8499,I DON'T KNOW,I DON'T KNOW
8500,THAT WHEN THOSE ONE LIGHT BULB IT JUST ONE FOCUS AND LIKE WHEN THERE IS A ONE BATTERY IT DOESN'T LIGHT AS MUCH AS THE SECOND ONE BECAUSE THERE IS TWO FOR EACH ONE,WHEN THERE'S ONE LIGHT BULB IT'S JUST ONE FOAUS AND LIKE WHEN THERE'S ONE BATTERY IT DOESN'T LIGHT AS MUCH AS THE SECOND ONE BECAUSE THERE'S STUFOR EACH ONE
8501,ITS IT WAS THE LIGHT BULBS TURN BRIGHTER BECAUSE IT'S USING TWO BATTERIES AND SO THAT IS TWO STORED ENERGIES INTO LIGHT BULBS,IT IT WAS THE LIGHT BULBS TURNED BRIGHTER BECAUSE IT'S USING TWO BATTERIES AND SO THAIS TWO STORED ENERGIES IN TWO LIGHT BULBS
8502,THERE ARE ONE TWO THREE FOUR THERE IS FOUR PATH WAYS TO A SERIES CIRCUIT,THERE ARE ONE TWO THREE FOUR THERE'S FOUR PATHWAYS TO A SERIUS CIRCUIT
8503,I THINK THE WORK MAY BE,I THINK I'LL WORK MAYBE
8504,THE ENERGY STORED IN THAT BECAUSE IT'S GIVING ENERGY TO THE LIGHT BULBS,THE ENERGY IS STOWARED AND STUFF BECAUSE IT'S GIVING ENERGY TO THE LIGHT BULBS
8505,I THINK THE LIGHT BULBS ARE GOING TO BE BRIGHTER BECAUSE IT'S USING TO TUBE A D CELLS AND LIKE THEY HAVE STORED ENERGY SO IT WILL WORK,I THINK THE LIGHT BULBS ARE GONTO BE BRIGHTER BECAUSE IT'S USING T TOD CELLS AND LIKE THEY HAVE SORTO ENERGY SO IT WILL WORK
8506,CAN YOU REPEAT THAT,CAN YOU
8507,FLOW IN LIKE THE BATTERY AND IT HAS TO HAS TO GO THROUGH THE LIGHT BULB THE WIRES THE D CELL AS TO GO THROUGH LIGHT HAS TO GO THROUGH IT HAS LOT OF THINGS,FLOW IN LIKE THE BATTERY AND IT HAS TO GO THROUGH IT HAS TO GO THROUGH THE LIGHT BULB THE WIRES THE D CELL  HAS TO GO THROUGH LIGHT IT HAS TO GO THROUGH AIR IT HAS TO GO THROUGH A LOT OF THINGS
8508,I THINK THAT IS THE WIRE IS GETTING ENERGY AND ITS GOING INTO THE LIGHT BULBS SO THE LITTLE BLUE DOTS ARE LIKE THE ENERGY COMING,I THINK THAT IS THE THE WIRES GETTING ENERGY AND IT'S GOING INTO THE LIGHT BULB SO THE LITTLE BLUE DOTS ARE LIKE THE ENERGY COMING
8509,IT'S TO BE TOUCHING D CELL AND THE WIRES BECAUSE THE WIRES ARE GOING TO GAIN ENERGY AND BY THAT ONE IS GOING TO BE LIKE A REALLY FUN AND STUFF LIKE THAT SO JUST GET ON THE LAST PART,HAS TO BE TOUCHING D CELL AND THE WIRES BECAUSE THE WIRES ARE GOINA HELP IT GET ENERGY AND BY THA FORM IT'S GON TO BE LIKE REALLY FUN AND STUFF I GUES I JUST GUESSED ON THE LESS PART
8510,BECAUSE THEY NEEDS ANOTHER WIRE CONNECTING TO THE PLUS OF THE WIRES AND THERE ARE NOT SUPPOSED TO BE TOUCHING,BECAUSE IT NEEDS ANOTHER WIRE CONNECTING TO THE PLUS OF THE WIRES AND THEY ARE'T SUPPOSED TO BE TOUCHING
8511,CONNECTING THE SERIES CIRCUIT LIKE IT WOULD NOT BE THE BRIGHT ANYMORE WELL IT WILL BE BRIGHT BECAUSE IT'S ONLY USED I THINK IT WON'T WORK AND I THINK REALLY WORK LIGHT BULBS,THINK THE SERIES CIRCUIT LIKE ITIT WOULD NOT BE THAT BRIGHT ANYMORE WHEL IT WILL BE BRIGHT BECAUSE IT'S ONLY USE I THINK IT WON'T WORK ANDI  IT WILL WORK BUT THE LIGHT BULB WON'T
8512,MAY BE BECAUSE IF THE WIRES ARE THE BATTERY IS GIVING ENERGY TO THE WIRE AND THAT'S WHY THE LIGHT BULB IS SHINING AND ITS VERY VERY VERY VERY BRIGHT,UMAYBE BECAUSE IF THE WIRES ARE THE BATTERYIS GIVING ENERGY TO THE WIRES AND THAT'S WHY THE LIGHT BULB IS SHINING AND IT'S VERY VERY VERY VEYU RIGHT
8513,HE IS A COMPLETE FORMAT FOR A LIGHT BULB TO WORK,IT IS A COMPLETE FORMAT FOR A LIGHT BULB TO WORK
8514,IT'S LIKE THE ENERGY IS GIVING THE ENERGY IT'S CALLED TO THE LIGHT BULB AND THAT'S HOW ITS GIVING ENERGY I GUESS,IT'S LIKE THE ENERGY IS GIVING THE ENERGY IT'S GOT TO THE LIGHT BULB AND THAT'S HOW IT'S DOING ENERGY I GUESS

11845,I THINK WHAT THAT IS ALL ABOUT IS MEASURING IT AND SEEING HOW FAR IT GOES,I THINK WHAT THAT IS ALL ABOUT IS MEASURING IT AND SEEING HOW FAR IT GOES
11846,I THINK WHAT'S GOING ON THERE IT MAKES A GOOD FLIPPER SYSTEM BECAUSE IT BOUNCES OFF AND IT HOLDS IT TIGHT AND YOU DON'T WANT TO BOUNCE IT OFF THAT HIGH BECAUSE THE THE STICK CAN BREAK,I THINK WHAT'S GOING ON THERE IT MAKES IT A SLOPER SYSTEM BECAUSE IT BOUNCES OFF AND IT HOLDS IT TIGHT AND YOU KNOW ONE  BOUNCE IT OFF THAT HIGHT BECAUSE IT SICK CAN BREAK
11847,I'M VERY GOOD,I'M VERY GOOD
11848,YOU CAN ALSO UM DO A SMALLER STICK AND SEE YEAH YOU CAN DO THAT TOO,YOU CAN ALSO UM DO A SMALLER STICK AND TO SEE YEA YOU CAN DO THAT TOO
11849,WHEN YOU CLICK IT IT BOUNCES OFF,WHEN YOU CLICK IT IT BOUNCES OFF
11850,THESE ARE ALL ABOUT MEASURING HOW FAR THE BROOK GOES AND SEEING IF IT GOES THAT FAR,THESE OBJECTS ARE ALL ABOUT MEASURING HOW FAR THE BROOK GOES AND SEEING IF IT GOES THAT FAR
11851,I FOUND OUT THAT YOU GET YOU'RE MEASURING IT AND THAT YOU'RE SEEING HOW FAR THE BROOK GOES AND IF IT DOESN'T GO THAT FAR YOU PUT THE CAPACITY YOU WRITE THE CAPACITY AND YOU,I FOUND OUT THAT YOU GET YOU'RE MEASURING  AND THAT YOU'RE SEEING HOW FAR THE BROK GOES AND IF IT DOESN'T GO THAT FAR YOU PUT THE CAPACITY YOU WRITE THE CAPACITY AND YOU
11852,UM YOU CAN FLIP,YOU CAN DO THIS EXPERIMENT YOU CAN DO
11853,UM YOU CAN THINK OF,UM YOU CAN THINK OF
11854,I THINK WHAT THE BASE IS ALL ABOUT IS MEASURING IT AND LIKE SEEING IF IT GOES FAR,I THINK WHAT THE BASE IS ALL ABOUT IS MEASURING IT AND LIKE SEEING IF IT GOES FAR
11855,I THINK WHAT IS UP WITH THAT OBJECT WOULD BE UM SEEING HOW FAR IT GOES MAYBE,AN I THINK WHAT IS UP WITH THAT OBJECT WOULD BE UM SEEING HOW FAR IT GOS MAYBE
11856,UM YOU CAN THE BLOCK THAT HOLDS THE STICK IT CAN BE SMALLER OR IT CAN BE HEAVIER,UM YOU CAN THE BLOCK THAT HOLDS THE STICK IT CAN BE SMALLER OR IT CAN BE HEAVIER
11857,THERE IS SOMETHING ON THE ON TOP OF IT AND THAT YOU HOLD IT YOU PUT IT UNDER THE BLOCK AND YOU JUST FLIP IT AND YOU SEE HOW FAR IT GOES,THERE IS SOMETHING ON THE ONTHE TOP OF IT AND THET YOU HOLD IT YOU PUT IT UNDER THE BLOCK AND YOU JUST FLIP IT AND YOU SEE HOW FAR IT GOES
11858,IT CONNECTS IT BY PUTTING THE STICK ON THE BOTTOM OF THE BRICK AND IF IT GOES FAR YOU JUST PUSH IT IN YOU JUST TAKE IT OUT AND IT'S AND THEN JUST PUT IT,IT CONNECTS IT BY PUTTING THE STICK ON THE BOTTOM OF THE BRICK AND IF IT GOES FAR YOU JUST PUSH IT IN YOU JUST TAKE IT OUT AND IT'S AND THENYOU JUST PUT IT
11859,SPINNING THE RUBBERBAND AROUND AND SEEING HOW HOW FAR IT GOES,I THINK IT IS ALL ABOUT
11860,SYSTEMS ARE ALL ABOUT MEASURING AND DOING SEEING SEEING WHAT HOW THE SYSTEM LOOKS,SYSTEMS ARE ALL ABOUT MEASURING AND DOI SAING SEEING WHA HOW THE SYSTEM LOOKS
11861,WHAT'S GOING ON WITH THAT IS THAT WE HAVE TO LEARN ABOUT PENDULUMS WE HAVE TO LEARN HOW TO P HOW TO DO SCIENCE AND AND TO LEARN MORE THINGS,WAT'S GOING ON WITH THAT IS THAT WE HAVE TO LEARN ABOUT PENDULUMS WE HAVE TO LEARN HOW TO PU HOW TO DO SCIENCE AND AND TO LEARN MORE THINGS
11862,NO SOME OF THEM HOLD TEN OR NINE,NOLL SOME OF THEM HOLD TEN OR NINE
11863,VERY WELL,T'S VERY WELL
11864,YOU CAN BUILD THEM OUT OF LIFEBOATS YOU CAN BUILD THEM OUT OF WOOD,YOU CAN BUILLD THEM OUT OF LIFEBOATS YOU CAN BUILD THEM OUT OF WOOD
11865,LEARN ABOUT O,LEARNG ABOUT OH
11866,I I THINK I'M NOT SURE I THINK YOU HAVE TO MEASURE THIRTY CENTIMETERS ON THEM AND WE LEARNED HOW TO HOW MANY PENDULUMS THAT IT CAN HOLD AND HOW MUCH WATER IT CAN HOLD,I I THINK I'M NOT SURE I THINK YOU HAVE TO MEASURE THIRTY CENTIMETERS ON THEM AND WE LEARNED HOW TO HOW MANY PENDULUMS THAT IT CAN HOLD AND HOW MUCH WATER IT CAN HOLD
11867,ABOUT ELEVEN AND C COULD HAVE TEN AND THE SHORTEST ONE COULD HAVE EIGHT,ABOUT ELEVEN AND C COULD HAVE TEN AND THE SHORTEST ONE COUL HAVE EIGHT
11868,I THINK IT COULD CONNECT TO THE CAPACITY OF THE BOAT WOULD BE WE CAN JUST MEASURE MEASURE EM AND IT CAN BE EIGHTY MILLIMETERS OR SIXTY TWO MILLIMETERS THIRTY EIGHT FIFTY FIVE MILLIMETERS,I THINK IT COULD CONNECT TO THE CAPACITY OF THE BOAT WOULD BE WE CAN JUST MEASURE MEASURE IM AND IT CAN BE EIGHTY MILLIMETERS OR SIXTY TWO MILLIMETERS THIRTY EIGHT FIFTY FIVE MILLIMETERS
11869,BYE,BYE
11870,I'VE BUILT MINE OUT OF PA OUT OF PAPER CUPS,I BUILT MINE OUT OF P OUT OF PAPER CUPS
11871,FIRST YOU HAVE TO MEASURE A THE BOAT AND SEE AND PUT IT IN THE WATER AND YOU I THINK YOU MEASURE THIRTY CENTIMETERS ON THEM AND THEN YOU'D NEED TO,FIRST YOU HAVE TO MEASURE UP THE BOAT AND CEE AND PUT IT IN THE WATER AND YOU I THINK YOU MEASURE THIRTY CENTIMETERS ON THEM AND THEN YOUD NEED TO
11872,WHY I THINK THEY GOT A DIFFERENT NUMBER OF PENNIES IS BECAUSE THEY CUTTED THEM SHORTER OR LONGER,WHY I THINK THEY GOT A DIFFERENT NUMBER OF PENNIECES BECAUSE THEY CATED THEM SHORTER OR LONGER
11873,I WOULD THINK ABOUT PUTTING PENNIES IN IT OR WATER,I WOULD THINK ABOUT PUTTING PENNIES IN IT OR WATER
11874,I DISCOVERED THAT THE BOAT CAN FIT TWELVE TWELVE PENDULUMS IN THE LITTLE BOAT,I DISCOVERED THAT THE BOAT CAN FIT TWELVE TWELVE PENDULUMS AND IN THE LITTLE BOAT
11875,WHEN I WHEN I NOTICED THAT A WASN'T DROWNING THAT MUCH I STARTED PUTTING MORE AND MORE UH PENDULUMS IN EM AND WHEN I DROWNED IT I I GOT MY ANSWER REALLY EASILY,WHEN I  WHEN I NOTICED THAT A WASN'T DROUNNING THAT MUCH I STARTED PUTTING MORE AND MORE PENDULUMS IN HIM AND WHEN I DROUNDID I I GOT MY ANSWER REALLY EASILY
11876,WE HAVE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT BOATS AND WE HAVE BEEN PUTTING PENDULUMS IN THE BOATS AND SEEING HOW MANY PENDULUMS CAN FIT INSIDE THE LITTLE BOAT,WE HAVE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT BOATS AND WE HAVE BEEN PUTTING PENDULUMS IN THE BOATS AND SEEING HOW MANY PENDULUMS CAN FIHT INSIDE THE LITTLE BOAT
11877,WE,WE
11878,THE LIFEBOATS ARE ALL ABOUT YOU GO YOU CAN GO ON A ROMANTIC DATE YOU CAN,UM GO TO THE RIVER AND GET ON THEM YOU CAN HAVE A PIGNECK IN THEM
11879,WHAT IS GOING ON THERE IS THE PROPELLER IS THE STRING IS MAKING IT BALANCE IT AND IT KEEPS GOING AROUND AND AROUND PROPELLER KEEPS GOING AROUND AND AROUND,WHAT IS GOING ON THERE IS THE PROPELLER IS  THE STRING IS MICKING IT BALANCE IT AND IT KEEPS GOING AROUND AND AROUND THE PERPLE THAT KEEPS GOING AROUND AND AROUND
11880,I THINK IT WILL BECAUSE IT HAS TO HAVE MORE POWER ON IT AND IT HAS TO GO UP FARTHER AND I THINK THAT WOULD AFFECT IT,I THINK IT WILL BECAUSE IT HAS TO HAVE MORE POWER ON IT AND IT HAS TO GO UP FARTHER AND I THINK THAT WOULD AFFECT IT
11881,SO IT HAS ALSO BEEN NICE TALKING TO YOU MARTY,SO IT HAS ALSO BEEN NICE TALKING TO YOU MARNIE
11882,WHAT WE'VE BEEN DOING IN SCIENCE WE WERE WE HAVE BEEN DOING AIRPLANES WE HAVE BEEN SEEING IS THE AIRPLANE PROPELLER CAN FLY,WHAT'V WE'VE BEEN DOING IN SCIENCE WE WERE WE HAVE BEEN DOING AIRPLANES ND WE HAVE BEEN SEEING IF THE AIRPLANE PROPELLER CAN FLY
11883,THANK YOU,THANK YOU
11884,THANK YOU,THANK YOU
11885,I THINK WHEN SETTING UP YOUR MY EXPERIMENT WAS IT WAS TRICKY TO PUT IT TOGETHER BUT IT WORKED REALLY WELL AND,I THINK ONE' SETTING UP ER MY EXPERIMENT WAS IT WAS TRICD  PUT IT TOGETHER BUT IT WORKED REALLY WELL AND
11886,IT'S GOING VERY WELL MARTY,I'S GOING VERY WELL MARNIE
11887,YOU CAN ALSO CHANGE THE PROPELLER YOU CAN USE FISHING YOU CAN USE FISHING WIRE AND YOU CAN MAKE THE PROPELLER SMALLER YOU CAN MAKE THE THE,YEAH
11888,YOU,YOU
11889,OKAY SO HOW MANY SPINS IT TAKES SPINS ARE FORTY FIVE SPINS IT MADE AND THE DISTANCE IS HOW MUCH METER HOW MUCH METERS YOU MEASURE IT,OKAY SA HOW MANY SPINS IT TAKES SPINS ARE FORTY FIVE SPINS IT MADE IN THE DISTANE IS HOW MUCH METER HOW MUCH METERS YOU MEASURE IT
11890,SO WHAT THE PARTS OF THE PLANE I USE THE PROPELLER IS MAKING IT SPIN AND THE STRING THE STRAW AND THE STRING IS MAKING IT BALANCE IT,SO WHAT THE PARTS OF THE PLANE ARE USED THE PROPELLER IS MAKING IT SPIN AND THE STRING THE STRAW IN THE STRING IS MAKING IT BALANCE IT
11891,I THINK THE KINDS OF THINGS THAT ARE IMPORTANT WHAT MAKES IF FLY IS THE PROPELLER MAKES IT FLY AND THAT THE STRING IS BALANCED AND A AND THAT THE STRAW IS GREAT IS PUT GOOD ON IT,I THINK THE KINDS OF THINGS THAT ARE IMPORTANT WHAT MAKES IT FLY IS A PROPELLEAR MIXKES IT FLY AND THAT THE STRING IS BALANCE AND A AND THAT THE STRAW IS GR IS PUT GOOD ON IT
11892,I THINK WHAT THAT IS ALL ABOUT IT MAKES THE PROPELLER SPIN AND IF WE DON'T HAVE THE RUBBER BAND IN THE BOTTOM IT'S NOT GOING TO WORK,I THINK WHAT THAT IS ALL ABOUT IT MAKES THE PROPELLER SPIN AND IF YOU DODN'T HAVE THE RUBBER ROUND THE BOTTOM IT'S NOTE ONGNA WORK
11893,YOU HAVE TO THE PROPELLER IS ALL ABOUT MAKING THE PROPELLER SPIN,YOU HAVE TO  THE PROPELLER IS ALL ABOUT MAKING THE PROPELLER SPIN
11894,WHEN IT SPINS THE THING ON THE BOTTOM SPINS AROUND TOO WITH IT AND M AND THEN YOU MEASURE HOW MUCH FAR IT WENT,WHEN IT SPINS THE THING ON THE BOTTOM SPINS AROUND TO WITH IT AND A AND THEN YOU MEASURE HOW MUCH FAR IT WENT
11895,I THINK THE NUMBER OF SWINGS ISN'T RIGHT BECAUSE YOU HA ALSO THE STRING HAS TO BE BALANCED AND THE PROPELLER HAS TO BE MOVING,I THINK THE NUMBER OF SWINGS IS IN RIGHT BECAUSE YOU HA ALSO THE STRING HAS TO BE BALANCE AND THE PROPELLER HAS TO BE MOVING
11896,WITH STRING,STRING
11897,THANK YOU,THANK YOU
11898,MARNIE,BARTIE
11899,I THINK WHAT IS IMPORTANT ABOUT THE FLYING LINE IS BECAUSE AND IT ATTACHES TO IT AND IT MAKES IT BALANCE AND IF E YOU DON'T HAVE IT ON THE BOTTOM IT'S GONNA NOT GO THAT FAST,I THINK WHAT IS IMPORTANT ABOUT THE FLAYAN LINE IS BECAUSE AN IT ATTACHES TO IT AND THET MAKES IT BALANCE AND IFE YOU DON'T HAVE IT ON THE BOTTOM IT'S GONNA NOT GO THAT FAST
11900,OKAY,KAY
11901,WHAT YOU CAN ALSO DO WHEN THE PARTS ARE ALL WORKING TOGETHER IS YOU CAN PUT THE STRING INTO THE STRAW AND THEN YOU CAN JUST SWING IT ACROSS AND IT BALANCE IT AND IF IT DOESN'T BALANCE IT'S GOING TO WIGGLE A LOT,WELL YOU CAN HAVE TO DO WHEN THE PARTS ARE ALL WORKING TOGETHER IS YOU CAN PUT THE STRING INTO THE STRAW AND THEN YOU CAN JUST SWING IT ACROSS AND IT BALANCE IT AND IF YOUT DOESN'T BALANCE IT'S GONNA WEIGH GO LOP
11902,OKAY,OKAY
11903,I THINK THAT IF THE STRING ISN'T BALANCED THAT WELL IT'S NOT GONNA WORK IT'S NOT GONNA SPIN IT'S IT'S IT'S JUST NOT GONNA WORK,I THINK THAT IF THE STRING ISM BALANCED THAT WELL IT'S NOT GONNA WORK IT'S NOT GONNA SPIN IT'SS IT'S JUST NOT GONNA WORK
11904,YEAH THAT'S IT,THE PROPELLER ON IT AND THEN YOU NEED TO JUST STABLE THE TWO OTHER OTHER UM
11905,I AM VERY WELL HOW ARE YOU MARNIE,I MIR WELL HOW ARE YOU MARNIE
11906,I THINK THE OTHER THINGS THAT ARE IMPORTANT WHEN YOU ARE FLYING YOUR PLANE IS THAT IT'S REALLY BALANCED AND IT'S NOT WIGGLING A LOT AND THAT YOUR PROPELLER SPINS,I THINK THE OTHER THINGS THAT ARE IMPORTANT WHEN YOU'RE FLYING YOU'RE PLANT IS THAT IT'S REALLY BALANCE AND IT'S NOT WHEN BIGGING A LOT AND THAT YOU PROPELLER SPINS
11907,I THINK THE PROPELLERS ARE ALL ABOUT I AM GUESSING THAT THE PROPELLERS ARE TO KEEP IT BALANCED,I THINK THE PROPELLERS ARE ALL ABOUT I AM GUESSING THAT THE PROPELLERS OR TO KEEP IT BALANCE
11908,ME TOO,ME TWO
11909,UM WELL MAYBE IT'S YOU HAVE TO PUT THE AIRPLANE HANGING ATTACHED TO A STRING AND YOU HAVE TO SEE HOW IF IT CAN FLY,UM WELL MAYBE IT'S YOU HAVE TO PUT THE AIRPLANE HANGI ATTACHED TO A STRING AND YOU HAVE TO SEE HOW IF IT CAN FLY
11910,BYE IT'S BEEN NICE TALKING TO YOU TOO,BY IT'S BEEN NICE TALKING TO YOU TOO
11911,I THINK HOW I MIGHT AFFECT IT IS BECAUSE THE SECOND ONE ISN'T REALLY WELL DONE AND IF IT GOES UP IT'S GONNA GO BACK DOWN AND THE FIRST ONE IS GONNA KEEP GOING STRAIGHT,I THINK HOW I MIGHT AFFECT IT IS BECAUSE THE SECOND ONE ISN'T REALLY WELL DONE AND IF IT GOES UP IT'S GONNA GO BACK DOWN AND THE FIRST ONE IT'S GONNA KEEP GOING STRAIGHT
11912,I THINK IT'S BALANCING IT AND IT'S MAKING THE AIRPLANE FLY,I THINK IT'S BALANCING IT AND IT'S MAKING THE AIRPLANE FLY
11913,THANK YOU,HONK YO
11914,THE STRING WAS ALL ABOUT SEEING HOW FAST THE AIRPLANE COULD H FLY AND THE STRING,THE STRING WAS ALL ABOUT SEEING HOW FAST THE AIRPLAINE COULD HAVELY AND THE STRING
11915,I THINK WHAT THAT WAS ALL ABOUT WAS,I THINK WHAT THAT WAS ALL ABOUT WAS
11916,IT CAN STAY A MAGNET AS UM FOR A BIT LONGER THAN IT CAN STICK TO THE MAGNET BUT IT LOSES ITS MAGNETISM,IT CAN STAY IN MAGNET I UM FOR A BIT LONGER THAN IT CAN STICK TO THE MAGNET BUT IT LOSES IT'S MAGNETISM
11917,THE MAGNET RUBBING THE NAIL WILL GIVE SOME MAGNETISM TO THE NAIL SO IT CAN PICK UP THE PAPER CLIP,THE MAGNET RUBBING THE NAILWILL GIVE SOME MAGNETISM TO THE NAIL SO IT CAN PICK UP THE PAPER CLIP
11918,THEY CAN GO THROUGH THIN OBJECTS AND ALSO THEY CAN CONNECT TO EACH OTHER WHEN THEY'RE OFF BUT THE MAGNETISM IS SO STRONG BETWEEN THE TWO MAGNETS THAT IT CAN PULL THROUGH THE TABLE,THEY CAN GO THROUGH THIN OBJECTS AND ALSO THEY CAN CONNECT TO EACH OTHER WHEN THEY ARE OFF BUT THE MAGNETISM IS SO STRONG BETWEEN THE TWO MAGNETS THAT IT CAN PULL THROUGH THE TABLE
11919,THIS MAGNET THAT WE'RE SHOWING HERE HAS BEEN CONNECTED CAUSE THE PAPER IS VERY THIN,THIS MAGNET THAT WE'RE SHOWING HERE HAS BEEN CONNECTED BCAUSE THE PAPER IS VERY THIN
11920,THE MAGNET CA IS LIFTING UP THE NAIL THAT IS SENDING ELECTRONS TO THE TO THE PAPER CLIP,THE MAGNET C IS LIFTING UP THE NAIL THAT IS SENDING ELECTROIITYS TI TO THE FAVORCLIP
11921,IF YOU DO NOT HAVE THE STRONGEST MAGNETISM IN YOUR MAGNET IT CANNOT GET THROUGH THICKER THINGS,IF YOU DO NOT HAVE THE STRONGEST MAGNETISM IN YOUR MAGNET IT CANNOT GET THROUGH THICKER THINGS
11922,NAIL PICKED UP THE NAIL PICKED UP THE PAPER CLIP BUT THEN IT LOST ITS MAGNETISM AND THEN AND THEN THE MAGNET CAME BACK TO GIVE IT MORE MAGNETISM AND IT COULD PICK UP THE PAPER CLIP AGAIN,NAIL PICKED UP THE NAIL PICKED UP THE PAPER CLIP BUT THEN IT LOSST IT'S MAGNETISM AND THEN AND THEN THE MAGNET CAME BACK TO GIVE IT MORE MAGNETISM AND IT COULD PICK UP THE PAPER CLIP AGAIN
11923,A NAIL HAS SOME MAGNETISM IN IT TO PICK UP THE UM THE PAPER CLIP,THE NAIL HAS THE MAGNETISM IN IT TO PICK UP THE UM THE PAPER CLIP
11924,THE NAIL CAN ONLY S UM STAY LIKE A MAGNET SO LONG BECAUSE CAUSE IT DOES NOT IT CANNOT KEEP AS A MAGNET CAN THE MAGNETISM THAT STAYS IN IT FOREVER,THE NAIL CAN ONLY S UM STAY LIKE A MAGNET SO LONG BECAUSE CAUSE IT DOES NOT IT CANNOT KEEP AS A MAGNET CAN THE MAGNETISM THAT STAYS IN IT FOREVER
11925,THE NAIL IS USING MAGNETISM TO UM KEEP THE PAPER CLIP ON IT BUT THE PAPER CLIP CAN ONLY STAY ON SO LONG CAUSE THE MAGNETISM UM WEARS OFF AFTER A WHILE,THE NAIL IS USING MAGNETISM TO UM KEEP THE PAPER CLIP ON IT BUT THE PAPER CLIP CAN ONLY STAY OND SO LONG CAUSE THE MAGNETISM UM WEARS OFF AFTER A WHILE
11926,WELL MAGNETS CAN STICK TO EACH OTHER BECAUSE THEY BOTH HAVE IRON AND THEY CAN ATTRACT BECAUSE THEY'RE ON DIFFERENT SIDES,WELL MAGNETS CAN STICK TO EACH OTHER BECAUSE THEY BOTH HAVE IRON AND THEY CAN ATTRACT BECAUSE THEY'RE IN DIFFERENT SIDES
11927,THE NAIL CANNOT ALWAYS BE A MAGNET AND THE MAGNET IS ALWAYS A MAGNET,THE NAIL CANNOT ALWAYS BE AN MAGNET AND THE MAGNET IS ALWAYS MAGNET
11928,THE NAIL IS NOT A MAGNET SO IT CAN'T PICK UP THE PAPER CLIP WHEN IT'S NOT CONNECTED TO THE MAGNET,THE NAIL IS NOT A MAGNET SO IT CAN'T PICK UP THE PAPER CLIP WHEN IT'S NOT CONNECTED TO THE MAGNET
