1292,ACTUALLY THE WIND MIGHT ALSO BE HELPING EVAPORATE,ACTUALYTO WIN MI ALSOIL BE HELPING AF THAT PORATE
1293,WELL JUNGLE IS FOR MOISTNESS CAUSE IT HAS MORE RAIN BUT DESERT HAS EVEN IF YOU DID PUT A LITTLE WATER THERE IT'D EVAPORATE REALLY QUICKLY CAUSE THE TEMPERATURE IS SO HOT,WEL JUNGLE IS FUL OF MOISTNESS CAUSE IT HAS MORE BRAIN BUYT DOESERT HAVE EVEN IF YOU DID PU TE WATERTER IN A VAPAAT VEY QUICKLY CAUSE THE TEMPEARTUREIS SO HT
1294,DIFFERENT,IFFERENT
1295,WHEN IT'S WARM IT LOSES MORE BECAUSE UM WHEN IT'S WARM THAT HELPS THE EVAPORATION,WHEN IT I'S WARM IT WOSS MORE BECAUSE UHM WHEN IT'S WARM THAT HELPS E ABOUTPEACON
1296,IT WOULD EASILY COME AND EVAPORATE THE WATER,IT WOULD EASIRLY COME AND A VEPER AT THE WATER
1297,WHEN THE AIR'S FULL OF MOISTURE OR WHEN IT'S HUMID WHEN WELL WHEN THE AIR IS FULL OF MOISTURE IT HAS LESS CHANCE OF EVAPORATING BUT IT'S HUMID IT HAS A WAY BETTER CHANCE OF EVAPORATING,WHEN THE AIR IS F MOR SURE WHEN IT'S HUMID WHEN WHEN THE AIRS FULL OF MOISTURE HAS THE STREEN OF VEPORAN WT'S HUMID IT AS A WAY BETTER CHANCE OF  VEPORATING
1298,UM BECAUSE IT'S PUSHING IT AWAY FROM THE HEAT,UHM BECAUSE IS PUSHING IT AWAY FROM THE HEA
1299,IT EVAPORATES AND SOMETIMES IT MAKES A LITTLE RAIN CLOUD,VAPRRATES AND SOMETIMES IT MAKES A LITTLE GRANCROUD
1300,IT EVAPORATES LESS THAN THE DESERT,IT IVAPRATES WEST THAN A DESERT
1301,WELL CAUSE WELL IT KINDA SLOWS IT DOWN CAUSE IT PUSHES THE WATER AWAY INSTEAD OF BRINGING IT NEARER FOR THE UM TEMPERATURE TO EVAPORATE,WEL  CAUSE WELL IT CND OF SL IS AT DONCAUSE IT PUSHES THE WATER AWAY INSTEADOF BRING IT NEARER FOR T UHM T TEMPEATURE TO A BATOR AIHTS
1302,GOOD THANK YOU,GOO THANK YOU
1303,UM WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT EVAPORATION,I'M LEAVING WARNING ABOUT AVAORAION
1304,WHEN IT'S VERY COOL LIKE TWENTY TWO OR TWENTY DEGREES OR LOWER IT ONLY LOSES ZERO OR ONE MILLILITER,WHEN ITS A VERY GOO WORK TWENTY TWO OR TWENTY DEGREEZE OR ROLER IT ONLY OZE A ZERO OR ONE MILETER
1305,NO I'M TRYING TO SAY THAT MORE WATER EVAPORATES IN A DESERT THAN IT DOES IN A JUNGLE,NO I'M TRYNG TO SAYT MORE WATER THAT BRIDES IN A DESERT THAN AT DOESIN'T A JUNGLE
1306,WELL SINCE YOU YOU CAN MORE SEE THAT B C D UM THAT WELL THE HIGHER THE TEMPERATURE THE MORE WATER LOSS,WELL SINT YOUR ORDMIE YOU CAN MORE SEED AT BE STEEDY UHM THAT WELL THE HIRD HE TEMPEATURE TE MORE WATER WAS
1307,THANK YOU MARNIE SHE'S,THANK YOU MONEY  SHES
1308,WELL THAT'S WEIRD IT'S UM THE TEMPERATURE IS PLUS TWO FOR A AND B THEN IT'S MINUS FIVE FOR B AND C AND THEN IT'S MINUS TWO FOR D AND C,WELL THAT'S WEET ITS UHM DECEMBERTURE IS PUSE TOO FOR A AND B THEN IS MINUS FIVE FOR BEAN CE AN INITS MINUS TOO FR DEN CN
1309,WELL WE PUT EM IN DIFFERENT PLACES TO SEE IF THEY EVAPORATE FASTER,WHL WE PURMIN T RING PLACS THE SEE IF THEY A VAPL RAITE FASTER
1310,WE PUT ONE UP HIGH WHICH IS IN THE CEILING WE PUT ONE BY A COMPUTER WHICH IS NEAR STATIC ELECTRICITY AND WE PUT ONE IN THE FRIDGE WHICH COULD BE HOT OR WARM OR COLD,PUT ONE  PIGH WHICH IS IN THE SEAELING WE PUT ONE BY A COMPUTER WHICH IS THE STATIC OF LECTRICITY AND WE PUT ONE IN FREDGE WHICH COULD BE HOUT OR WARM OR COLD
1311,BYE MARNIE IT WAS VERY GOOD TO SEE YOU AGAIN UM SO UM I HOPE OTHER STUDENTS GET TO HAVE AS MUCH FUN WITH YOU AS I DID BYE SPAGHET SPAGHETTI IS WHAT YOU SAY FOR SPAGHETTI HE HE,BY MORNING IT WAS VERY GOOD TO SEEOU AGAIN UHM SO UHM I HOPE OTHER SOON TO GET THE HOUSAS MAST FRUND  A OU AS I DO BY SATHE CATSPECT CATIS WHAT OURE SAYFORS BUT GETTY HH

1313,THE DROPLET IS SLOWLY GETTING OUT OF THE DROPPER AND DROPPING ON A PENNY WHICH IS GONNA MAKE A BIGGER DOME DOME IS A SCIENTIFIC TERM AND A NORMAL,THE DROP WA IS SLOW WAGING O F THE DROPE AND DROPING THAN A PENY WHICH IS GOING TO MAKE A BIGER DOUN DONT MAKE A SCIENTIFIC TURM AND A NORMAL
1314,SURFACE TENSION IS WHEN UM IS WHEN WATER FORMS TOGETHER TO MAKE A SHAPE LIKE A DOME OR UM SOME OTHER SHAPE,SERVOUS ATENTION IS WHEN  IS WHEN WATER FORMS TOGEVHER TO MAKE A SHAPE LIKE A DOME O AM SN THA A SHAPE
1315,UM IT MAKES UH FORM A SMALL BALL BECAUSE ALL THE WATER GATHERS TOGETHER,UHM IT MAKES A FORM A SMALL BALL BECAUSE ALL THE WALTER GETERS TOGETHER
1316,THE WATER DROPS ALL JOIN TOGETHER IN ONE BIG OBJECT AND UM YEAH SO THAT'S PRETTY MUCH WHAT IT IS BASIC,THE WATER DROPS ALL DURING TOGETHER IN ONE BIG OBJECT AND UHM YEH SO IT ES PETY MUCH WHAT IT IS  S
1317,HYDRONE AND OXYGEN ARE MIXING AND MORE WATER IS GATHERING TOGETHER,HI JONAN AGIN ARE MEINE AND MORE WATER IS GATHELING TOGETHER
1318,UM GOOD THANK YOU,UM GOOD THANK YOU
1319,WELL COLD WATER IS MAKING IT MOVE DOWN BUT OR SOUTH BUT HOT WATER IS MAKING IT MOVE NORTH OR UP,IL COLD WATER IS MAKEING IT MOVE DOWN BA OR SOUTH BUT HOT WATER IS MAKE IT IMOVE NORTH OR U
1320,THANK YOU,DANK YOU
1321,COLD,
1322,CORK AND CORK UM THE CORK AND UH SO IT ABSORBS THE WATER THROUGH THE GLASS AND IT DOESN'T SPILL,CORK AND KWORK UHM THE CORK AND A SO IT ABSORBS THA WATER FUD AL GRAS AND IT DOESN'T SPILL
1323,UM ROOM TEMPERATURE IS THE TEMPERATURE OF THE ROOM,UM WOOND TEMPEATURE S THE TEMPEATURE OF THE RAM
1324,THANK YOU,DANKIO
1325,IT GOES NORTH OR UP CAUSE THE WATER IS MAKING IT GO UP THE HEAT ACTUALLY UM YEAH SO YEAH BASICALLY,THE GOES NORTH OR UPCAUSE THE WATER IS MAKING A GO UP TO HEAT ACTUALLY M YEA SO YEAH BASE CLY
1326,THE TEMPERATURE'S HOT SO IT'S GOING UP UP UP UP UP BUT IF YOU MAKE IT GO DOWN THEN THE TEMPERATURE WOULD GOING DOWN DOWN DOWN AND IT WOULD BE HAVE TO BE COLD,THE TEMPETURE S HATS WAS GOING U P PAPU BUT IF YOU MAKE IT GO DOWN THEN THE TEMPTOR WA GOING DOWN DOWN DOWN AND IT WOULD BE HAV TO BE COLD
1327,I DID AN EXPERIMENT IN CLASS AND I KNOW WHAT HAPPENS,I DIDN EXPERIMENTIT CLAS AND I KNOW WHAT HAPPENES
1328,I'VE BEEN DOING WATER UH,I HAD BEEN DEING WATER
1329,HI,O
1330,UM I THINK IT FEELS UM COLD,I THINK YIT FEELS UHM COARD
1331,UM TEMPERATURE IS ALL THE HOT AND COLD,TEMPEATURE IS ALL ABOUT HOT NC
1332,D DO YOU HAVE ANYTHING ELSE,DO YOU HAVE ANY THING ELSE
1333,WHEN YOU MAKE IT COLDER IT GOES SOUTH WAY DOWN BUT WHEN YOU MAKE IT HOTTER IT GOES UP OR NORTH,EN YOU MAKE IT COLDER IT GOS SOUTH OR DOWN BUT WHEN YOU MAKE A HATER IT GOS UP R NORTH
1334,THANK YOU AND MARNIE CAN YOU SAY KITTY CATS,THANK YOU AND MORNEY CAN YOU SAY KITTY CAT
1335,CHILL HE,CHEL H
1336,MORE SPACE MARNIE,ORE SPACE MORNING
1337,I NO WHEN UM YOU'RE MAYBE DOING A SCIENCE EXPERIMENT OR AGAIN SEEING WHEN THE TEMPERATURE IS OUTSIDE,IT N WHEN UM YOUR MTENESINCE EXPERIMENT OR AGAIN SEEN WHEN THE TEMPERATURE IS OUTSIDE
1338,UM SOMETHING JUST CAME UP OH OKAY,M SEVEN JUST CAMO THAT LOOK  THE DOORS
1339,YES I HAVE,YES I HAVE
1340,TEMPERATURE IS UM YEAH IT'S HOT AND COLD AND WHEN UM IT IS HOT IT CAN MAKE THE WATER GO UP BUT WHEN IT'S COLD IT GOES DOWN,ZEA
1341,YEAH AND YEAH YEAH BUT CAUSE IT WOULD BE UM HURTFUL IF,YEH IT A YE YEH BUT PRITLMES AREN'T MARGREE ND MOR COULD OO BE UHM HARTFUL IF
1342,THANK YOU,THANK YOU
1343,IT GOES DOWN OR UM IT TAKES UP S A LOT OF SPACE,IT GOES DOW OR UHM TAKES UP SWES SPACE
1344,WE PUT A THERMOMETER IN IT AND THEN IT TELLS YOU TEMPERATURE IF YOU WANT TO BE ROOM TEMPERATURE YOU LET IT STAY IN THE ROOM FOR A WHILE MAYBE A DAY,WIL OU PU FROM MONETER AND IT AND THEN IT TELLS YOU  TEMPERTURE IF YOU WANT TO BE ROMTEMEATURE YOU WOULD STAY IN THE ROOM FOR A WHILE MAYBE A DAY
1345,THE TEMPERATURE BELOW IT IS HOT,TO TEMPATURE BELOW IT IS HAT
1346,IT'S ABOUT IF IT'S I THINK IT'S NOT TOO HOT NOT TOO COLD AND THAT WOULD BE ROOM TEMPERATURE WH AND IT'S RIGHT THERE IN THE MIDDLE TOO HOT WOULD BE TOO UP TOO COLD WOULD BE TOO DOWN YEAH,IT'S ABOUT IF IT'S I THINK IT'S NHAT TO HATEN IT TOO COLD ANDTHAT WOULD BE A ROOMTAMPTCHEREW AND IT'S RIGHT THERE IN THA MIDDLE TOO HAT WOULD BE TO UP TOO COLD OL BEAT YOO DOWNYE
1347,UM THANK YOU MARNIE CAN YOU SAY KITTY CATS,UHM THANK YOU MANEY CAN YOU SIOAT
1348,NO CAUSE I ALREADY KNEW ABOUT THE THERMOMETER SO I JUST THOUGHT THE THING WOULD BE THE SAME,NOCAUSE I AREADLY KNEWT AT BUT THE PRMONETUR SO I JUST LIKE THE FING WOULD BE THA SAN
1349,YOU ARE ABSOLUTELY POSITIVELY RIGHT,YOU ARE ABSULUTLY POUSITIVE LY RIGHT
1350,UM IT GOES DOWN LIKE YOU JUST SHOWED ME OR LOW LOW LOW LOW YES THAT WAS REALLY COOL,M IT GOS DOWN LIKE YOU JUST SHOW ME ORLO WELL H YES THARE IS THREE GOL
1351,ME I THOUGHT IT WAS REALLY COOL,MEAN AI FIGHT WAS RC
1352,INSIDE THE TUBE IS REALLY WATER WITH GREEN FOOD COLORING BUT THEN IT GOES UP WITH HOT WATER DOWN WITH COLD YES,INSDED TO BSR WATER WITH GREEN FOOD COVRING BUT THEN IT GOS UP WITH HAT WATER DOWN WITH COLD YES
1353,YES,YES
1354,UM WHEN YOU WANNA KNOW WHAT TEMPERATURE WILL BE OUTSIDE SO YOU CAN KNOW HOW TO DRESS,WHEN YOU WANT KNOW WHAT TEMPURE WIL BE OUTSIDE SO YOU CAN KNOW HOW TO DRESS
1355,THANK YOU,DANK YOU
1356,THAT TOO,THAT TOO
1357,MARNIE THIS IS JACKIE CAN YOU SAY SOMETHING PLEASE,MORNEY THIS IS JACKEY CAN YOU SAY SAFY PUIECE
1358,WELL SOIL ABSORBS WATER GRAVEL LETS IT GO THROUGH BUT SOMETIMES UM GRAVEL UM GETS WET BY WATER THAT'S MOST OF THE TIME WHAT HAPPENS,WELL STORE YOU ABSORBES WATER GRAVL LETS IT GO THROUGH BUT SOMETIMES UHM GRAVEL UHM GETS WET BUT THEOLER AS MOST OF TIME WHAT HAPPENS
1359,IT HAS IT KEPT SOME INSIDE IT AND IT LET SOME OUT SO THAT WOULD BASICALLY DOUBLE THE MASS THE NORMAL MASS,IT HAD IT KEPT SOME INSIDE IT AND IT WET SOME OUNC SO THAT WOULD BE IQUY DUBBLE THE MAS THE NORMAL MAS
1360,THE WATER TO THE SOIL THE SOIL ABSORBED THE WATER,HE WATER TO D SWARE IT THE SUOL ABSERVED THE WATER
1361,IT'S ABOUT UM HOW THE SOIL CAN ABSORB BUT A LOT BUT THE UM GRAVEL CAN ABSORB VERY LITTLE,S ABOUT UHM HOWA SOYER CAN OBSERVE BUT A WOT BUT THE UHM GRAVLE CAN ABSORB VERY LITTLE
1362,COMES FROM US EXPERIMENTING IN THE CLASS,COME FROM US EXPROMENTANG IN THE CLAS
1363,I SEE TWO TRIANGULAR THINGS THEY'RE KIND OF LIKE UM CONES ONE IS SOIL AND ONE IS GRAVEL,I SEE TWO TRN FANG THAT CAN WIE U CONS ONE SOIL AND ONE S GRAVL
1364,WE'VE BEEN UM WE'VE BEEN DOING STUFF WITH GRAVEL AND SOIL,V WE'VE BEEN DOING STUFF WITH GRAVL AND SOIL
1365,GOOD THANK YOU,GOOD THANK YOU
1366,THANK YOU,ANKUM
1367,ORIGINALLY I THINK THEY CAME FROM UM WELL SOIL CAME FROM DIRT WHICH GOD INVENTED AND UM SAME THING WITH GRAVEL EXCEPT GRAVEL DID NOT COME FROM DIRT,GENALY I IKE TEY CAME FROM UHM THE SOIL CAME FROM DIRT WHICH GOD AND PENTED AND UHM SANING OF GRABOKS AF GRABL DID NOT COME FROM DIRT
1368,WELL UM SOIL CAN HOLD MORE WATER CAUSE IT ABSORBS IT BUT GRAVEL CAN HOLD LESS WATER BECAUSE IT DOES NOT ABSORB IT,OH UHM SORYOR CAN HOLD MORE WATER CAUSE IT ABSORBS IT BUT GRAVL CAN HOLD LES WATER BECAUSE IT DES NOT ABSORB IT
1369,I WATERED THE GRAVEL THE WATER JUST WENT THROUGH,I HAD WANTED TO GRAVEL THE WH I JUST WENT TROUGH
1370,WELL SOMETIMES THE EARTH MATERIAL ABSORBS SOMETIMES THE WATER CAN GO THROUGH,A SOMETIMES THAT ORHMANTI ABSORBE SOMETIMES O THE WATER CAN GO THRUGH
1371,WELL UM IT IS SHORTER THAN THE GRAVEL BECAUSE THE SOIL ABSORBS THE GRAVEL DOES NOT CAUSE THE GRAVEL IS SOLID THE SOIL IS VERY VERY SOFT,WELL UHM IT IS SHORTER DINT GRAVEL BECAUSE THE SOIL AOBSORBS THE GRAVLE AS THAT BECAUSE THE GRAVEL IS SOLID THE SOIL IS VERLY VERY SOFT
1372,THAT UM THE UM GRAVEL ABSORBED ACTUALLY TEN MILLILITERS,DA UHM THE UHM GRAWBLE ABSORBED DACTY TEN MILLINTRS
1373,TO UM COMPLETE FURTHER EXPERIMENTS WITH BETTER EXPERIENCE,LORD IT TO UHM COMPLEATE FARTHER EXPERIMENT WITH BETTER EXPERIENCE
1374,WELL MOST OF IT WENT THROUGH AND UM SOME OF IT STAYED ON THE ROCKS TO LIKE MAKE THE ROCKS WET WET AND YEAH THE REST WENT THROUGH,WELL MOST OF IT WENT THROUGH AND UHM SOME OF IT STAYED ON THE ROCKS TO LIKE MAKE THIT WALX RE WET AN HE HAD  WESS WINT THROUGH
1375,THE AMOUNT OF WATER THAT DRAINED THROUGH THE GRAVEL WAS LESS THAN THE IT WAS MORE THAN THE SOIL BECAUSE THE SOIL ABSORBS THE GRAVEL DOES NOT,THE A MOMP O ORDERED IT DRAIN FOD THEGRAVL WAS LES THAN  WAS MORE THAN THE SOIL BECAUSE THE SOYIR ABSORB THE GRAVL DOA'S NOT
1376,WELL THE WATER DRAINAGE OF THE ROCKS REALLY DOESN'T MAKE THEM THAT HEAVY BECAUSE THEY'RE ALREADY HEAVY AND IT DID NOT ABSORB,W THE WATER DRANAGE OF THE ROCKS RHE DOESN'T MAKE THEM THAT HAPPY BECAUSEE AR READY HEAY AND I  NOT ABSORB
1377,YOU PUT IT ON GRAVEL AND IT GOES THROUGH IT GO IT DOESN'T ABSORB ANYTHING,YOU PUT ON GRAVL AIRIT GOES TFO IT CAUSE IT DOESN'T ABSORB ANYTHING
1378,THE HOT WATER IS LESS DENSE THAT IS WHAT IT TELLS ME,THE HOT WATER IS LESS THAN THAT IS WHAT IT TELLS ME
1379,UM I WOULD SAY IT GOES UP OR NORTH AND BECAUSE THE WATER PUSHES IT UP AND THAT SHOWS IT'S LESS DENSE,UHM I WOULD SAY IT GOES UP OR NORTH AND BECAUSE THE WATER PUSHES IT UP AND THAT SHOWS ITS WEST DENH
1380,THEY FLOAT CAUSE THEY HAVE LESS DENSITY THAN THE WATER,THEY FOLCAUSE THEY HAD LENEDENCITY IN THE WATER
1381,WE'VE BEEN DOING WATER AND TODAY WE SAW THINGS FLOAT AND SINK ACTUALLY DIDN'T BUT WE PUT HOT WATER AND COLD WATER AND HOT WATER WENT TO THE TOP COLD WATER WENT TO THE BOTTOM CAUSE THEY PUT FOOD COLORING IN,WEVE BEEN DOING WATER AND TODAY WE SAW FINGKS FLOT AND STHINK AFTER REASI HIM BUT WE PUT H WANT  COLD WATER AND HOWATER WENT TO SAP COL OAR WENT TO THE BOTTOM CAS I PUPPL COVRYING IT
1382,GOOD BYE MARNIE,GOODBYE MARNY
1383,UM IT IS LESS DENSE,UM IT IS WESTTMS
1384,THANK YOU,DNK
1385,UM IT'S ABOUT THE DENSITY OF THE COLD WATER COMPARED TO THE DENSITY OF THE ROOM TEMPERATURE WATER,UHM I'S ABOUT THE DENCITY OF THE COLD WATER COMPARED TO THE DENCITY OF THE RMTEMPEATURE WATER
1386,SOME OF THEM WILL FLOAT SOME OF THEM WOULD NOT THAT'S WHAT WHAT WE WERE TRYING TO DO ACTUALLY WE WERE JUST DOING HOT WATER COLD WATER,SOME OF THEM W FOAT SOME O BUN WOERE NOT THAT'S WHAT W WE WERE TRYING TO DO EVETE WORD JUST TODN'T HAT WATER COLD WATER
1387,UM THAT THEY ARE MORE DENSE THAN THE WATER,M THAT THEY ARE MORE DAMCE THAN THE WATER
1388,UM IT TOLD ME THAT THE COLD THE CORK UM WAS LESS DENSE THAN THE WATER WHICH I DID NOT KNOW,UHM IT TOLD ME THA THE COA THE CORK UHM WAS LESS DENCE THAN THE WATER WHICH I DID NOT KNOW
1389,THE COLD WATER UM THE COLD WATER IS UM IN THERE AND THE COLD WATER IS ACTUALLY MORE DENSE SO IT IS FLOATING TO THE BOTTOM AND CAN GOING ALL AROUND TOO,THE COLD WATER UM THE COLD WATER IS HM AND THERE AND THE COLD WATER S ACTUALLY MORE DENCETIS FLUTING TO THE BUTTOM AND CAN GO IN AL AROUND HO
1390,WELL THEY'RE ALL ABOUT DENSITY AND WHICH ONES ARE LESS DENSE AND MORE DENSE,WOUD A ABOUT DEN CITY AND WHICH WEANTS A RESTINCE IN MORE DENCE
1391,M THAT UM NOT ALL OF A LOT OF THE RED WATER FLOATED TO THE TOP BUT NOT ALL OF IT BE YOU HAVE TO EVEN A VIAL KIND OF FLOATED TO THE TOP WHEN IT WAS DONE,A TAT UHM N ALL OF A WAT OF THE RED WATER FOARDED TO DOP BUT NO ALL THAT BUACTLY EVEN A VILE KIND OFLODED TO THE TOP WHEN IT WAS DUN
1392,UM IT SINKS AND IT SOMETIMES ALSO GOES DOWN AND SPREADS,UHM ITS SINKS AND ITS AND THEMSELVE SUGLES DOWN IN SPREDS
1393,IT MEANS TO HAVE THE THINGS FLOAT INSTEAD OF MEANS UM LIKE THEY WILL SINK CAUSE THEY'RE MORE DENSE THAN THE WATER,THIT MEANS TO HAVE T TING FOAT INSTEAD OF WON'T MEAN UHM BI THEY ILL SINK CAST MORE DENCE THAIN THE WATER
1394,UH UM HOT WATER WAS MORE DENSE I MEAN LESS DENSE THAN THE COLD I MEAN THAN THE ROOM TEMPERATURE WATER,UHM HO WATER WAS MORE DENCE I MEAN LES TENCE THAN THE COLD I MEAN INTA ROOM TEMPRTURE WATER
1395,THEY ARE BOTH LESS DENSE AND THEY ARE BOTH BOTH HAVE THE SAME DENSITY,THEY ARE BOTH LES DENCE AND DERBBOTHAVE THE SAME DENCITY
1396,THAT THEY UM WOULD THAT THEY ARE LIGHTER THAN THAT THEY ARE LIGHTER THAN THE UH LESS DENSE THAN THE WATER,THE DAY UHM W THAT THEY ARE WHITER THEN THAT THEY ARE WHITER THAN THE WEST DENCE THIN WATER
1397,TRUE,DREW
1398,IT IS ABOUT UM HOW COLD WATER IS MORE DENSE THAN ROOM TEMPERATURE WATER YEAH COLD WATER IS MORE DENSE THAN ROOM TEMPERATURE WATER,IT IS ABOUT UHM HOW COLD WATER IS MORE DENCE THAN INHE ROOM TEMPEARTURE WATER YEA COLD WATERS MORE DENCE THAN ROOM TEMPEATURE WATER
1399,UM THEY UM THEY ARE SINKING BECAUSE THEY ARE MORE DENSE THAN THE WATER,UHM THEY UHM THEY ARE SINKING BECAUSE THEY ARE MORE DANTIN THE WATER
1400,THE RED WATER IS FLOATING OUT OF THE VIAL BECAUSE IT IS LESS DENSE THEREFORE IT FLOATS TO THE TOP WHY CAN'T,THE RED WATER IS FLATING OUF THE VIBLE BECAUSE IT IS LES ENCHE THERE FORE T FOST TO THE TOPO I CA
1401,A GOOD THANK YOU,GOOD THANKIP
1402,THEY STAY ON THE BOTTOM OF THE CUP BECAUSE UM THEY UM ARE MORE DENSE THAN THE WATER SO YEAH IT ALL IS UM IT ALL SOMEHOW CONNECTS TO DENSITY,THAY SIT ON THE BOTTOM OF THE CUP BECAUSE UHM DAY UHM A MORE DENCE IN THE WATER SO YEAH IT ALL IS UHM IT ALL SOME HOW CONECTS TO DENCITY
1403,IT'S EXPOSED TO AIR WHICH CO WHICH IS EVAPORATING IT,S EXPOSED TO AIR WHICH  WHICH IS A APRAGING IT
1404,THE HOT AIR,T HLAR
1405,IN THE WIDER CUP CAUSE IT HAS MORE IT HAS A MORE OF A WAY TO EVAPORATE,IN THE WIDER CUPCAUSE IT HAS MORE IT HAS A MOA WAY TO IVAPIRATE
1406,YES,YES
1407,UM HOW BIG OR ROUND THE SURFACE AREA IS,UH HOW BIG OR ROUND A CURFACE AREA IS
1408,WELL UH YEAH THEY ALL LOST HALF AS I THOUGHT,WEL OH THEYRE THEYT ALL LAST HAVE AS I THOUGHT
1409,GO GOOD THANK YOU,GOO GOOD THANK YOU
1410,B IS ONE HUNDRED BUT C BUT A IS SIXTEEN BUT THERE STILL THE SAME AMOUNT OF WATER,WELL UHM YOU CAN ROLL OVER THEM AND YOE'LL CAN SEE THAT Z IS TWO HUNDRED SQUARE SAID  MITORS SEE IS TWENTY FOUR
1411,UM THEY ARE ALL UM YEAH THEY ALL UH THEY ALL HAVE THE SAME AMOUNT OF WATER JUST IN DIFFERENT CASES,UHM THEY'RE ALL UHM YE THEY ALL UHM THEY 'LL HAVE TO SAM A MUNT O WATER  JUST IN DIFERENT CASES
1412,THE WATER ON THE SURFACE IS TOUCHING UM THE SIDE OF THE CONTAINER,THE WATER ON THE SURFOCE IS TOUCHING UHM THE SIDE OF THE CONTAINOR
1413,EACH ONE LOSES HALF,EACH ONE ROOSES HALF
1414,THIS AREA IS THE AREA OF THE WATER,A AREA IS THE AREA OF THE WATER
1415,UM I'VE BEEN UM DOING EVAPORATION AND TODAY WAS THE SECOND DAY OF WHERE WE PUT STUFF IN PLACES LIKE THE REFRIGERATOR THE CEILING THE WINDOW SILL THE CORTEC COMPUTER,UHM I'VE BEEN UHM THIN O APIBATION AND  TODAY WAS A SECOND DAY IWORE WE PUT STU IND PLACES I THE REFRIGURATOR T SEELING THE WINDOW SAILED T OURT T COMPUTER
1416,IT'S ABOUT HOW WIDE THE THING IS IT WAS JUST HALF BECAUSE IT'S SO WIDE AND AVAILABLE TO BE EVAPORATED,IT'S ABOUT HOW WHI THE FANG IS IT WASIS HAF BECAUSE IT SO WIDE AND AVAILIBLE TO BE AVAPIRATED
1417,TWO HUNDRED SQUARE CENTIMETERS,TO ARE DISCORSE AMATOR
1418,WELL THE HOTTER THE ROOM AND THE WIDER THE SURFACE AREA THE MORE IS EVAPORATING,WEL THE HUTTERED A ROOM AND THE WHIDERD A CURFACE AREA THE MORE IS THE VAPARATED
1419,GOOD THANK YOU,GO THANK YOU
1420,T THE PAPER TOWEL GOT WET AND SOON THE WATER WAS GONE BUT YOU COULD SEE THAT IT HAD TAKEN THE WATER INTO ITS MATERIAL,THE PAPER TOWEL GOT WET AND SOON THE WATER WAS GONE BUT YOU COULD SEE THAT IT HAD TAKEN H WATER INTO ITS MATERIAL
1421,UM WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT WATER AND UM DOING LOTS OF FUN EXPERIMENTS AND AND WE'VE PLAYED WITH NORMAL AND SOAPY AND EVEN SALT WATER,UHM WE'VEBEEN WORNING ABOUT WATER AND UHM DOING LATS OF FUN EXPERIMENTS AN AND WE'VE PWIED WITH NORMAL AND SOPY AND EVEN SOALT WATER
1422,JUST A SPOT OF WATER BUT IF UM BUT AS IT I PUT MORE DROPS AND IT LOOKED STARTED TO LOOK LIKE A DOME,JUST THE SPOT OF WATER BUT IT'S UHM BUT AS IT I PUT MORE DROPS WHEN IT LOOK STARTED TO LOOK LIKE A DOME
1423,YES IT WAS REALLY INTERESTING TO DO THAT AND LEARN ALL ABOUT THE AND YOU LEARNED SOME ABOUT WATER THAT I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW,YES IT WAS REALLY INTESTING TO DUDA AND WERE IN ALL ABOUT THE AND WORD SOUNE ABOUT WATER DH IEDN'T EVEN KNOW
1424,YOU HAVE TO TILT THE PAPER AND SOMETIMES IT DOESN'T WORK EVENTUALLY IF YOU TILT IT ENOUGH IT DOES,YOU HAVE TO TILT THE PAPER AND SOMETIMES IT DOESN'T WORK BUT VENTERE IF YOU TI T ENOUGH IT DOES
1425,THANK YOU YOU ARE VERY KIND,DANK YOU YOU HERE VERY KIND
1426,BECAUSE THE ALL THE UM DROPS OF WATER I THINK THEY GO TOGETHER AND JUST THEY MAKE THAT SHAPE AND CAUSE IT'S A CERTAIN MATERIAL IT DOESN'T JUST FALL FLAT,BECAUSE T ALL UHM DROPS OF WATER I THINK THEY GO TOGETVHER AND JUST THAT MAKE THAT SHAPE AND CAUSE IT SHEART I MATERIAL IT DOESN'T JUST FALL FLAT
1427,WATER TENSION IS THE THING THAT MAKES IT SHAPE LIKE ANYTHING IT WANTS TO BE LIKE,WAT ATENTION IS THE FING THAT MAKES IT SHAPE LIKE ANYTHING IT WANTS TO BE LIKE
1428,IT I MEANT BY LIKE WHAT AS WHEN YOU PUT IN MORE DROPS ON THE UM SOAPY WATER IT CAN HOLD LESS THAN A PENNY CAN HOLD WITH NORMAL WATER,IT I MET BI WIKE IT W AS WHEN YOU PUT  MORE DROPS ON TE UHM SOPY WATER IT CAN HOLD FAST THAN TA PENY CAN HOLD WITH NORMAL WATER
1429,IT LOOKS LIKE A TEAR DROP,IT LOOKS LIKE A TEAR DROP
1430,SO THE PUDDLE WAS SO COOL IT WAS JUST LIKE A DOME WHICH I BELIEVE IS THE SCIENTIFIC TERM FOR SOMETHING,SO THE PUDDLE WAS SO COLL IT WAS JUST LIKE A TONE WHICH I BEWEEVE IT'S A SIENTIFIC TURM FOR SOMETING
1431,BYE SHE'S,BY HE'S
1432,GOOD THANK YOU,GOD THANK YOU
1433,IT GOES UP INTO THE AIR,IT GOS UP INTO THE AIR
1434,UM OH WAIT SORRY I,PLEASE RE PEAT I WAIT SORY I
1435,M COLD COLD WATER,I CO COLD WATER
1436,WELL UM IN ONE IT'S COLD WATER WHICH CAUSES SURFACE TENSION TO BREAK AND UH WATER VAPOR TO BE SEEN THEN EVENTUALLY GOES UP TO AIR AND TURNS INTO WHAT IT WAS,WELL UHM IN WHEN IT'S CALED WATER WHICH CAUSE HES SURVUS ATENTION TO BREAK IN A WATER APUR TO BE SEEN DENR THEN SHE GOES UP THE ARAND TURNS INTO WHAT IT WAS
1437,WELL WE'VE BEEN DOING CONDENSATION AND EVAPORA AND THEN MOSTLY CONDENSATION BUT A LITTLE BIT OF EVAPORATION,WELLE WE'VE BEEN DOING CONDENSATION AND EVECBOR A AND IN MOST CONVESATION BUT A LITTLE BIT OP EV APIRATION
1438,UM WELL SOME THING'S THAT EVAPORATE ARE WATER AND WATER HOT WATER COLD WATER ANY KIND OF WATER,W UM WELL SOME THINGS OUT OF THATBARAT OUR WATER AND WATER HOT WATER CLAED WATER ANY KIND OF WATER
1439,ALL ABOUT THE WIND CARRYING THE WATER IN THE AIR TO DIFFERENT PLACES,AL ABOUT THE WIND CARYING THE WATER IN THEAR TO DIFERNT PLACES
1440,LIKE A BIG LAKE OR YEAH BIG LAKE AND WET,BRIKE A BIG LKE OR YOU HA BIG LAKE AND WET
1441,K PEOPLE MAKE CONDENSATION CHAMBERS TO SEE IF CONDENSATION HAPPENS IN THE CHAMBER,PEOPLE MAKE CONDENSATION CHAMBERS TO SEEVE CONVESATION HAPENDS IN THE CHAMBER
1442,UM WATER EVAPORATES AND HOT WATER AND COLD WATER EVAPORATES TOO WELL THAT'S STILL WATER BUT YEAH,UHM WATER VAPRATES AND HUT WATER AND COLD WATER IVAPIRATES TOO  A STI WATER BUT YEA
1443,T TRUE,TRUE
1444,AIR,AIR
1445,TRUE,TRE
1446,WATER DROPLETS FORM AT WHATEVER PART HAS SPACE THEY GET SEPARATED INTO LITTLE LITTLE LITTLE ONES MAKE REALLY BIG A REALLY BIG ONE,WATER DROP ITS FORMHAT WHATEVER PART HASE SPACE THEY AN SEBER IN TO WITOLE WITOWE WITLE ONES MAKE REALLY BIT A REAY BIG ONE
1447,GOOD,GOOD
1448,UM IT'S KIND OF LIKE THE VAPOR VERSION OF WATER,HM IS KNDA LIKE THE VIEPEVERSION OF WATER
1449,ELEVEN TWENTY FOUR SEE ONE ONE TWO FOUR CONNECTION LOST PRESS OKAY AND WAIT FOR MARNIE OKAY,WULT I HINK OT ALL ABOUT HOW A WATE OF APER SNEAKED IN AND NOW YOU CAN SEE WOTE VAPER WIT A BUBBLES F AIR WHAT WOOK LIKE AIR ANYWAY
1450,TRUE,TRE
1451,WELL CONDENSATION,BO CONDANSATION
1452,UM IT'S LIKE LITTLE CIRCLES BUT WHEN IT GOES ON THE HOT SURFACE YOU CAN ACTUALLY SEE IT AND WHEN YOU TOUCH IT IT BECOMES LITTLE DROPLETS LIKE LITTLE RAIN DROPS TEARS THAT KIND OF THING,UHM IT'S LIKE WIDOW CIRCLES BUT WHEN IT GOES NT HASIVOUS YOU CAN NACTUL SEE IT AND WHEN YOU TAUTCH IT IT BECOMES SWIDOW DROP LITS LIKE WILDOW RAIN DROPS TEARS THAT KIND OF FANG
1453,UM IT WAS ABOUT SEEING IF CONDENSATION HAPPENED IN THE CHAMBER,HM IT WAS ABOUT SEINE OF CONVERSCATIONRE AND HAPPENED IN THET CHAMBERI TA
1454,HELLO MY UM,HEWELL MY UM
1455,YEAH WELL IT'S NOT THAT LOUD,YE WELL IS NOT THAT LOUD
1456,MMM THEY ATTRACT TO ANY PIECE WITH WELL IT DEPENDS WITH ANY PIECE WITH IRON IF THEY HAVE IRON IN IT BECAUSE THERE'S A MINUS AND A PLUS SIDE,THE TRACK TO ANY PIECE WITH WELL DPANS WITH ANY PIECE WITH IAN IF THEY HAVE IRNINT BECAUSE THERE'S A MINAS AND A PLU SIDE
1457,YEAH AND IT'S A LOT OF COM IT'S PRETTY COMPLICATED,YE AN LOT F IT'S PRETTY COMPLICATED
1458,THE IT IT DOESN'T WORK DOESN'T IT IT JUST DOESN'T DO ANYTHING IT JUST STAYS WHERE IT IS,THE IT IT DOESN'T WORK DOESN'T IT IT JUST DOESN'T DO ANYTHINK JUSTTAYS WHE IT IS
1459,THE SWITCH I JUST HAVE TO HIT IT,THE SWISH I JUST HAVE TE HAD
1460,CAUSE WE DON'T HAVE STRONG ENOUGH BATTERIES WE JUST USE D CELL BATTERIES,CAUSE WE DON'T HAVE STRONG ENOUGH BADEREES WE JUST USE T SELL BATERYES
1461,JUST THAT THE POWER WAS STRONGER AND,JUST THAT THE POWERE WAS STRONGER AND
1462,THEY JUST PUSH IT FORWARD BUT THERE'S LIKE THIS MAGNETIC FIELD IN IT THAT'S BLOCKING IT AND JUST PUSHING IT OUT BUT THEN WHEN YOU CLAMP IT JUST AND THEN YOU LET GO IT JUST FLIES OUT,THE JUST PUSH IT FORD BUT THER'S LIKE THIS MAGNEC FIEL INT THAT' BLOCKING IT JUST PUSHING IT OUT BUT THEN W AN CLAMP IND JUST AND THEN O LET GO JUST FLIES OUT
1463,A THE REPELLING,A THE REPELLING
1464,Y Y IF ONE OF IT HAS IRON IN IT YES,IF ONE O IT HAS IORN IN IT YES
1465,THEN THE ELECTRICITY IS BROKEN A CIRCUIT,THER THE LECTRISITY IS BROKEN CIRCUT
1466,MMM YEAH,YEA
1467,UM THE BATTERY WAS JUST GIVING THE ELECTRICITY AND POWER FOR IT TO FLOW THROUGH AND THEN YEAH DO IT MAKE A CIRCUIT AND THEN MAKE ALSO A MAGNET AT THE SAME TIME,UHM THE BATORY WAS JUS GIVING THE LECTRISITING POUER FOR IT TO FLOW THROUGH AND THEN EA DO IT MAKE A SCIRKET AND THEN IT MAKE ALSOR AF MAGNET AT THE SAME TIME
1468,UM IF YOU TURNED IT WELL THE SWITCH CAN ACTUALLY TELEGRAPH THE THING YOU HAVE TO TAKE THE UM SWITCH AND HIT IT AGAINST THE METAL PART,UHM IF YOU TURNE IT U WELL TH SWITCH TUT ACTUALLY TELLIGRAF THE THING YET TO TAKE IT UHM SWISCH AND HATED AGAINST THE META PART
1469,MAGNETIC F MAGNETIC FORCE UH I IT UM IF THE NOTHER MAGNET THEN YOU CAN ATTACH LIKE NOT JUST BE ATTRACTED AND,MAGNETT MAGNETI FORCE OH IT UHM IF THER'SNOTHER MAGNET THEN YOU CAN ATTACH LIKE NOTRUSE BE ATTRACTED AND
1470,UH JUST LIKE ONE CENTIMETER AWAY FROM YOU,JUST LIKE ONE SENT A METO WAV MU
1471,IT WOULD LIKE FROM FAR AWAY LIKE IF YOU PUT THE METAL BAR FAR AWAY THEN IT WILL CON STILL DO IT AND THEN YOU CAN SHOW HOW HOW STRONG IT IS,IT LIKE FROM FAR AWAYVE LIKE IF YOU PUT THE METL BAR FAR AWAY THEN IT CAN STILL DO IT AND THEN YOU CAN SHOW HOW HOW STRONG IT IS
1472,IT'S A PATHWAY FOR ELECTRICITY,IT'S A PATHWAY FOR LECTRICITY
1473,A,
1474,SO SO WHEN YOU KEPT HITTING THE THING WITH THE BAR THAT ON THE SWITCH THEN THE THERE'S THIS BAR HERE THAT WAS HITTING ON THE RIVET,SO SO WHEN YOU KEPT DITTING THE THING WITH THE BAR THAT ON THE SWITCH THEN THE THEREWAS THE SPAR HERE THAT WAS HITING ON THE RIVER
1475,YEAH,YE
1476,THEN IT HITS IT BUT THEN IT STICKS SO THAT'S WHY YOU HAVE TO HIT IT BACK AND FORTH REALLY QUICK,THEN IT HITS IT BUT THEN IT STICKS SO THAT'S WHY'HAVE TO HIT IT BACK IN FORTH RI QUICK
1477,PAPER WELL PAPER CLIPS DO WORK BUT PAPER CLIPS AND PAPER CLIPS DON'T STICK TOGETHER,PAPER WELL PAPER CLIPS DOO WORK BUT PAPER CLIPS IN PAPER CLIPS DON'T STICK TOGETHER
1478,THEY'RE INSIDE THE WIRES THE ELECTRICITY IS FLOWING,THERE INSIRED THE WIRES THELTRISCITY IS FLOWING
1479,ME MAYBE POSSIBLY YEAH,M MAYBE POSIBLLY YE
1480,NO,NO
1481,TH THEY WOULD JUST BEING USED,THEY WERE JUST BEING USED
1482,IT MAKES THE BAR HIT AGAINST THE RIVET,IT MAKES THE BARK HIT AGAINST THE RIVET
1483,YEAH,EAH
1484,YEAH IT'S A MAGNET BUT THE MAGNET WAS USED TO ALSO MAKE UM THE TALKING CLICKS,YEH IT'S A MAGNET BUT THE MAGNET WAS USED TO ALSMAKE UHM THEI TALKING CLICKS
1485,NORTH AND NORTH WON'T ATTRACT SOUTH AND SOUTH WON'T ATTRACT I THINK,NORTHTHAN NORTH WON ATRACT SAT IN SOUTHONE TRAP I THANK
1486,THE ELECTRICITY DID SOMETHING TO IT,THE  LETTRISCITY DID SOMETHING TO
1487,YEAH YEAH,VA
1488,WELL WITH OTHER EXPERIENCE WE DID IT,WHAT WATH OTHER EXPERIENCE WE DID IT
1489,YEAH THE ELECTRICITY WAS F FING JUMPING,THE LECTISCITY WAS  ETHING JUMPING
1490,UM SOUTH AND NORTH WOULD ATTRACT,UHM SOUTH THAN NORTH WARED ATRACKT
1491,YEP,
1492,DO,TWO
1493,YEP,YE
1494,YOU COULDN'T IT JUST SCREW IT JUST JUST RICOCHETS OFF IT IT DOESN'T STAY,YOU COULDN'TI JUST GO JUST JUST LICKER SHAES OF IT DOESN'T STAY
1495,IN FIVE WIRES,IN FIVE WIRES
1496,YEAH,YEAR
1497,YEAH BUT IT ALSO WORKED AS A TELEGRAPH THING,YA BUT IT ALSO WORKED AS THE TIGRAF THING
1498,UH NOPE,NO
1499,YEAH SO IT JUST CUTTING THE CIRCUIT,EAH SO I JUST CUTTING THE CIRCUT
1500,THE NEGATIVE AND THE A UWE WELL WE SHOULD JUST SAY NORTH AND SOUTH,THE NEIGITIVE AND THE AND  WHAT WE SHOULD JUST SAY NORTHAND SOUTH
1501,YEAH,YEAR
1502,I JUST FELT IT AS I DON'T KNOW JUST MORE ELECTRICITY AND,I JUST FELT IT AS ON' KNOW JUST MORE LECTRICITY AND
1503,THE BAR THAT HITS THE RIVET,THE BAR THAT HITHS THE RIVER
1504,NOPE,NOTE
1505,S BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT WORKS THE BEST,S BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT WORKS THE BEST
1506,YEAH,YEAH
1507,O TH WELL THE DREDGE BAR OR THE BAR THAT HITS THE RIVET,HW THE BRIDGE BAR ORF THE BAR THAT HITS THE RIVER
1508,METAL,MIDDLE
1509,UM YOU CAN S S FLIP THE RIB RIVET AROUND AND THEN SEE IF IT WORKS,UHM YOU CAN S S FLIP THE RIB RIBIT AROUND AND THEN SEE IF IT WORKS
1510,MAYBE I DON'T REALLY KNOW,MAYBE I DON'T REL I KNOW
1511,UH WE HAD A GROUP AND THE WE TALKED WITHIN EACH OTHER,H WE HAD A GROUP AND THEN WE TALKED WITH IN EACH OTHER
1512,NO WE ALL USED THE SAME THING,NO WE ALL USE THE SAME THING
1513,YOU CAN DO A MANUAL ONE WHICH YOU JUST TAKE TH THE BUTTON AND THEN JUST FLICK IT AND JUST CA E CA DO THE CLICKING THING,YOU CAN DO A MANOWIL UN WHICH YOU JUST TAKE TH THE BARN THAND JUST FLICK IT AND DUS  N C D HE CLICKING THING
1514,IT WOULD BE A LOT MORE POWERFUL,IT'LL BE A LOT MORE POWRFUL
1515,THE ELECTROMAG YEAH,THEL COM YEA
1516,THE BAR IRON SOME SORT OF METAL THAT MAGNETS LIKE AND THAT STUFF THAT ATTRACT LIKE,THE BAR IO SOME SORT OF MEDDL DAC MAGNETS LIKE AND THAT STUFFED THAT A TRACK LI
1517,THE BUT WHAT THE PROBLEM IS IS THAT WE ONLY HAD JUST THREE WIRES SO WE CAN'T USE THREE WIRES TO A TO ATTACH TWO BATTERIES TO THE SWITCH,BUT WAT THE PROBLEM IS IS THAT WE ONLY HAD JUST THREE WHILES SO WE CAN'T USE THREE WIVE TO TO ATTATCH TO BADERES TO THE SWITCH
1518,THE PLUS SIDE IS THE POSITIVE AND THE MINUS SIDE IS THE NEGATIVE SIDE,THE PU SIDE IS THE POUSITIVE VENA MINA SIDE IS THE NIGETIVE SNE
1519,MMM YES BECAUSE IF THE POSITIVE SIDE DOES NOT TOUCH THE BOTTOM AND THE NEGATIVE SIDE DOESN'T TOUCH THE SIDE IT IT WON'T TURN ON,YES BECAUSE IF THE POSETIF SIDE DOES NOT TRTCH THE BOTTOM AND THE NEGET FSIDE DOESN'T TUTCH THE SIDE I IT WON'T TURN ON
1520,OKAY,OK
1521,AFTER THAT THE THE LIGHT BULB LIGHTS UP,AFTER THAT THE THE RIHT PAB LIHTES UP
1522,THE ELECTRICITY MOVES THROUGH THE WIRE AND INTO THE LIGHT BULB,THE LCTRISCITY MOVES THROUGH THE WIRE AND INTO THE LAPUM
1523,YES,YES
1524,YES THEY'RE IMPORTANT,YES THER IMPORTANT
1525,I THINK IT'S ABOUT THE JUST BOTH SIDES HAVE TO TOUCH THE LIGHT BULB SOME,I SEK IT'S ABOUT THE JUST BOTH SIDES HAVE TO TUTCH THE LIFEBOB SOMEWAY
1526,YOU CAN USE TWO WIRES AND CONNECT EACH WIRE TO ONE OF THE SIDES TO THE NEGATIVE AND POSITIVE AND CONNECT BOTH WIRES TO THE LIGHT BULB,YOU CAN USE TWO WIRES AND CONECT EACH WRE TO ON IN THE SIDE TO THE NEGIT IMPOSITIVE AND CUL NACK BOTH WIRES TO THE LF BUMB
1527,THE WIRES AND THE BATTERY DIDN'T LIGHT THE LIGHT BULB BECAUSE BECAUSE THEY WEREN'T IN THE RIGHT PLACES,THE WIRES AND THE BETTER DIDN'T LEKE THE LIGHT BOU BECAUSE BECAUSE THEY WERE IN THE RIGHT PLACES
1528,YES IT DIDN'T LIGHT THE LIGHT BULB,YES IT DIDN'TLIGHTE THE LIGHAL
1529,THEY'RE IMPORTANT BECAUSE WITHOUT THE NEGATIVE OR POSITIVE SIDE THE LIGHT BULB CAN'T LIGHT LIGHT UP,THEIRE IMPORTENT BECAUSE WITHOUT THE NIGETIVE ORE POUSITIVE SIDE THE LIF POB CANT LI LIGHTE UP
1530,THE TWO LINE IS THE D CELL AND THE SWIRLY THINGS ARE THE LIGHT BULBS,THE TO LINE IS THE DEECAILE AND THE SALIY THINGS AR THE LEPOBS
1531,NO,NO
1532,GOOD,G
1533,HERE IS SHOWING WHERE WHERE EACH OF THE WHERE THE ELECTRICITY IS FLOWING THROUGH,HERE SHOWING WHERE WHERE EACH OF THE WHERE THE LECTRISITY IS FLYING THRO
1534,THE GREEN LIGHT MIGHT CONNECT TO IT BY UM EACH BY IT SHOWS WHICH CIRCUIT IS WHICH,DOT CREL MY CONECTT B WEICH BY SHOS WHICH CIRKE IS WHICH
1535,BY TOUCHING I MEAN THE WIRES ARE ALWAYS CONNECTING TO EACH OTHER,I TUCHING I MEAN THAT THE WIRS ARE ALWAYS CONECTING TO EACH OTE
1536,I SEE TWO PATHWAYS,I SEE TOO PATHWAYS
1537,THE OTHER PICTURE THE PATHWAYS THERE WAS TWO PATHWAYS AND IN THIS ONE THERE IS TWO OTHER PATHWAYS,THE OTHER PICTURE UNTHER PATH WAYS THERE WAS TWO PATHWAYS AND IN THIS ONE THERES TWO OTHER PATH WAY
1538,MMM SOME TYPE OF CIRCUITS CIRCUITS ONLY HAVE ONE WAY FOR THE ELECTRICITY TO FLOW THROUGH AND SOME OF THE ONES HAVE TWO WAYS OR MORE,SOME TP OF CIRC CIRCKUETS ONLY HAVE ONE WAY FOR THE LICER SHOULD NEED TO FLOAT THROUGH AND SOME OTHER ONES HAVE TWO WAYS OR MORE
1539,IN THE OTHER PICTURE THE ENERGY OF THE BATTERY WAS GOING TO TWO DIFFERENT TO TWO DIFFERENT LIGHT BULBS,ENDURED THE PICTURE THE ENR DO THE BETTER WAS GOING TO TO DIFFERET TO TWO DIFFERE NT BOMBS
1540,YES WE DID,YES WE DO
1541,AND THE FLOW ALWAYS UM ALWAYS GOES RIGHT BACK TO THE BATTERY,THE FLO ALWAYS M ALWAYS GOS RIGHT BACK TO BATTER
1542,NO,NO
1543,THE PARALLEL CIRCUITS UM HA HAVE ALWAYS HAVE MORE THAN TWO WAYS FOR FOR THE EL,PALO CIRKET UM HA ALWAYS HAVE MORE THAN TWO WACH FOR FOR THE
1544,IN PARALLEL CIRCUITS THE PATHWAYS THERE IS ALWAYS TWO OR MORE,AND PLOW TRIKT THE PATHWAVS THERE I'S A WA TWO OR MORE
1545,THE DIRECTION OF THE FLOW ALWAYS GOES TO ONE LIGHT BULB AND THEN TO ANOTHER,THE DIRECTION OF THE FLOT ALWAY GOES TO WONE LIKE BOB AND THEN TO ANOTHER
1546,MMM I DON'T KNOW,I DON'T KNOW
1547,WE HAVE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT DIFFERENT KIND TYPES OF CIRCUIT,WE HAVE BEEN LEARNING ABOT DIFERENT K TYPES OF CIRCUTE
1548,A CIRCUIT IS UM A OPEN CIRCUIT IS IF IT HAS A HOLE,THE CIRKE IS T A OPEN CIRAT IS IF IT HAS A
1549,GOOD I GUESS,GOOD I GUESSE
1550,IF IT'S AN OPEN CIRCUIT THEN IT WON'T THE BATTERY WON'T GIVE ENERGY TO THE TO THE MOTOR,IT'S AN OPEN CIRKEY AN AD WON'T THE BEATTER YOU WON'T GIVE ENARGY TO THE TO THE MODER
1551,THE RECEIVER'S WHAT TAKES THE ENERGY AND THE WIRE'S ARE WHAT TAKES THE ENERGY TO IT AND THE BATTERY IS WHAT GIVES THE WIRES THE ENERGY TO TAKE TO THE RECEIVER,THE RECEIVER IS WE TAKES THE ENARGY AND THE WIRS HEART WHAT TAKES THE ENARGY TO IT AND THE BETTER IS W GIVES THE WIRES THE ENARGY TO TAKE TO THE RECEIVER
1552,CIRCUIT ARE LIKE ARE LIKE I THINK PAPER CLIPS AND AND OTHER KINDS OF METAL,THEM PUNT OF A SRKIT AR LAR I THINK PAPER CLIPS AND AND OTHER KIND OF METAL
1553,I DISCOVERED THAT ONLY METAL ANY KIND OF METAL COULD COULD COULD MAKE THE MOTOR WORK,I DISCOVERED THAT ONLY METLE ANY KIND OF MDL CO COU COULD MAKE THE MOTER MORK
1554,THE THE METAL CAN PICK UP THE WASHERS,THE THE MIDDALE CAN PICK UP THE WASHES
1555,CAUSE MMM WASHERS ER I DON'T REALLY KNOW,MOSERSI DON'T READ TO KNOW

2454,THE ENERGY IS FLOWING THROUGH A CERTAIN PATHWAY,THE ENARGY IS FLOWING THROUGH A CEIRTIN PATHWAY
2455,IT STILL LIGHTS UP BUT THE OTHER ONE GETS BRIGHTER,IT STILL LIGHT SOW THAT THE OTHER ONE GETS BRIGTER
2456,ENERGY,ENARGY
2457,LONG STRING OF LIGHT IS LIKE,E LONG STRING OF LIGHT IS LE
2458,YOU MUST NOT INTERRUPT ME TODAY,YOU MUST NOT INTERRUPT ME TODAY
2459,IT JUST SHUTS OFF,IT JUST SCUTS OF
2460,FROM BULBS OUT,FLIM BULLS OUT
2461,ONE'S BURNED OUT AND ONE'S STILL PERFECTLY GOOD IT IT'S JUST SHUT OFF PLUS THE ENERGY ISN'T FLOWING THROUGH,ONE PURNTS OUT AND ONE STILL PERFECTLY GOOD EXIT'S JUST SHUT OF PLUS TE ENARGYS AN FLNG THROUGH
2462,IT'S ENERGY WELL IF CLICK ON,IT'S ENARGYN WLL IF YOU CLICK O
2463,IF ONE GETS OFF THE OTHER ONE GETS BRIGHTER,IT WOULDN'T GET'S OF THE OTHER ONE GETS SPRITER
2464,IT,I
2465,PARALLEL CIRCUIT,WILL CIRC
2466,THE ENERGY FLOWS JUST ONE WAY,ANORTY FLOWS JUST ONE WAY
2467,RING,N
2468,IF A WHITE BULB GE RUNS OUT THAT MEANS THE OTHER ONE'S GETTING BRIGHTER,IF THE LIGHT WALL G RUNS OUT THAT MEANS THE OTHER ONE'S GETTING BRITER
2469,IF ONE BULB BURNS OUT IT THE FILAMENT IS BROKEN,IF WEN BL BIRDS OUT IT THE FILLMT IS BROKEN
2470,THE OTHER ONE STILL LIGHTS UP BUT GETS WAY BRIGHTER,THE OTHER ONE STILL LIGHTS UP BUT GETS WAY BRIHTER
2471,IF,IF
2472,UM THE OTHER,DA
2473,THE FILAMENT POWERS THE BULB SO IF IT BURNS OUT THE FILAMENT WILL BREAK,THE VILLEMT POWERS THE BALL OF SO IF IT BURNS OUT TO FILLIM IT OR BREAK
2474,UM IT STILL BURNS OUT,IT STILL BURNS OUTW
2475,THE OTHER LIGHT BULB GETS BRIGHTER,THE OTHER LIGHT BOB GETS SPRIDER
2476,TWO,CH
2477,I'VE BEEN STUDYING MORE ABOUT MAGNETS,IVV BEEN STUDING MORE ABOUT MAGNETS
2478,I'M GOING TO NEED HELP TALKING,IT WAS BACICLY JUST LIKE
2479,GOOD,GOOD H
2480,IS VERY GOOD UH COULD YOU BE A LITTLE MORE PACIFIC,IS VERY GOOU DO YOU BE LITTLE MORE PECIFIC
2481,BYE BYE BYE BA BA BYE BYE BYE,BYE BY BAB  A BY BY BY BYE
2482,AND WELL I NEED HELP HI,BECAUSE IT'S BACAY JUST DOING SOMETHING DIFFERENT LIKE IF I CLICK ON THIS IT WILL DO SOMETHING LIKE IFI GET ON THE MAT
2483,IF YOU HAVE A MAGNET RIGHT HERE ON THIS PIECE ON THE BIG PIECE OF PAPER AND A MAGNET RIGHT HERE ON THE THIN PIECE OF PAPER AND A PENCIL RIGHT HERE IT WON'T BE STRONG ENOUGH TO PULL TOWARDS THIS WITH A PENCIL BEHIND IT,IIF YOU HAVE A MAGNET RIGHT HERE ON THIS PIECE ON THE BIG PIECE OF PAPER AND A MAGNET RIGHT HERE ON THE THEN PIECE OF PAPER AND A PENCIL RIGHT HERE IT WILN'T BE STRONG ENOUGH TO PULL TOWARDS THIS WITH A PENCIL BEHIND IT
2484,THE FORCE OKAY,THE FORCE OKA
2485,WELL THE NAIL HAS A MAGNETA FIELD AROUND IT SO IF YOU PUT THE MAGNET ON IT AND PUSH IT DOWN IT'S LIKE THE MAGNET WILL STICK TO THE PAPER CLIP ALWAYS,WILL THE NAIL HAS A MAGNATA FELED AROUND IT SO IF YOU PUT THE MAGET ON IT AND PUSH IT DOWN IT'S LIKE THE MAGNET WILL STICK TO THE PAPER CLIP ALWAYS
2486,IT'S BASICALLY JUST IT'S BASICALLY THE PAPER CLIP IS ALWAYS GONNA BE MAGNETIZED RATHER WHAT YOU DO IT'S GOING TO BE MAGNETIZED BUT IF YOU HAVE SOMETHING TOO THICK THE MAGNET WON'T STICK TO THE PAPER CLIP,IT'S BACEIC JUST IT'S BACEICAY THE PAPER CLIP IS ALWAYS GOIGNG T BE MAGNETIZED RATHER WHAT YOU DO IT'S GOOD TO BE MAGNITIZE BUT IF YOU HAVE TO SOMETHING TOO THICK THE MAGNET WILS STICK TO THE PAPER CLIP
2487,THE NAIL ISN'T FORCING THE PAPER CLIP UP TO IT BECAUSE THE MAGNET'S OFF IT AND ALSO THE FORCE IS OFF IT SO THE MAGNET STILL HAS A FORCE AND ABSERBED IT LIKE IT UP,THE NAIL IS FOR SEING THE PAPER CLIP UP TO IT BECAUSE THE MAGNETS OFI AND ALSO THE FORSE IS OFF IT SO THE MAGNET TOL HAS HA FORSCT AND OBSERVED  LIGHT SWELL IT UP
2488,WELL MOSTLY I'VE BEEN LIKE JUST TRYING TO DISCOVER WHAT ELSE IS MAGNETS BY RUBBING A MAGNET ON SOMETHING THAT'S NOT MAGNETIZED AND IT WORKED,WELL MOSTLY I FE LIKE JUST TRYING TO DICOVER WHAT ELSEES MAGNETS BY RUBBING A MAGNET ON SOMETHING THAT'S NOT MAGNETIZED AND IT WORKED
2489,BECAUSE OF THE FORCE IS FORCING IT TO STICK TOGETHER,BECAUSE HIN THE FOREST IS FORSEING TO STICK TOGETHER
2490,OKAY SO IT'S THE GRAVITY IT'S CALLED A FORCE AND IF IT DOESN'T STICK THAT'S FORCING IT AWAY FROM IT,OKAY SO IT'S THE GRAVITY IT'S CALLED A FORCE AND IF IT DOESN'T STICK THAT'S FORSING IT AWAY FROM IT
2491,THE NAIL WON'T PICK UP THE PAPER CLIP BECAUSE IT'S NOT MAGNETIZED YET,THE NAIL WI'T PICK UP THE PAPER CLIP BECAUSE DOE'S NOT MAGNETIZED YET
2492,THE NAIL ISN'T PICKING UP THE PAPER CLIP BECAUSE THE FORCE IS ALWAYS IN THE MAGNET,THE NAIL ISN'T PICKING UP THE PAPER CLIP BECAUSE THE FORCE IS ALWAYS IN THE MAGNET
2493,NETISM BASICALLY IS VERY VERY IMPORTANT,TIT IS ONLY BACICY IS VERY VERY IMPORTAANT
2494,CAUSE THE NAIL IS GETTING THE MAGNETIC FORCE FROM THE MAGNET SO FOR INSTANCE IF YOU KEPT DOING IT IT WILL MAKE THE PAPER CLIP STICK,CAUSE THE NAIL IS GATTING THE MAGNET AT FOURST FROM THE MAGNET SO FOR INSTANCE IF YOU KEPT DOING IT IT WILL MAKE THE PAPER CLIP STICK
2495,IT'S CALLED A SHOW FLOW,CALLED AY SHI FLOWT
2496,EVERYTHING WILL DROP BECAUSE MOST OF THE RINGS ARE GETTING STUCK FROM THE MAGNET,EVERYTHING WILL DROP BECAUSE MOST OF THE RINGS ARE GETTING STUCK FROM THE MAGANTE
2497,THE RIVET IS UM SURROUNDED BY ALL THE WIRES THAT ARE TYING IT UP,THE RIVEY IS HM SURROUNDED BY ALL THE WIERS THAT ERE TIDING IT UP
2498,OKAY OKAY CAN WE JUST MOVE ONTO ANOTHER THING,OK OK CAN E JUST MOVE ONTO ANOTHER THING
2499,BECAUSE ALL THE ENERGY FLOWS AROUND AND AROUND AND AROUND AND AROUND THE RIVET AND GOES BACK INTO THE BATTERY AND DOES IT AGAIN,BECAUSE ALL THE ANRGY FLOS AMOUNTEND AROUND ANAROUND AROUND THE RIV ANGLES BACK TOR THE BATARYN DOESIT AGAIN
2500,CAUSE IF THE SWITCH IS CLOSED THAT MEANS THE CIRCUIT WORKS CAUSE IT'S AN ELECTROMAGNET,CAUSE IF THE SWITCH IS CLOHED THAT MEANS THE CIRCUT WORKSCAUSE HIT'S AN LLECTRAL MAGNET
2501,EVERYTHING WILL FLY UP,EVERYTHING WILL FLY UP
2502,CLO HO HOSE,CLO E HOS
2503,SO ALL THE ENERGY CAN COME AND STICK TOGETHER,SO ALL THE ANARGY CAN COME AND STICK TOGETHER
2504,THAT MEANS IT'S AN OPEN CIRCUIT,THAT MEANS IS AN OPEN CIRCUT
2505,BECAUSE THE ENERGY IS IT'S BECAUSE IT'S CALLED AN ELECTROMAGNET DUM DUM,BECAUSE THE ENARGY IS IT'S BECAUSE IT'S CALLED AN ALECTRA MAT DUMEDT
2506,ENERGY,ANEARGY
2507,ELECTROMAGNET MAGNETS,ELECTRAL MANET MAGNETS
2508,IT'S CALLED A RIVET,ITS CALLED A RIV
2509,THE WASHERS ARE GETTING STUCK BY THE THING DUH,THE WATCHERS ARE GETTING SA BY TE THING TH
2510,THE CIRCUIT IS UH IT'S A OPEN CIRCUIT NOW CAUSE THE SWITCH IS NOT ON,THE CIRKAE IS  IT'S A OPEN CIRCKET NOW BECAUSE THE SWISH IS NOT ON
2511,IT WILL JUST STICK TO EVERYTHING,IT WILL JUST STICK TO EVERYTHING
2512,IT WHEN IT'S CLOSED THAT MEANS ALL THE ENERGY FLOWS THROUGH A CLOSED CIRCUIT,IT WHEN IT'S CLOSE THAT MEANS ALL THE ENARGY FLOWSH THROUGH AND MAS HA CL SECOND
2513,THE CIRCUIT IS CLOSED SO THAT MEANS THERE'S NO OPEN SPACES,THE CIRCUT IS CLOSHED SO THAT MEANSTHRE'S NO OPEN SPACES
2514,IT WILL JUST FIR STICK RI,IT WOULD T THE STICK WO
2515,GOOD,GOOD
2516,THE CIRCUIT IS SWITCHED ON,THE CIRKETE I SWITCHED ON
2517,ALL THE METAL RINGS WILL STICK,ALL THE METAL RINGS WILL STICK
2518,A SHOW FLOW,A SHOWFLOOR
2519,I DESCRIBED IT AS AN OPEN CIRCUIT CAUSE THE MOTOR ISN'T SPINNING,I DESCRIBE IT AS AN OPEN CIRGATE BECAUSE THE MOTOR IS NEXPLING
2520,I DID IT UH HUH,I DIDY UHU
2521,IT WILL STOP,IT WILL STOP
2522,WELL MAGNETS CONNECT,MAGNETS CONECT
2523,THEY'RE ALL METAL OR STEEL OR COPPER,THERE ALL MEDL OR STEEL OR COPER
2524,CAUSE WHENEVER I TAP ON SOMETHING METAL IT WILL SPIN BECAUSE LIKE IT'S METAL IT'LL WILL ALWAYS SPIN,CAUSE WHENEVER IT TAP ON SOMETHING MEDL IT ILL SPIN BECAUSS LIKE IT'S MEDDALE ANI WILL ALWAYS SPING
2525,IT'S A CIRCUIT,IT'S A CIRCUE
2526,IT STOPS,IT STOPS
2527,INSULATORS AND CONDUCTORS,INSTILLATORS AND CONDUCTORS
2528,AN OPEN CIRCUIT WAIT A BY CIRCUIT,AN OPENED CIRC WAIT A CLOSE CIRCTE
2529,WELL THEY'RE ALL METAL SO THAT'S HOW IT WILL GO CAUSE THAT'S HOW IT WILL POWER A MOTOR,EAING T AMINAU CIRCATE IS LIKE
2530,INSULATORS ARE NOT METAL BUT CONDUCTORS ARE,INSTLATORS ARE NOT METLE BUT CONDUCTORS ARE
2531,INSULATORS ARE METAL,INSTILATORS ARE MET
2532,UH HELLO,HELLO
2533,IT'S NOT SPINNING,IT'S NOT SPANING
2534,IT WILL NOT SPIN,IT WILL NOT SPIN
2535,ALRIGHT A CONDUCTOR IS METAL SO IT WILL REPOW,OR A CONDUCTOR HIS MEDAL SO RPOUDE
2536,PLUS AND MINUS MEANS THIS SIDE OR THE NEGATIVE SIDE,LESNT MINUS MEANS HESIDE OR THE NIGITIVE SIDE
2537,THE TWO,THE TWO
2538,IT'S SPINNING,IT'S SPENING
2539,THE ELECTRICITY IS FLOWING THROUGH A WIRE AND INTO ANOTHER,THE LEKE TRISCIES FLOWING THROUGH A WIRE AND INTO ANOTHER
2540,THE SYMBOL THE LIGHT B,DECIMBLE THE LIGHTE

2584,THEY'RE NOT ALL THE SAME THEY'RE A LITTLE DIFFERENT A LITTLE DIFFERENT WAY,THEN O ALL THESTIN THERE A LITTLE DIFFERENNT A LITTLE DIFERENT WAY
2585,THIS ONE'S LONGER THAT THE OTHERS AND UM YOU ONLY SHOULD CHANGE ONE VARIABLE AT A TIME,THIS ONES LONGER THAN THE OTHERS AND UHM YOU ONLY SHOULD CHANGE ONE VERY LLL AT OF TIME
2586,SINCE IT'S SMALLER IT GOES FASTER,SINCE IT SMALLER  IT GOES FAST
2587,IT'S LIKE THE OTHER ONE THE SHORTER THE STRING IS THEN THE HIGHER THE AMOUNT OF SWINGS ARE,IT'S LIKE THE OTHER ONE THE SHORT OF THE STRINGING IS THE THE HIGH AIR THE MOU  SWINGS ARE
2588,HOW MANY TIMES THE PENDULUM SWINGS BACK AND FORTH,HOW MANY TIMES THE PENDAL LUMS SWINGS BACK AND FORTH
2589,WE TAPED A PENCIL TO OUR DESK AND THEN WE LET IT SWING BACK AND FORTH AND SEE HOW MUCH HOW MANY TIMES IT SWING IT SWINGS BACK AND FORTH UM IN TWELVE SECONDS,WE TAPED A PENCIL TO OUR JESK AND THEN WE LET IT SWING BACK AND FORTH AND SEE HOW MUCH HOW MANY TIMES IT SWI IT SWING BACK AND FORTH UHM AND TWELVE SECONDS
2590,ACTUALLY THE BIGGER IT GETS THE MORE SWINGS IT HAS,ACTUALLY THE THE BIGGER IT GETS THE MORESE TLINGS AT HAT
2591,UM WE MADE A PENNY WITH SO IT WENT BACK AND FORTH LIKE A PENDULUM,UHM WE MADE A HENY WITH SO IT WENT BACK AND FORTH LIKE A PEN
2592,THEY BOTH HAVE A PENNY AT THE END,THEY BOTH HAVE A PENY AT THE END
2593,A FEW DAYS AGO WE FLEW PAPER AIRPLANES,A FEW DAYS AGO WELUE PAPER EARPLANES

2624,GOOD,GID
2625,WE ADDED T WELL YOU ADDED TOO MANY PAPER CLIPS AT A TIME THEN YOU TOOK T TOO MANY OUT OF IT UH TOO MANY OFF,WRE ADDET WELL D YOU ADDED TO MANY PAPER CLIBS AT A TIME THEN YOU TOOK T TO MANY AT T AT TO MINY OF
2626,WELL THE MORE THE LESS PASSENGERS YOU HAVE THE LONGER THE DISTANCE WILL BE AND THE MORE PASSENGERS YOU HAVE IT WON'T GO AS FAR,WELL MORE THE LESS PASSENGERS YOU HAVE THE LONGER THE DISTANCE WILL BE AND THE MORE PASSENGERS HAVE IT WON'T GO AS FAR
2627,WE MADE FOUR PAPER BOATS AND SEE HOW MANY HOW MUCH WATER THEY CAN HOLD AND HOW MUCH PENNIES IT CAN HOLD,WE MADE FOUR PAPER BOATS AND SEE HOW MANY HOW MUCH WATER THEY CAN HOLD AN HOW MUCH PENNYS I CAN HOLD
2628,SIZE IS COM UH MATTER WHAT HOW MUCH WATER IT CAN HOLD THE SIZE IS YOU KNOW KIND A DETERMINE WHAT HOW MUCH WATER IT CAN HOLD,RIZESCOM  MATTER WHAT HOWMUCH WATER IT CAN HOLD TE SIZEES YU KNOW CAND A DETURMEN WHAT HOW MUCH WATER I CAN HOLD
2629,TO HOLD PENNIES AND SEE HOW MUCH WATER IT COULD HOLD,TO HOLD PENIES AND SEE HOW MUCH WHT IT CULD HOLD
2630,UM LET'S SEE IF YOU DROP THE PENNIES IN YOU CAN HAVE LESS YOU'LL PROBABLY HAVE LESS AND IF YOU STACK EM ON ONE SIDE YOU CAN HAVE MORE BUT IF YOU STACK EM ON THE EDGE IT'LL TIP OVER AND YOU COULD HAVE LESS,UHM LET'S SEE IF YOU DROP THE PENY SIN YOU CAN HAVE LESS YOU' PROBLY HAVE LESS TAND IF YOU STACK HIM ON ONE SIDE YOU CAN HAVE MORE BUT IF YOU STACK THIM ON THE EDGE O TIP OVER AND YOU CUN HAVE LESS
2631,WELL WE PUT,WELL WE PUT
2632,IF YOU MADE THEM ALL THE SAME YOU WOULDN'T KNOW IF YOU MADE EM A SMALLER OR BIGGER SIZE THAT THEY COULD HOLD MORE OR LESS,IF YOU MADE THEM ALL THE SAME YOU WOULDN'T KNOW IF YOU MADE HIM A SMALLER OR BIGER SIZE THAT THEY COULD HOLD MORE R LESS
2633,CAPACITY IS UH HOW MUCH WATER IT CAN HOLD AND IF,AITY IS THAT HOW MUCH WATER CAN HOLD AN IF
2634,IF YOU PUT EM ALL OVER THE PLACE THEN IT WON'T STAY UP THAT HARD FAR AND IT'LL JUST SINK BUT IF YOU PUT THEM LIKE IN THE MIDDLE AND STACK EM YOU CAN FIT MORE PENNIES,IF YOU PUT THEM ALL OVER THE PLACE THEN IT WIL STAY UP THAT HART FA AND I'LL JUST THINK BUT IF YOU PUT THEMI LIKE IN THE MIDDLE AND STACK THEM YOU CAN FIT MORE PENIES
2635,IF YOU PUT IT ON THE SIDE IT'LL SINK AND IF YOU PUT IT IN THE MIDDLE YOU CAN HOLD MORE PENNIES,IF YOU PUT IT ON THE SID EL SINK AND IF YOU PUT IT IN THE MIDDLE YOU CAN HOLD MORE PENIES
2636,PAPER CUPS,PAPER CUTS
2637,IF THEY'RE SMALLER THEY WON'T HOLD AS MUCH AND IF THEY'RE BIGGER THEY'LL HOLD MORE,IF THEYR RE SMALLER THEY WON'T HOLD AS MUCH AND IF THE'RE BIGER THE'L HOLD MORE
2638,WE PUT THE WA,WE PUT THE
2639,THE SMALLER ONES DON'T HOLD AS MUCH WATER AND PENNIES BUT THE TALLER ONES AND THE BIGGER ONES HOLD MORE,THE SMALLER ONES DON'T HOLD AS MUCH WATER AND PENIES BUT THE TALLER ONES TAND THE BIGER ONES HOLD MORE
2640,WE'RE GONNA S WE S SEE HOW MANY CAPACITY IT CAN HOLD AND HOW MANY PENNIES THEY COULD HOLD,ORCAN S WE  SEE HOW MUCH COPASITY THET CAN HOLD IN TE HOW MANY PENIES THEY COULD HULD
2641,GOOD,GED
2642,BETTER AND HOLD MORE,BETTERN HOLD MORE
2643,YOU'RE WELCOME,YOU'RE WELCKOME
2644,IF THE WATER'S TOO ROUGH THE BOAT COULD TIP OVER BUT IF IT'S CALM IT'LL BE EASIER TO PUT THE PENNIES AND IT'LL STAY UP,IF THE WATER I'S TOO RUF THE BOAT CAN'T TIPP OVER BUT IF ITS CLM WILL BE EASIER BUT THE PENYES THAND IT WILL STAY UP
2645,THEN WE UM WE WOULD KNOW HOW MUCH WATER IT WOULD HOLD,N THE BOT AND SEE HOW MUCH IT COULD HOLD AND UHM IF WHEN IT ONCE A GO  WENT OVER OR IT SONG THA THEN WE
2646,THE S THE SMALLER ONES WELL THE SMALLER ONE WON'T HOLD AS MUCH AND THE BIGGERS ONE WILL,THE S THE SMALLER ONES WILL THE SMALLER ONE WON'T HOLD AS MUCH IN THE BIGER S ONE WILL
2647,HOW WIDE AND HOW TALL THE BOAT IS,HOW WHI DAN'T HOW TALL ABOUT IS
2648,IF YOU PUT EM ALL ON ONE SIDE IT'LL SINK BUT IF YOU PUT IT IN THE MIDDLE THEY'LL STAY EVEN AND YOU CAN HOLD MORE PENNIES,IF YOU PUT HIM ALL ON ONE SIDE I'L SINK BUT IF YOU PUT IN THE MIDDLE THEY 'LL STAY EVEN AND YOU CAN HOLD HMORE PENIES
2649,THE UM THE CAP,THAT UM LIOK
2650,THANK YOU,THANK YOUT
2651,F YOU DROP THEM IN IT MIGHT NOT HOLD AS MUCH BUT IF YOU SET EM IN AND YOU KEEP THEM EVEN IT'LL HOLD MORE,OU DROPP THE MIN IT MIGHT NOT HOLD AS MUCH BUT IF YOU SETTHALMIN AND YOU KEEP THIM EVE AND I'L HOLD MORE
2652,WE MADE FOUR DIFFERENT SIZES TO SEE UM WHICH ONE WOULD,WE MADE FOUR DIFERENT SIZES TO SEE WHICH ONE WOULD
2653,IF YOU LIKE PUT THEM ON ONE SIDE IT WOULD SINK OVER IF YOU BALANCE EM IT MIGHT HA BE ABLE TO HOLD MORE,IF YOU LIKE PUT THEM ON ONE SIDE IT WOULD SINK OVER IF YOU BOUNCE TOM IT MIGHT HAV BEABLE TO HOLD MORE
2654,THEY'RE ABOUT WHEN WE'RE TRYING TO SEE UM W HOW MANY PENNIES CAN FIT INTO IT WITHOUT IT SINKING AND UM,AND HOW MUCH WATER IT CAN GO OVER C IT CAN FIT  BEFORE IT GOES OVER
2655,IF YOU CHANGE TOO MANY,IF YOU CHANGE TWO MINU
2656,WE UM WE MADE FOUR BOATS OUT OF PAPER CUPS AND WE HAD TO MAKE IT BETWEEN ONE CENTIMETER AND FOUR CENTIMETERS,WE UHM WE MADE FOUR BOATS OUT OF PAPER CUPS AND WE HAD TO MAKE IT BETWEEN ONE SEND METEUR AND FOUR SEN METERS
2657,PAPER CUPS,PAPER CUPS
2658,IF YOU DON'T USE ACCURATE MEASUREMENTS THEN IT COULD UM LET'S SAY YOU DO ONE THAT'S EIGHT CENTI,IF YOU DON'T USEH ACURAT MEGURMENTS THEN IT COULD UHM LET'S SAY YOU DO ONE THAT'S EAGHT SEND
2659,UM THERE WE DESIGNED THEM TO HOLD PENNIES AND TO HOLD A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF WATER AND TO SEE HOW UM MUCH WATER THEY COULD HOLD,UHM THER WE DESINED THEM TO HOLD PENIES AND TO HOLD USRINIMOUOF WATER AND TO SEE HOW UHM MUCH WATER THEY GET HOLD
2660,OKAY I'M NOT SURE ON THIS ONE,OOK I'M NOT SURE I'M THIS ONE
2661,IF THE WATER IS LIKE HA IT'S REALLY TALL WAVES IT'LL KNOCK EM OVER BUT IF IT'S CALM AND KIND OF FLAT AND JUST SITTING THERE THEN IT'LL BE EASIER TO STACK THEM,IF THE WATER IS LA HS REALLY TALL WAVES AND WE'LL NOCK A MOVER BUT IF IT'S CALME AND KIND OF FLAT AND JUST SITTING THERE THEN T'LL BE EASIER TO STACK THEM
2662,IF YOU ONLY CHANGE IF YOU CHANGE ONE VARIABLE AT A TIME IT WILL BE EASIER TO SEE IF YOU'RE DOING IT RIGHT OR WRONG,IF YOU ONLY CHANGE IF YOU CHANGE ONE VAORIBLE ATA TIME O'LL BE EASIER TO SEE IF YOU'ARE DOING IT RIGHT O WRONG
2663,THAT IF YOU STACK EM IT WILL STAY EVENLY AND THAT IT COULD HOLD MORE AND IF YOU JUST KIND OF PUT THEM ALL OVER THE PLACE IT DOESN'T REALLY WORK THAT WELL WITHOUT SINKING,THAT IF YOU STOCK THEM I'LL STAY EVENLY AND THEN IT COULD HOLD MORE AND IF YOU JUST KIND OF PUT THEM I'L OVER THE PLACE IT DOESN'T REALLY WORK THAT WELLE WITHOUT THINKING
2664,YOU'RE ONLY STACKING ON ONE SIDE AND IF YOU STACK EM ON ONE SIDE IT'S GONNA SINK IF YOU STACK EM IN THE MIDDLE LIKE THE ONE ON THE LEFT IT'LL STAY UP LONGER,YOU'RE ONLY STACK ING ONE ONE SIDE AND IF YOU ACK HIM ON ONE SIDE IT'S GOING TO SINK IF YOU STUCK HIM IN THE MIDDLE LIKE THE ONE ON THE LEFT IT'LL STAY UP LONGER
2665,IF LET'S SEE UM WE'RE,IF LET' SEE U ROC
2666,I CAN'T I'M NOT SURE,WI CAN'T I'M NOT SURE UHM
2667,TO SEE WHICH ONE WOULD WORK BETTER IF THE SMALLER ONE OR THE MEDIUM SIZED ONE OR THE BIGGER ONE AND SO WE COULD JUST CHOOSE DIFFERENT KINDS AND SEE WHAT THE RESULTS ARE FOR DIFFERENT ONES,TO SEE WHICH ONE WOULD WORK BETTER IF THE SMALLER ONE OR THE METIEUM SIZE ONE OR THE BIGER ONE AND SO WE COULD JUST CHOSE DIFERENT KIND TO SEE WHAT THE RESOLTS ARE FOR DIFERENT ONES
2668,THAT THE SMALLER ONE MIGHT HOLD LESS AMOUNT OF PENNIES AND THEN THE MEDIUM WILL HOLD A LITTLE MORE AND A LITTLE MORE AND A LITTLE MORE,THAT THE SMALLER ONE MIGHT HOLD LESS TAMOUT OF PENIES AND THEN THE MEEDIUM  HOLD A LITTLE MORE AND A LITTLE MORE IN A LTTLE MORE
2669,IF YOU ONLY CHANGE ONE THING AT A TIME IT MIGHT BE EASIER TO SEE IF THAT THING MADE IT WORSE OR BETTER,IF YOU ONLY CHANGE ONE THING AT A TIME IT MIGHT BE EASIYER TO SEE IF THAT THING MADE IT WORK OR BETTER
2670,IF YOU SET THEM DOWN IT MIGHT BE EASIER TO PUT MORE IN IF YOU KIND A JUST DROP EM IN IT MIGHT YOU KNOW MAKE IT SINK,IF YOU SET THEM DOWN IT MIGHT BE EASIER TO PUT MORE IN IF YOU KIND O JUST DROPAMANT IND MIGHT YOU KOW MAKE IT STINK
2671,UM LET'S SEE IF W,U LET'S E FW
2672,AT ONE TIME YOU COULD,THAT ONE TIME YOU COU
2673,IF THEY'RE SMALLER THEN IT'LL BE HARDER TO PUT MORE PENNIES IN AND IF THEY'RE BIGGER IT'LL BE EASIER SINCE THEY'RE TALLER AND YOU CAN PUT MORE PENNIES IN WITHOUT IT SINKING,IF THERE' SMALLER THAN IT'LL BE HARDER TO PUT MORE PENYES THAN AND IF THERE A BIGER TI'L BE EASIER SINCE THERE AR TALLER AND YOU CAN P MORE PENYS THAN WITHOUT IT SINKING
2674,IF YOU PUT THEM IN THE MIDDLE THEY'LL BE ABLE TO HAVE MORE SINCE IT'S BALANCED AND IF YOU PUT THEM KINDA EVERYWHERE IT'LL SINK FASTER,IF YOU PUT THEM IN THE MIDDLE WO'LL BE ABLE T HAVE MORE SINCE IT'S BOUNCED AND IF YOU PUT THEM KIND O EVERYWHERE I'LL SINK FASTER
2675,UM THE SMALLER ONES MIGHT NOT AS HOLD AS MUCH PENNIES BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT AS TALLER AND IT'LL OVERFLOW FASTER,UHM THE SMALLER ONES MIGHT NOT AS HOLD AS MUCH PENIES BECAUSE THEY NOT AS TALLER AND IT'LD OVERFLOW FASTER
2676,KNOW IF THEY'RE WRONG OR RIGHT,WT IF THEY WERE WRONG AD RIGHT
2677,YOU SHOULD STOP THERE BECAUSE IF YOU PUT ANY MORE IN YOU'LL PROBABLY OVERFLOW THE BOAT,YOU SHOULD STOP THERE BECAUSE IF YOU PUT ANY MORE AN YOU'L PROBLY OVERFLOW THE BOAT
2678,IF YOU WOULD LET'S SEE UM,IF YOU SAY UHM
2679,WITH STRING AND THEN THE OTHER ONE'S SUPPOSED TO BE EIGHT TOO BUT IF YOU DO ONE THAT'S ACCIDENTALLY NINE IT'LL END UP BEING A LITTLE DIFFERENT,SONG WAS STERING AND THEN THE OTHER ONE SUPOSED TO BE EIGHT TWO BUT IF YOU DO ONE THAT'S ACIDENTALY NINE L AND  BEING A LITTLE DIFFERENT
2680,UM IT WAS IMPORTANT TO MAKE SURE THERE'S DIFFERENT SIZES AND IF THEY WEREN'T DIFFERENT SIZES THEY WOULD JUST CARRY THE SAME AMOUNT OF WATER AND PENNIES,UHM IT WAS IMPORTAT TO MAKE SURE THEREAS DIFERENT SIZEES AND IF THEY WEREN'T DIFERENT SIZEES THEY WOULD JUST CARRY THE SAME AMOUNT OF WATER AND PENNIES
2681,WELL YOU SHOULD UM,WILLE YOU SAID UHM
2682,LIKE YOU COULD HAVE IF YOU ADDED TOO MANY THINGS YOU,LIKE YOU COULD HV IF YOU ADDED TO MANY THINGSYOU
2683,HOW MUCH HOW TALL THE BOAT WAS AND HOW WIDE IT WAS,HOW MU HOW TALL THE BOAT WASN'T HOW WHIDE IT WAS
2684,ONCE THE BOAT SUNK YOU TOOK ONE PENNY OUT AND THEN COUNTED HOW MANY PENNIES YOU HAVE LEFT AND SEE THAT'S HOW MANY PASSENGERS YOUR BOAT CAN HOLD,ONCE ABOUT SUNK YOU TOOK ONE PENY OUT AND THENN COUNTED HOW MANY PENYES YOU HAVE LEFT AND SEE THAT'S HOW MANY PASENGERS YOUR BOAT CAN HOLD
2685,WHEN THE BOAT,WHEN THE BOAT
2686,THAT THE DIFFERENCE IF THEY'RE WIDER OR TALLER THEY'LL WILL HOLD MORE WATER AND MORE PENNIES,THAT THE DIFFERENCE IF THEIRE WHITER OR TALLER THEY WILL HOLD MORE WATER AND MORE PENIES
2687,THE ONE THAT'S UNDER WATER HAS TOO MANY PENNIES BECAUSE THEY'RE ALL PILED UP AND THEY'RE SPREAD OUT BUT THE ONE UM THAT'S STILL ABOVE IS EVEN AND IT'LL BE EASIER,THE ONE THAT'S UNDER WATER HAS TO MEY PENIES BECASE THAYRE ALL PILED UP AND THEIRE SPREAD OUT BUT THE ONE UHM THAT' STILL ABOVE IS EVEN AND TI'LL BE EASIER
2688,CAUSE IF THEY WERE THE SAME THEN YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW IF YOU KNOW OTHER KINDS WOULD WORK BETTER OR WORK LESS,CAUSE IF THEY WERE THE SAME THEN YOU D'T WOULDN'T KNOW IF YOU KNOW OTHER KINDS WOULD WORKGETTHER OR WORK LESS
2689,WELL THE SMALLER ONE MIGHT BE UM MIGHT NOT AS M,WELL THE SMALLER ONE MIGHT BE UHM MIGHT NOT AS
2690,IF THE BOAT IS SMALLER IT'LL BE HARDER TO PUT THE PENNIES IN SINCE IF IT HAD MORE PRESSURE AND WEIGHT ON IT AND IT'S NOT AS TALL AND IT'LL SINK WITH MORE LESS PENNIES,IF THE BOAT WIS SMALLERE ILL BE HARDER TO PUT THE PENIE'S INSENCE IF I HAD MORE PRESSURE AND WAIT ON IT ANDS NOT AS TALL AND IT'LL SINK WITH MORE LESS PENYES
2691,U,
2692,THIS WEEK IN SCIENCE WE'VE BEEN WORKING ON THE CAPACITY OF BOATS WITH LITTLE PAPER CUPS AND WE'VE BEEN SEEING HOW MUCH WATER THEY CAN HOLD AND HOW MUCH PENNIES THEY CAN HOLD,THIS WEEK IN SCIENCE WE'VE BEEN WORKING ON THE COPASITY OF BOATS WILL LITTLE PAPER CUPS AND WE'VEBEEN SEING HOW MUCH WATER THEY CAN HOLD ND HOW MUCH PENIES THEY CAN HOLD
2693,CAUSE IT DEPENDS HOW YOU PUT THE PENNIES IN IF YOU KIND OF DROP EM IN THEY MIGHT BE LESS IF YOU SET EM IN IT MIGHT BE EASIER IF YOU PUT EM ON ONE SIDE IT MIGHT BE HARDER TO DO THAT AND IF YOU STACK EM EVENLY IT MIGHT HAVE MORE,CAUSE IT DEPENDS HOW YOU PUT THE PENIES IN IF YOU KIND OF DROP THIM IN THEY MIGHT BE LESS IF YOU SETTLMEN WI'TD MIGHT BE EASIER IF YOU PUT THM ON ONE SIDE IT MIGHT BE HARDER TO DO THAT AND IF YOU STOCK HM EVEN LY IT MIGHT HAVE MORE

2729,GOOD,GED
2730,AND MAKING PLANES WITH STRAWS ON A PROPELLER AND WE TOOK THE STRING AND TIED IT TO TWO CHAIRS AND WIND UP THE PROPELLER AND SEE HOW FAR IT COULD GET,HEN MAKING PLEANS WITH DRAWS ON A PEPILLO AND WE TOOK THE STRING IND TIED IT TO TWO CHAIRS AND WINED UP THE PEOPILLO AND SEE HOW FAR IT COULD GET
2731,WHAT MAKES A PROPELLER SO,HAT MAKES UP A PLANS
2732,WELL YOU NEED TO THINK ABOUT HOW FAR YOU SHOULD SPREAD APART YOUR STRAWS AND WHAT KIND OF STRING YOU SHOULD USE AND HOW MANY TIMES YOU UH WIND UP THE PROPELLER,WELL YOU NEED TO THINK OF ILL HOW FAR YOU THOUD SPREAD PART YOUR STRAWS AND WHAT KIND OF STRIAM YOU SHOULD USE AND HOW MEY TIMES YOUA WIND UP THE PERPELLER
2733,HELLO,
2734,WHAT'S IMPORTANT IS THE BODY THE PROPELLER AND WHAT THE STRING AND WHAT'S HOLDING IT UP,WHAT'S IMPORTANT IS THE BODY THE PERPELLER AND WHAT THE STRING AND WHAT'S HOLDING IT UP
2735,WELL HOW HOW BIG THE BOAT IS AND HOW TALL IT IS AFFECTS HOW MUCH PASSENGERS IT CAN HOLD,WELL HOW HOW BIG THE BOAT ISN'T HOW TALL IT IS AFECTS HOW MUCH PASENGERS IT CAN HOLD
2736,WE'VE BEEN MAKING PAPER BOATS AND SEEING THE CAPACITY AND HOW MUCH PASSENGERS THEY CAN HOLD AND WE'VE BEEN DOING GRAPHS,WE A'VE BEEN MAKING PAPER BOATS AND  CING THE COPASITY N HOW MUCH PASMEGURES THEY CAN HOLD IN TH WEEP IEN DOING GRAFTS
2737,WELL IT DEPENDS OF THE SIZE OF THE BOAT HOW MUCH IT CAN HOLD AND HOW MUCH YOU WOULD BE ABLE TO ESTIMATE HOW MUCH YOU CAN IT COULD HOLD,WELL IT DEPENDS ON THE SIZE OF THE BOAT HOW MUCH IT CAN HOLD IN HOW MUCH YOU WD BE ABLE TO ASK MATE HOW MUCH YOU CAN IT COULD HOLD
2738,IF YOU CHANGE TOO MANY AT ONE TIME THEN YOU WON'T KNOW IF YOU GOT IT RIGHT AT THE BEGINNING OR THAT YOU HAD TOO MANY CHANGE OR YOU HAD JUST RIGHT AMOUNT OF CHANGE,IF YOU CHANGE TO MANY AT ONE TIME THEN YOU WON'T KNOW IF YOU GOT IT RIGHTS AT THE BEGINING OR THAT YOU HAD TOO MANY CHANGER YOU HAD JUST RIGHT MOUTHCHAINGE
2739,WELL THE YOU CAN YOU CAN FIND THAT MAYBE ONE IT LIKE ONE BOAT CAN HOLD MORE PASSENGERS TH AND ONE CAN HOLD LESS BUT IT DEPENDS ON THE SIZE,WELL THAT YOU CAN YOU CAN FIN THAT MAYBE ONE IT LIKE ONE BOAT CAN HOLD MORE PASENGERISTI THAND ONE CAN HOLD LESS BU IT DEPENDS ON THE SIZE
2740,THE HIGHER IT GETS THE MORE PASSENGERS IT GETS AND MORE CAPACITY IT CAN GET,THE HIGER IT GETS MORE PASENGERS THAT GETS IN MORE COPASITY IT CAN GET
2741,WHAT WE DID HERE IS WE WE FOUND ONE,WHAT WE DID HERE IS WE WE FOUND
2742,UM IF YOU CHANGE ONE VARIABLE THEN THE OTHER IF IT WORKS BETTER OR LESS THEN YOU DON'T HAVE TO CHANGE THE OTHER VARIABLE SO YOU ONLY CH SO CHANGE ONE AT A TIME,UHM IF YOU CHANGE ONE VERYABLE THAN THE OTHER IF IT WORKS BETTER OR LESS THAN YOU DON'T HAVE TO CHANGE THE OTHER VERYABLE SO YOU ONLY H SAID CHANGE ONE AT A TIME
2743,WE WERE IN CHARGE OF SEEING HOW MUCH CAPACITY IT CAN HOLD AND HOW MUCH PENNIES WE CAN HOLD AND WE DID FOUR DIFFERENT SIZES OF BOATS SO WE COULD SEE WHAT THE DIFFERENCE WAS,WE WEREN TIRED OF SAYING HOW MUCH COPASSITY I CAN HOLD AND HOW MUCH PENIES WE CAN HOLD AND WE DID FOUR DIFERENT SIZES AS A BOAT SO WE COULD SEE WHAT THE DIFFERENCE WAS
2744,WELL ON THE BOTTOM OF THE GRAPH IS HOW MUCH THE NUMBER OF PASSENGER NO YEAH IS THE NUMBER OF PASSENGERS THAT IT CAN,WELL IN THE BOTTOM OF THE GRAFT IS HOICH THE NUMBER OF PASENGER KNO YE IS THE NUMBER OF PASENGERS THAT I CAN
2745,WELL THE S SMALLER THE BOAT IS THE LESS PASSENGERS IT CAN HOLD,WELL THE S SMALLER THE BOAT IS THE LESS PASENGERS IT CAN HOLD
2746,GOOD,GED
2747,KAY YEAH,YE
2748,WELL WE,WEILLE WE
2749,THAT AS THE CAPACITY GETS HIGHER SO DOES THE NUMBER OF PASSENGERS,THAT AS LUCOPASITY GETS HIGHER SO DOS THE NUMBER OF PASENGERS
2750,WELL ON THE BOTTOM IS UH HOW MUCH CAPACITY IT CAN HOLD AND THE PASSENGERS AND THEN,ISUSUAL THE COPASITY AND THE PASSENGERS USUALLY STAY AROUND THE SAME MOUT AND THEY REALLY DON'T HAVE SOME BIG DIFFERENCE IN TAN
2751,WELL WE PUT DOWN HOW MUCH CAPACITY UNTIL WE GET TO THE HIGHEST NUMBER AND HOW MUCH THE PASSENGERS UNTIL WE GOT,WELL WE PUT DOWN HAMLITCHD COPASITY UNTIL WE GET TO THE HIGHST TUMBER AND HOW MUCH THE PASSENGERS UNTILL WE GOTT
2752,WELL THEY'RE PUTTING EM IN THE MIDDLE SO IT CAN HOLD MORE BUT IF YOU PUT EM ALL TO THE SIDE IT'LL TIP OVER UM WITH LESS AMOUNT IN PENNIES THAN IT ACTUALLY CAN HOLD,WELL THE'RE PUTTING H IN THE MIDDLE SO IT CAN HOLD MORE BUT IF YOU PUN ML TO DECIDE I' TIP OVER UHM WITH LESS A M PENDIES THAN I ACTUALLY CAN HOLD
2753,THE DIFFERENT SIZE OF THE CUP DEPENDS HOW MUCH CAPACITY IT CAN HOLD AND HOW MANY PASSENGERS IT CAN HOLD,THE DIFERENT SCIZE OF THE CUP DPENS HOW MUCH COPASIY CAN HOLD AND HOW MANY PASENGERS CAN HOLD
2754,WE,WE
2755,WELL WE DID FOUR DIFFERENT SIZES SO THAT WE COULD TELL WHICH ONE COULD HOLD MORE AND WHICH ONE COULD HOLD LESS,WELL WE DID FOR DIFERENT SIZEES SO THAT WE CULD T THELL WHICH ONE COULD HOLD MORE IN WHICH ONE COULD HOLD LAST
2756,ALRIGHT SO LET'S SEE,I  SO LET' SEE
2757,THAT THE MORE CAPACITY IT CAN HOLD THE MORE PASSENGERS,THAT THE MORE COPASITIY IT CAN HOLED THE MORE PASENGERS
2758,WE DID FOUR DIFFERENT SIZES OF BOATS SO WE COULD TELL WHICH SO IF WE DID ALL FOUR THE SAME WE WOULDN'T KNOW IF DIFFERENT SIZES COULD HOLD MORE OR LESS,WE DID FOR DIFERENT SIZE THE BOAT SO WE COULD TELL WHICH SO IF WE DID  ALL FOR THE SAME WE WOULD'T KNOW IFTHE DIFERENT SIZEES COULD HOLD MORE A LAS
2759,YOU WELL THAT THE MORE IF YOU LOOK AT THE PATTERN THE MORE THE CAPACITY IS THE PASSENGERS ALWAYS LESS THE CAPACITY IT CAN HOLD,BUT THE
2760,IT'S HOW CAPACITY IS HOW MUCH WATER IT CAN HOLD,ITS  COPASITYS HOW MUCH WATER CAN HOLD
2761,IT SHOWS YOU WHAT WHERE THE WHERE THE THE CAPACITY AND THE PASSENGERS MEET UP ON THE GRAPH,IT SHOWS YOU WHAT WHERE THE WHERE THE THE COPASITY IN THE PASSENGERIS MET UP AND THE GRAFT
2762,UH UM THEY'RE AND UH UM X AND THE Y ARE MATCHED UP SO THEY'RE PRETTY MUCH THE SAME,UHM THEIR BS LASN LSTINGS AND  U EX THE WHI ARE MATCHED UP SO THEI'RE PRETTY MUCH THE SAME
2763,WELL THE MORE YOU ADD THE PASSENGERS THE DISTANCE WILL IT IT WON'T GO AS FAR,WELL THE MORE AD THE PASENGERS THE DISTANCE WILL AN IT WON'T GO AS FAR
2764,SO YOU CAN UM,SO HE CAN UHM
2765,HELLO OH MY,HELLO
2766,OKAY BYE,OK BY
2767,WELL WE UM LISTED THE NUMBERS OF PASSENGERS AND THE DISTANCE AND WE REALIZED THAT THE MORE PASSENGERS YOU HAVE THE UM IT DOESN'T GO AS FAR,WELL WE UHM LISTE THE NUMBERS OF PASSENGERS AN THE DISTANCE AND REREALIZE THAT THE MORE PASSENGERS O HAVE THE UHM IT DOESN'T GO AS FAR
2768,WELL IT'S UM OTHER SIDE SO IT'LL BE EASIER TO LIST,WOLD PLACED LAKE ON THE THER SIDE IT WILL BE EASIER TO LIS THEM
2769,WE'VE BEEN MAKING PA WE'VE BEEN MAKING PLANES AND TESTING UM THEM AND SEEING WE'VE BEEN CHANGING SOME VARIABLES AND SEEING WHAT IT WOULD DO,WE'VE BEEN MAKING PEAP WE'VE BEEN MAKING PLEANS AND TESTING UH THEM AND SING WE'V BEEN CHANGING SOME FERIBALS AND SAING WO THE DOO
2770,THE NUMBER OF THE NUMBERS THAT IT GOES UP TO THE NUMBER OF PASSENGERS AND THE DISTANCE AND HOW FAR THAT GOES UP TO,THE NUMBER OFHE THE NUMBERS THAT IT GOES UP TO THE NUMBER OF PASNGERS AND THE DISTANCE AND HO FR  THAT GOS O TA
2771,WELL YOU PLACE THE Y THERE BECAUSE IT'S ON THE LINE OF THE AND THEN IT'LL BE IT'LL BE LIKE RIGHT THERE SO YOU IT'S EASIER,WELL YOU PLEASE  WHY THERE BECAUSE IT SOMEMOUD LINE OF THE RAD AN THEN IT'L BE IT'LL BE LIKE GOING THEY ARE SO U IT'S EASIER
2772,WELL X IS NUMBER OF MOTORS OR RUBBERBANDS AND Y IS THE DISTANCE,WELL EX IS NUMBER OF MOATORS THE RUBBER BANS AND WHY IS THE DISTANCE
2773,IT'LL GO PRETTY FAR,BANS 'LL GO PRETTY FAR
2774,WELL WE COULD CHANGE LIKE HOW MANY RUBBERBANDS WE HAD OR PUT ON SOME EXTRA PASSENGERS OR ME AND MY PARTNER MADE WINGS,WELL WE COULD CHANGE LIKE HOW MANY RUBER BANDS WE HAD OR PUT ON SOME EXTRA PASENGERS OR MEAN MY PARTONER MADE WINGS
2775,OKAY,OAK
2776,WELL YOU CAN,W YOU CAN
2777,WELL UM USUALLY IT DOESN'T MATTER BUT YOU HAVE TO LIKE LIST LIKE THE NUMBER OF PASSENGERS AND THE DISTANCE AND IT DOESN'T EXACTLY MATTER WHAT SIDE YOU PUT IT ON THOUGH,WELL UHM YUSUALLY ITDIDSN'T MATTER BUT YOU HAD THE LAKE LIST LIKE THE NUMBER OF PASSENGERS OF A DISTANCE AND DOESN'T EXACTLY MATTER WHAT SIE YOU PET IT ON THOUGH
2778,WELL THAT SO WE COULD TELL WHICH THE DIFFERENCE IS AND IT'LL BE EASIER TO EXPLAIN,WELL THAT SO WE COULD TELL WICH TO THE DIFFERENCES AND IT'L BE EASIER TO EXPLAINE

4046,MILLILITERS ARE LESS THAN A LITER SO THAT YOU CAN UM MEASURE THE VOLUME OF SOMETHING LESS THAN A LITER,MILLEADERSRE LESS THAN A LEADER SHOW THAT YOU CAN UHMMETTER THE VOLUME OF SOMETHING LESS THAN A LEADER
4047,YOU WOULD NEED TO UM WEIGH THEM AND LIKE WEIGH THEM AND THEN PUT THEM ON ON AND THEN PUT THEM IN ORDER FROM HEAVIEST TO LIGHTEST,WOULD NEED TO UHMND WEA THEM AND LIKE WE THEM AND THEN PUT THEM ON ON AND THEN PUT THEM IN OER FRM HEAVIYEST TO LAIHTEST
4048,IT'S THAT THE LIKE GRAY LINE A ADDS UP WITH THE LIKE ELEVATED BLUE SPACE,IT'S THAT THE LIKE GRAY LINE A AS UP WITH THE LK ELLIVATED BLUE SPACE
4049,THAT PICTURE IS OF A LITTLE IS OF A CUBE THAT IS ONE GRAM,THAT PICTURE IS OF A LITTLE IS OF A CUET THAT IS WON GRAND

4051,THE THEY'RE THE THEY PUT THE UM METAL CHIP IN ONE SIDE OF THE UM SCALE AND THEN THEY'RE PUTTING GRAMS IN TO SEE HOW MUCH IT WEIGHS,THE THERE THE THEY PUT THE UHM MEDDLE CHIP IN ONE SIDE OF THEUHM SCALE AND THEN THEY'RE PUTING GRAMS IN TO SEE HOW MUCH IT WAS
4052,BECAUSE THEN YOU'LL GET A MUCH MORE ACCURATE ANSWER THAN WITH YOUR HANDS,BECAUSE THEN YOU'LL GET A MUCH MORE ACURAT ANSWER THAN WITH YOUR HANDS
4053,YOU COULD DO IT BY IF YOU IF YOU WERE JUST ESTIMATING YOU COULD LIKE I WHAT I WROTE IS I THOUGHT THE HEAVIEST WAS THE UM METAL AND THEN THE PLASTIC AND THEN THE WOOD,YOU COULD DO IT BY IF YO IF YOU WERE JUST STIMATING YOU COULD LIKE I WHAT I ROPE IS I THOUGHT THE HEAVIEST WAS THE U MEDDTLE AND THEN THE PLASTIC AND THEN THE WOOD
4054,IT'S THAT UM THE MATERIALS WEIGH MORE AND THAT WHEN SOME MATERIALS WEIGH MORE THAN OTHER MATERIALS,IT'S THAT UHM THE MATERIALS WEAGT MORE AND  THAT WE SME MATERIALES WAY MORE THAN OTHER MTERIALS
4055,UM YOU ARE USING A SCALE TO MEASURE TO MEASURE THE WEIGHT OF THE PLASTIC DISK,UHM YOU ARE USING A SCAILE TO MEASURE TO MEASURE THE WAGHTE OF THE PLASTIC DISK

4093,WE USED A THERMOMETER TO SEE THE TEMPERATURE IN THE WATER,WE USED A THEIRMOMETER TO SEE THE TEMPEATURE IN THE WATER
4094,I THINK ABOUT IS IT HOT COLD OR JUST WARM,I THINK ABOUT IS IT HOT COLD OR JUST WARM
4095,SO THAT YOU CAN ALL KNOW THE EXACT TEMPERATURE OF THE WATER AND NOBODY WILL GET CONFUSED IN BETWEEN WHICH ONE IS WARMER AND WHICH ONE IS COLDER,SO THAT YOU CAN ALL KNOW THE EXACT TEMPEATURE OF THE WATER AND NOBODY WILL GET CONFUSED IND BETWEEN WHICH ONE IS WARMER IN WHICH ONE IS COLDER
4096,WE WERE SEEING HA WHICH CUP WAS WARMER AND WE FIGURED OUT THAT THE B CUP WAS THE COLDEST BUT A AND C WERE THE SAME TEMPERATURE,WE WERE SEINGA HAT WHITCH CUP WAS WARMER AND WE FIGURED OUT THAT THE BE CUP WAS THE COLDEST BUT A AND SEE WERE THE SAME TEMPERTURE
4097,IT'S WHEN IT'S HOT WHEN IT GOES UP AND IT'S COLD WHEN IT'S GO DOW WHEN IT GOES DOWN,IT'S WHEN IT'S HART WHEN IT GOS UP AND IT'S COLD WHEN IT'S GO DOWN WHEN IT GOES DOWN

4100,WE'RE MIXING THE ICE AND THE CO AND THE HOT WATER TOGETHER AND WE'RE GONNA GET A NEW TEMPERATURE OF WATER,WERE MIXING THE ICE AND THE COL IN THE HOT WATER TOGETHER AND WERE GOITO GET A NEW TEMATURE OF WATER
4101,WE PUT A THERMOMETER IN,WE PUT A SUBMOMETER IN
4102,YOU USE GRAMS,U USE GRANS
4103,I FOUND OUT THAT THE DRY SPONGE WAS THREE GRAMS AND THAT BUT THAT IT WAS THREE GRAMS,I FOUND OUT THAT THE DRY SPUND WAS THREE GRANS AND THAT WHAT THAUGHT IT WAS THREE GRAM

4110,I NOTICED THAT THE DRY SPONGE EQUALS THREE GRAMS,I KNOW JUCE THAT THE DRY SPENG EQULOATHE THREE GRANS
4111,YOU UM WHEN YOU DON'T YOU WOULD COUNT YOU COUNT THE GRAMS AND THE CUP WITHOUT THE SPONGE IN IT,YOU UHM WHEN YOU DON'T YOU WOULD CU YOU COUNT THE GRAMS AND THE CUP WITHOUT THE SPUNCH ION IT
4112,I NOTICED THAT UM THAT THEY WERE BALANCED AND THE WHITE THING WAS IN LINE WITH THE BLUE UM LINE,I NOTICED THAT UHM THAT THEY WERE BALLONCED AND THE WHITE THING WAS IN LINE WITH THE BLUE U LINE
4113,YOU CAN SEE HOW MUCH WATER THE SPONGE SOAKED UP BY UM DOING THE ANSWER YOU GOT MINUS THE WEIGHT OF THE DRY SPONGE,YOU CAN SEE HOW MUCH WATER THE SPUNCH SIAKED UP BY UHM DOING THE ANSWER YOU GOT MINUS THE WAIGHT OF THE DRY SPUNCH
4114,IT'S GOING GOOD THANK YOU,IT'S GON GOOD THANK YOU
4115,WE WERE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW MUCH THEY WEIGHED,WE WERE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW MUCH THEY WIED
4116,SO THESE OBJECTS THERE'S A DRY SPONGE A WET S SPONGE AND A SOAKED SPONGE AND THE DRY SPONGE IS THE LIGHTEST THEN THE WET SPONGE THEN THE SOAKED SPONGE IS THE HEAVIEST,SO THESE OBJECTS THERE'S A DRY SPUND WET'S  SPUNCH AND THA SIAKE SPUNCH AND THE DRY SPUN IS THE LIGHTEST THEN THE WET SPUND THEN THE SIAKE SPUNCH IS THE HEAVYEST

4118,WHEN YOU HAVE A BALANCE AND A SPONGE YOU CAN UM PUT THE SPONGE IN ONE SIDE AND PUT GRAM PIECES ON THE OTHER SIDE TO SEE HOW MUCH IT WEIGHS,WHEN YOU HAVE A BOUNCE ON A SPUNG YOU CAN UHM PUT THE SPUNGE IN ONE SIDE AND PUT GRANDPIECES ON THE OTHER SIDE TO SEE HOW MUCH IT WEAS
4119,I FOUND OUT THAT THE DRY SPONGE WHEN IT WHEN IT'S SOAKED ABSORBED LIKE UM LIKE TEN TIMES ITS OWN WEIGHT,I FOUND OUT THAT THE DRA SPEND WHEN IT WENT TO SIAKED ABSORBD LE U LIKE TEN TIMES AIT'S OWN WAIT
4120,IT'S WHEN IT STOPS ABSORBING WATER,IT'S WHEN IT STOPS ABSORBING WATER
4121,YOU CAN USE A BALANCE TO MEASURE THE WEIGHT AND THE MASS OF SOMETHING,YOU CAN UE THE BONCE TO MAURE THE WAITE AND THE MAS OF SOMETHING
4122,I FIGURED OUT THAT THE WET SPONGE WAS SIXTEEN GRAMS,I FIGURED OUT THAT THE WET SPUNCH WAS SIXTEEN GRAMS

4126,YOU WOULD NEED TO THINK ABOUT HOW LONG IS YOUR HAND OR YOUR FINGER AND THEN YOU CAN MEASURE IT,YOU WOULD NEED TO THINK ABOUT HOW LONG IS YOUR HANDO YOUR FINGER AND THEN YOU CAN MEASURE IT
4127,YOU WOULD USE CENTIMETERS,YOU WOULD USE CEIMUTORS
4128,IT TELLS YOU THAT IT'S ONE CENTIMETER WIDE,IT TELLS YOU THAT IT'S ONCE UND A MEETER WHIDE
4129,YOU USE MILLIMETERS WHEN SOMETHING IS SMALLER THAN A CENTIMETER,YOU'L USE MELLMETORS WHEN SOMETHING IS SMALLER THAN A SENTMETER
4130,AND GENERALLY USUALLY UM TWO THINGS ARE LIKE THE SAME HEIGHTH,AND GENRL USUALLY UHM TWO THINGS ARE LIKE THE SAME HIGTE
4131,THAT THE BIGGEST LIKE THING WITH CENTIMETERS ON IT IS A METER THEN IT GOES TO THE DECAMETER THEN A CENTIMETER THEN A ME MILLIMETER,THAT THE BIGEST LIKE THING WHI SE METER S ON IT IS A METER THEN IT GOS TO A DECKOMETER THAN A SENOMETER THAN A ME MITLE METER

4337,THE WEIGHT IS HEAVIER AND SO IT IS JUST A LOT EASIER TO USE,THE WAIT IS HEAVIER AND SO IT IS JUST A LOT EASIER TO UTH
4338,IT WILL HELP YOU KNOW THE EXACT SI THE EXACT WAY ABOUT IT AND IT'S VERY IMPORTANT,WILL HELP YOU KNOW THE EXACT SH THE EXACT WAT ABOUT IT AND IT'S VERY IMPORTANT
4339,IS FIGURING OUT HOW HEAVY IT IS TO MAKE SURE THEY ARE CORRECT,IS FIGURING OUT HOW HEAVY IT IS TO MAKE SURE THEY ARE CORECT
4340,THEY ALL ARE MADE OF DIFFERENT ME MATERIALS SO THEY MAKE DIFFERENT SO THEY WEIGH DIFFERENT THINGS,THEY ALL ARE MADE OF DIFFERENT M MATERIALS SO THEY MAKE DIFERENT SO THEY WEAT DIFERENT THINGS
4341,YES,S
4342,METAL IS HEAVIER THAN PLASTIC AND WOOD SO THAT MAKES IT HEAVIER,MEDL IS HEAVIER THAN PLASTICK IN WOOD SO THAT MAKES IT HAVIER
4343,I PUT THE THINGS IN THE BUCKETS TO SEE HOW HEAVY THEY WERE,I PUT THE THINGS IN THE BUCKETS TO SEE HOW HEAVY THEY ARE
4344,USE A SCALE,USE A SCALE
4345,SEE THERE'S EIGHT GRAMS IN THIS CUP SO THE CUP IS THIS METAL DISC IS EQUAL TO EIGHT GRAMS THAT'S HOW YOU CAN FIGURE IT OUT,SEETHERE'S EAGHT GRAMS IN THIS CUP SO THE CUP IS THIS METL DISK IS EUAL TO EAT GRANS THAT'S HOW YOU CAN FIGURE I OUT
4346,IT'S IMPORTANT TO GET THE ACCURATE MEASUREMENTS UNLESS Y IF YOU WANT TO GET IF YOU WANT TO KNOW HOW E MUCH SOMETHING WEIGHS N TO GET IF YOU'RE GOING TO BUY SOMETHING,IT'S IMPORTNT TO GET THE ACKURIT MESROMENTS UNLESS YOU IF YOU WANT TO GET IF YOU WANT TO KNOW HOW YOU HOW MUCH SOMETHING WAYS N TO G IF YOUARE GOING TO BIT SOMETHING
4347,I THINK THIS IS HAPPENING BECAUSE IT IS REPRESENTING THE ELECTRICITY,I THINK THIS IS HAPENING BECAUSE IT WAS REPRESENTING THE LLECTRISCITY
4348,IT IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE IF IF ONE LIGHT BULB DIES THEN THE OTHER STAYS,IT IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE IF IF ONE LIGHT WIL DIES THIN THE OTHER STAYS
4349,NO IT IS NOT DIFFERENT,NO IT IS NOT DIFFERENT
4350,THE PATHWAYS DON'T ONLY GO THROUGH THE METAL PART OF THE LIGHT BULB BUT THEY ALSO GO THROUGH THE FUSE OF THE LIGHT BULB,THE PATHWAYS DON'T ONLY GO THROUGH THE MEDDAL PART OF THE LIGHEBOL BUT THEY ALSO GO THROUGH THE FUSE OF THE LIBL
4351,A SERIES CIRCUIT IS AN ELECTRICAL CIRCUIT WITH ONLY ONE PATHWAY A PARALLEL CIRCUIT IS AN ELECTRICAL CIRCUIT WITH TWO MORE THAN ONE PATHWAY,A SEROUS CIRCUT IS AN ELLECTRICAL CIRCUT WITH ONLY ONE PATHWAY A PARLO CIRCUT IS A EN LECTRICAL CIRCUT WITH T MORE THAN ONE PATHWAY
4352,THAT IS REPRESENTING THE ELECTRICITY FLOWING THROUGH THE LIGHT BULBS,THAT IS REPRESENTING THE ELLECTRISCITY FLOWING THROUGH THE LIFEBOBS
4353,THEY ARE DIFFERENT FROM SERIES CIRCUITS BECAUSE THEY WOULD HAVE MORE THAN ONE PATHWAY AND SERIES CIRCUITS ONLY HAVE ONE PATHWAY,THEY ARE DIFFERENT FROM SERY CIRCUETES BECAUSE THEY WOULD HAVE MORE TAN ONE PATHWAY IN SERY CIRCUETES ONLY HAVE ONE PATHWAY
4354,YES I DID,YUSE I DID
4355,WE'VE BEEN LEARING ABOUT SERIES AND PARALLEL CIRCUITS,WE'VE BEN LEARNING ABOUT SERIES AND PARELOL CIRKUTS
4356,THE ELECTRICITY IS FLOWING FROM THE BATTERY TO ONE LIGHT BULB AND THROUGH THAT LIGHT BULB IT IS IT IS FLOWING THROUGH MORE WIRES TO ANOTHER LIGHT BULB,THE LLECTRISITY IS FLOWING FROM THE BATERY TO ONE LIBELB AND THROUGH THAT LIBB IT IS IT IS FLOWING THROUGH MORE WIERES TO ANOTHER LIBAL
4357,GOOD,GOOD
4358,THEY FLOW THROUGH THE R THEY FLOW THROUGH THE METAL AND THE LIGHT BULB HOLDERS,THEY FLOW THROUGH THE RO THEY FLOW THROUGH THE MEDDL ON THE LIGHEBULBHOLDERS
4359,IT IS A PARALLEL CIRCUIT BECAUSE THERE ARE TWO PATHWAYS,IT IS A PARLO CIRCET BECAUSE THERE ARE TWO PATHWAYS
4360,THERE ARE TWO PATHWAYS FROM THE LI FROM THE BATTERY THAT ARE GOING TO THE TWO DIFFERENT LIGHT BULBS,THERE ARE TWO PATHWAYS FROM THE L FROM THE BATERRY THAT ARE GOING TO THE TWO DIFFERENT LIBS
4361,I DISCOVERED THAT THE ELECTRICITY IS FLOWING THROUGH THE METAL ON THE LIGHT BULB HOLDERS,I DISCOVERE THAT THE LLECTRISCITY IS FLOWING THROUGH THE METAL ON THE LIHEOL HUOLDERS
4362,BY PATHWAYS I MEAN THE ELECTRICITY FLOWING THROUGH THE WIRES,BY PATHWAYS I MEAN THE LECTRISCITY FLOWING THROUGH THE WIRES
4363,THIS IS A SERIES CIRCUIT,THIS IS A SERIOUS CIRCUTE
4364,WE HAVE BEEN SEEING WHAT WILL WHAT KIND OF METAL WILL STICK TO MAGNETS,WE HAVE BEEN SEING WHAT WILL WHAT KIND OF METAL WILL STICK TO MAGNETS
4365,MAGNETS WILL JUST STICK TO ANYTHING THAT IS IRON OR STEEL,MAGNES WILL JUST TICK TO ANYTHING THAT IS IREN OR STEEL
4366,I MEAN LIKE UM THE MAGNET IS ATTRACTING THE PAPER CLIP,I MEAN LIKE U THE MAGNET IS ATRACTING THE PAPER CLIP
4367,YES I DID,E YES I DID
4368,WE FOUND OUT THAT IRON AND STEEL STICK TO MAGNETS,WE FOUND OUT THE IRN AND STEEL STICK TO MAGNETS
4369,THEN THE MAGNETISM WOULD NOT GO THROUGH TO THE OTHER MAGNET FROM ONE,THEN THE MAGNETIZOME WOULD NOT GO THROUGH TO THE OTHER MAGNET FROM ONE
4370,WE HAVE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT UM ELECTRICITY AND MAGNETISM,WE HAVE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT UHM ELECTRICITY AND MAGNETIZOM
4371,THE THING THAT SURPRISED ME THE MOST WAS MAGNETISM TRAVELLING THROUGH THE IRON OR STEEL OBJECT SO IT COULD PICK UP MORE OF THOSE THINGS,THE THING THAT SURPRISED ME THE MOST WAS MAGNETIZOM TRAVELING THROUGH THE IRN OR STEEL OBJECT  SO IT COULD PICK UP MORE OF THOSE THINGS
4372,THE TWO MAGNETS ARE STICKING TO EACH OTHER AND IF YOU'VE ONE MAGNET AROUND THEN THE OTHER ONE WILL FOLLOW IT,THE TWO MAGNETS ARE STICKING TO EACH OTHER AND IF YOU MOVE ONE MAGNET AROUND THEN THE OTHER WILL FLLOW IT
4373,GOOD,GOOD
4374,UM THE THE MAGNET IS PULLING THE PAPER CLIP THROUGH THE PAPER BUT IF IT'S TOO THICK IT WON'T WORK,UHM THE THE MAGNET IS PULLING THE PAPER CLIP THROUGH THE PAPER BUT IF IT'S TOO THICK IT WON'T WORK
4375,THEY ARE ATTR THEY'RE ATTRACTING AND AND IF IF YOU MOVE IT AROUND THEN THEY WILL STILL BE STICKING TOGETHER,THEY ARE ATTHEIRE ATRACTING AND AND IF IF YOU MOVE IT AROUND THEN THEY WILL STILL BE STICKING TOGETHER
4376,I MEAN TURN AROUND LIKE IT'S FACING THE OPPOSITE WAY THAT IT SHOULD BE,I MEAN TURN AROUND LIKE ITS FACING THE OPOSITE WAY THAN SHOULD BE
4377,I MEAN LIKE UM BREAK THE FORCE OF ATTRACTION,I MEAN LIKE UHM BREAK THE FORCE OF ATTRACTION
4378,WE LEARNED THAT THE THE BIGGER NUMBER OF SPACERS THE LESS WASHERS IT WOULD TAKE TO BREAK THE FORCE OF ATTRACTION,WE LEARNED THAT THE THE BIGER NUMBER OF SPACURES THE LESS WASHEURS IT WOULD TAKE TO BREAK THE FORCE OF ATRACTION
4379,THE MAGNET IS S STUCK TO NAIL AND AND THE MAGNETISM IS TRAVELLING THROUGH THE NAIL SO THE NAIL WOULD STICK TO THE PAPER CLIP AND IT'S CALLED THE TEMPORARY MAGNET,THE MAGNET IS STUCK TO THE NAIL AND AND THE MAGNETIZOM IS TRAVELING THROUGH THE NAIL SO THE NAIL WOULD STICK TO THE PAPER CLIP AND THT'S CALLED A TEMPERARY MAGNET
4380,IT WON'T STICK TO ALUMINUM CHROME OR UM TIN,IT WON'T STICK TO A LOMINUM CROAM OR U TINT
4381,INTESTINES ABSORB NUTRIENTS AND WATER INTO THE BLOODSTREAM AND COMPACT SOLID WASTE,TESTINS WAS OR NUTRANCE AND WATER INTO THE BLUD STREAM AND COMEPACT SOI SOLID WASTE
4382,THEY'RE BOTH THE DIGESTIVE SYSTEM I THINK,THE'RE BOTH  THE GIAESTA SISTOM I THINK
4383,I NOTICE THAT THEY BOTH HAVE DOTS BUT THE OTHER ONE ONE OF THEM HAS LIKE HAS LIKE SQUARES AND STUFF AROUND IT BUT THE OTHER JUST HAS JUST IS JUST YEAST JUST,I NOTICED THAT THEY BOTH HAVE DOGS BUT THE OTHTHER ONE ONE OF THEM HAS LIKE HAS LIKE SQUARES AND STLFF ROUN IT BUT THE OTHER ONE JUST HAVE JUST AS JAS SS J
4384,IT MOVES FOOD DOWN INTO THE STOMACH LIKE AFTER YOU CHEW IT IT GOES DOWN IN THE ESOPHAGUS TO GO INTO THE STOMACH TO GO INTO THE SMALL INTESTINE TO GO INTO BIG INTESTINES AND TO GO INTO THE WASTE,IT MOVES FWD DOWN INTO THE STUMICC LIKE AFTER YOU'D CHEW IT IT GOES DOWN THE SOPIGUES TO GO INTO THE STUMING TO GO IN THES LAWTESTANS OGO IN TO THE BIGCESTANSAL TO COM INTO THE WAST
4385,I DON'T KNOW WHAT'S UP WITH IT,I DON'T KNOW WHAT'S UP WAT IT
4386,I SEE SKIN CELLS,I SEE SKINSELVES
4387,STOMACH FURTHER BREAKS DOWN FOOD THROUGH MECHANICAL AND CHEMICAL,TOMIG FORTHER BREAKES TOWN FOOD THROUGH MMEMCANICAL AND CEMICAL A
4388,SAYS THAT MOUTH BREAKS BREAKS FOOD DOWN IN SMALLER PIECES WITH TEETH AND SALIVA I ALREADY KNEW THAT BY WATCHING A VIDEO JUST TO LET YOU KNOW,TES THAT MOUTH WOULDASDONT BREAKS FO DOWN IN SMALLER PIECES WITH TEETH AND SALIVA I ARADLY KNEW THAT BY WATSHING A IDEL JUST LUDGH
4389,THE HUMAN AND THE PLANT ALSO DIFFERENT I DON'T KNOW THEY'RE JUST,THE HUMAN IN THE PLANTS ALSO DIFFEREN I DON'T KNOW THERE JUST
4390,UHM THAT IT'S LIVING AND HUMANS ARE LIVING SO THEY'RE BOTH LIVING,UHM THAT IT'SLYBINAND HUMANS ARE LIVING SO BOTH THE BIG
4391,THIS THIS PICTURE IS THE DIGESTIVE SYSTEM LEARNING ABOUT THE DIGESTIVE SYSTEM AND THIS THIS THING HERE IS THE DIGESTIVE SYSTEM FOR THE BUTTERFLY,THIS BIG THIS PICTURE IS THE DIHT JUST AS LEARNING ABOUT THE JU'S JUSTIF TISTUME AND THIS S THE THING HERE IS THE JAR JUSTI SSTONE FOR THE BTTERFLY
4392,IT'S SHOWING US LIKE EVERYTHING ABOUT HOW IT WORKS YEAH STUFF LIKE THAT,IT'S SHOWING  HIS LEG EVERYTHINGI THINK ABOUTI THERE WERE WORD YEA IT'S TO LIKE THAT
4393,I'M GOOD,I'M GOOD
4394,IT GOES THROUGH LIKE THE SMALL INTESTINE AND IT GOES TO THROUGH TO THE BIG INTESTINES TO COME INTO THE WASTE AND THEN IT GOES OUT,IT GOES THROUGH LIKE THE SMALL TESTINS HAND T GOES TO THE T TO THE BIG ANTESTINS TO COME INTO THE WAST AND THEN IT GOS OUT
4395,I NOTICE MUSCLE OR WHATEVER THAT THOSE LITTLE THINGS ARE THAT ARE IN THE LIKE LEG,I NOTICED MUSCLE OR WHATEVER THA INES ARE THAT REIN THE LAKE
4396,NOTHING I DON'T KNOW,NOTHING I DON'T KNOW
4397,I THINK IT'S SHOWING US THE DIGESTIVE SYSTEM AND HOW THE REST OF YOUR BODY'S LIKE THE LITTLE INTESTINES AND THE BIG INTESTINES AND IT GOES THROUGH AND IT BECOMES WASTE,I THINK IT'S SURLY S THE DED JUST TIS IS TONE AN H WHAN THE OS  OS LIKE THE LITTLE CHESTINS OF N THE BIG NCESTINENICLE E BECOMES MACED
4398,WE'VE BEEN STUDYING ABOUT,WE'VE BEN SETTING NG ABOUT ME
4399,THE STOMACH IT HOLDS LIKE ALL OF THE FOOD THAT GOES DOWN THE ESOPHAGUS AND THEN IT GOES INTO THE SMALL INTESTINE WELL IT'S ALL OF THE FOOD THAT YOU CHEW DOWN,THE STUM MAKE IT HOLLDS LIKE ALL OF THE FOOD THAT GOES DON THE ASOPICEST AND THEN IT GOES INTO THSO HOLEDS POLL OF O FOOD THAT YOU CHEWT DOWN

4573,MMM HMM AND THAT IT HA WAS PRETTY HEAVY,AND THAT IT WAS PRETY HEAVY
4574,YEAH,YEA
4575,TWENTY ST IT COULD ABSORB E SEVENTEEN TIMES AS MUCH,TWENTY S IT COULD OBSORVE EIGHT SEVENTEEN TIMES AS MUCH
4576,THEY'RE PROBABLY IS BUT I DON'T REMEMBER IT,THER PROBLEM IS BUT I DON'T REMEMBER IT
4577,WE UM BUILT OUR BOATS OUT OF LITTLE PAPER CUPS WITH WAX,WEWE UHM BUILD OUR BOATS OUT OF A LITTLE PAPER CUPS WITH WAX
4578,WELL WE USED PENNIES AS PASSENGERS AND THE SIZE WAS IMPORTANT SO THAT WE COULD SEE HOW MANY PASSENGERS IT COULD HOLD,WELL WE USED PENIES AS PASENGERS AND THE SIZE WAS IMPORTANT SO THAT WE COULD SEE HOW MEY PACKESENGERS IT COULD HOLD
4579,SEE YA,CA
4580,YOU TOO,TO
4581,UM WE WOULD PUT THE PENNIES IN CAREFULLY AND KEEP IT BALANCED ON ALL SIDES SO THAT IT DIDN'T SINK AS QUICKLY,UHM WE WOULD PUT THE PENIES IN CAREFULLY AND KEEP IT BALLONCED ON AL SIDES TOGH THAT IT DIDN'T SINK AT QUICKLY
4582,THANK YOU,THANK YOU
4583,THEY'RE DESIGNED TO FLOAT AND HOLD PEOPLE,THEYR DESINED TO FLUTE AND HOLD PEOPLE
4584,IT SH THEY EACH SHOW UM HOW MANY MILLILITERS OF WATER THEY EACH HOLD,HICH THEY EACH SHOW UHM HOW MANY MILL LEADORS OF WHATEER THEY EASH HOLD
4585,EACH ARE DIFFERENT HEIGHT AND UM THEY EACH SINK UH LOWER AND HIGHER IN TO THE WATER DEPENDING ON HOW TALL THEY ARE,EACH ARE A DIFERENT HIGHT AND UHM THEY EACH SINK U THE LOWER AND HIGER INTO THE WATER DEPENDING  ON HOWCH HILL THEY ARE
4586,THEY MIGHT HAVE BEEN UM DIFFERENT CUPS AND THEY MIGHT NOT HAVE BEEN EQUALLY UM MADE AND UH CUT LEVELLY,THEY MIGHT HVE BEEN UHM DIFERENT CUPS AND THEY MIGHT NOT HAVE BEEN EQUALLY UHM MADE AND U CUT LEVELY
4587,UM IT WAS UH LIKE IT WAS ACTUALLY THE WATER THAT WE UM TOOK OUT OF THE THINGS AND THEN PUT THEM IN THIS CONTAINER THAT SHOWED MILLILITERS AND THAT'S HOW WE GOT OUR RESULTS,UHMIT WAS U LIKE IT WAS ACTUALLY THE WATER THAT WE UHM TOOK OUT OF THE THINGS AND THEN PUT THEM IN THIS CONTAINER THAT SHOULD MILL LEADERS AND THAT'S HOW WE GOT OUR RESULTS
4588,UM I WAS AMAZED TO SEE THAT WHEN WE PUT THE PASSENGERS IN UM UM JUST A LITTLE CUP OF YOU PUT A CIRCLE AROUND IT AND EVEN THE BALANCE THEN IT MAY IT YOU COULD GET A LOT OF PASSENGERS IN THERE,MI WAS AMAE TO SEE THAT WHEN WE PUT THE PASSENGERS IN UHM U JUST A LTTLE CUP IF YOU PUT A CIRCLE AROUND IT AND EVEN THE BLONCE THEN IT MAIT YOU COULD GET A LOT OF PASENGERS IN THERE
4589,WE MADE TWO BOATS THAT WERE THREE CENTIMETERS LONG,WEMADE TWOO BOATS THAT WERE THREE SENT METERS LONG
4590,BY UM DOING THEM UM CORRECTLY AND ORDERLY AND UH SLOWLY SO THAT YOU CAN GET UH ACCURATE DATA,BY UHM DOING THEM U CRRECTLY AND ORDERLY AND U SLOWLY SO THAT YOUCAN GET A ACURIT DATA
4591,UM I HAD ANOTHER DAY IN SCIENCE AND UH WE WORKED ON BOATS AND UM WE UH HAD VARIABLES AND OTHER LIKE THINGS AND IT WAS IN LIKE A LITTLE TUB,UM I HAD ANOTHER DAY IN SCIENCE AND WALL WE WORKED ON BOATS AND UHM WE U HAD VERYABLES AND OTHER LIKE THINGS AND IT WAS IN EYLIKE A LITTLE TUB
4592,WELL WHEN WE MEASURED THEM WE MADE SURE THAT THEY WERE EACH UH DIFFERENT UM HEIGHT AND YEAH,WELL WHEN WE MEASURE THEM WE MAD SURE THAT THEY WERE EACH A DIFERENT UHM HEIGHT AND YE
4593,GOOD,GOOD
4594,YOU COULD MAY BE ADD MORE PENNIES OR TAKE AWAY THE PENNY AND ADD SOMETHING UM DIFFERENT LIKE A DIFFERENT OBJECT TO IT,YOU COULD MAYBE ADMORE PENIES OR TAKE AWAY THE PENY AND ADD SOMETHING UHM DIFFERENT LIKE A DIFERENT OBJECT TO IT
4595,YOU HAVE TO PICK IT UP AND THEN LET IT SWING AND WHEN IT GOES BACK AND FORTH AND LIKE,YOU HAVE TO PICK IT UP AND THEN LET IT SWING AND WHEN IT GOS BACK AND FORTH AND LAKE
4596,THAT WITH THE HIGHER SWINGS UM THE UM IN FIFTEEN SECONDS IT DID UM IT HAD MORE CYCLES,THAT WAD THE HIGHER SWINGS UHM THE UHM IN FIFTEEN SECONDS IT DID UHM IT HAD MORE S CICLS
4597,WHEN YOU PUT IT AT THE TOP IT STARTS BUT GRADUALLY IT'LL START TO UM DECREASE UM IN HOW HIGH IT GOES CAUSE THERE'S NOT ENOUGH FORCE AND THE WEIGHT IS WEIGHING IT DOWN,WHEN YOU PUNTING OUT THE TOP IT STARTS BUT GRADUALLY IT'LL START TO UHM DEECREACE UHM AND HOW HIGH IT GOESE CAUSE THERE'S NOT ENOUGH FORCE AND THE WAYT IS WEAING IT DOWN
4598,WELL WHEN IT SWINGS BACK AND FORTH THE WEIGHT WOULD CAUSE IT TO SINK LOWER AND NOT GO AS HIGH WHEN IT COMES BACK AROUND AND COMPLETES THE CYCLE,WELL WHEN IT SWINGS BACK AND FORTH THE WEITE WOULD CAUSE IT TO SINK LOWER AND NOT GO AS HIGH WHEN IT COMES BACK AROUND AND COMPLEAT THE CICLES
4599,IT MEANS THAT IT'S A CERTAIN THING IN AN EXPERIMENT THAT YOU COULD CHANGE OR KEEP THE SAME AND IT'S PART OF THE EXPERIMENT,IT MEANS THAT IT'S A CERTIN THING IND AN EXPEREMENT THAT YOU CAUN CHANGE OR KEEP THE SAME IN IT'S PART OF THE EXPEREMENT
4600,WELL THERE IS MORE UM THERE IS ONE ON ONE AND THEN LIKE IT GOES IN THE NUMBER OF HOW MANY THERE ARE AND I THINK WELL WELL OF COURSE IT WILL IT WOULD CAUSE MORE WEIGHT,WELL THERE 'S MORE HM THERE'S ONE ON ONE AND THEN LIKE IT GOES IN THE NUMBER OF HOW MANY THERE ARE  END I THINK THA WELL OF COURSE IT WAS IT WOULD CAUSE MORE WEEK
4601,WHEN I CLICK THE BOB GOES TO WHERE I CLICKED,WHEN I CLICK THE BOB GOES TO WEAR I CLICKED
4602,WHAT'S THE TABLE FOR,WHAT'S THE TABLE PIRF COLEGING
4603,THE CYCLE IS WHEN IT GOES BACK AND BACK AND THEN BACK AGAIN TO WHERE IT USED TO BE,THE SIYCHOL IS HONE IT GOES BACK AND BACK AND THEN BACK AGAIN TO WERE IT USED TO BEE
4604,YES,S
4605,YES,YES
4606,UH AT THE END OF THE STRING THERE IS ITS WEIGHT AND IT WILL KEEP THE STRING MOVING,UH AT THE END OF THE STRING THERE IS ITS WHAITE AND IT WILL KEEP THE STRING MOVING
4607,WELL SINCE IT'S AT THE END OF THE STRING IT WILL CAUSE THE STRING NOT TO GO FLIMSY AND AROUND,WELL SENSE IS AT THE END OF THE STRING IT WILL CALLS THE STRING NOT TO GO FLIMYING AROUND
4608,IT GOES DOWN AND UP AND THEN DOWN AND UP AGAIN TO UH THE PLACE WHERE IT WAS BUT IT'S STILL LOWER THAN,IT GOES DOWN AND UP AND THEN DOWN AND UP AGAIAND TO  THE PLACE WHERE IT WAS BUT IT'S STILL LOWERER THEN
4609,I MAY PUT UM SOMETHING THAT'S NOT A PENNY AND MAY BE IT WOULD CAUSE MORE WEIGHT,I MAYGHT PUT UHM SOMETHING THAT'S NOT A PENY AND MAYBE IT WOULD CAUSE MORE WAITE
4610,MAY BE IF YOU UM HAD A BIGGER PENCIL TO HANG IT FROM THEN UM IT MIGHT UH AFFECT MAY BE HOW HIGH IT GOES,MAYBE IF YOU UHM HAD A BIGER PENCIL TO HANGING IT FROM THEN UHM IT MIGHT E EFFECT MAY BE HOW HIGH IT GOES
4611,WHEN I DID IT TWO TIMES UH I REALIZED THAT THE CYCLES WERE THE SAME BOTH TIMES,WHEN I DID IT TWO TIMES UH I REALIZED THAT THE SCICLES WERE THE SAME BOTH TIMES
4612,YOU CAN SEE HOW MANY TIMES IT WILL S MAKE A CYCLE UM IN FIFTEEN SECONDS,YOU CAN SEE HOW MANY TIMES IT WILL US MAKE A SIGKOWIL U IFIFTEEN SECONDS
4613,YOU CAN COLLECT IT ON A DATA FILE,YOU CAN COLLECTIT ON A DAY TO FIRLE
4614,THAT WOULD DEPEND ON WHAT KIND OF VARIABLES THEY WERE AND WHAT THEY WERE CHANGING,THAT WOULD DEPEND ON WHAT KIND OF VERYABLES THEY WERE IN WHAT THEY WERE CHANGING
4615,THE LONGER THE UM PENDULUM THE SHORTER AMOUNT OF STRINGS THAT UH I MEAN THE SHORTER AMOUNT OF CYCLES THAT IT HAS,THE LONGER THE UHM PENGILUM THE SHORTER AMOUNT OF STRINGS THAT UH I MEAN THA SORT OF AMOUNT OF SIECLES THAT IT HAS
4616,UM WELL UM I WELL I DON'T REALLY KNOW,UHM WELL MI WELL I DON'TN'T REALLY KNOW
4617,AT THE X AXIS UM THERE'S NOTHING,AT THE EXAXIS U TERE'S NOTHING
4618,UM THE THINGS THAT UH HAS BEEN CHANGED IS THE LENGTH OF THE STRING UM WHICH THEY SWANG,UHM THE THINGS THAABUT AS BEING CHANGED IS THE LENGTH OF THE STRING UHM WHICH THEY SWING
4619,THAT UM THE MORE THE CENTIMETERS THE LESS THE CYCLES SO IT GOES FROM ONE TWENTY TO FIFTEEN AND IT GOES FROM SEVEN TO TWENTY,THAT UHM THE MORE THE SENTEMETERS THE LESST I SICLE SO IT GOES FROM ONE TWENTY TO FIFTEEN AND IT GOES FROM SEVEN TO TWENTY
4620,BYE,BY
4621,YES BECAUSE UM BECAUSE THEY ONLY CHANGED ONE VARIABLE FROM THE LONGER UH STRING,YESE BECAUSE UHM BECAUSE THEY ONLY CHANGED ONE VERYABLE FROM THE LONGER A STRING
4622,WELL WE UM DIDN'T CHANGE THE TIME BECAUSE WE KNEW FOR CERTAIN THAT THERE WOULD MORE UM SWINGS IF WE CHANGED THE TIME,WELL WE UHM DIDN'T CHANGE THE TIME BECAUSE WE KNEW FOR CERTEON THAT THERE WOULD BE MORE UHM SWINGS IF WE CHANGED THE TIME
4623,I FOUND OUT THAT THE SHORTER THE STRING THE UM THE LESS UH CYCLES IT HAS,I FOUND OUT THAT THE SHORT OF THE STRING THE LESS U CICL S IT HAS
4624,I MEAN THE MORE CYCLES THAT IT HAS,I MEAN THE MOR O ER CICLE THAT IT HAS
4625,UM IT'S A PENDULUM WITH A BOB AT THE END AND IT'S ON A HIGH POINT UM AND IT'S HANGING FROM A PENCIL,UHM IT'S A PENDILEM WITH A BOB AT THE END AND IT'S ON IT HIGH POINT UM AND IT'S HANGING FROM A AK PENCIL
4626,IT HAS CERTAIN FIXTURES AND UM IT DOESN'T CHANG IT DOESN'T CHANGE MUCH,IT HAS SERTEN FIXTURES AND UHM IT DOESN'T CHA IT DOESN'T CHANGE MUCH
4627,UM ON THE Y AXIS,UHM ON THE WIDEAXES
4628,I MEAN THINGS THAT WE CHANGED IN UM DIFFERENT SERIES OF THE EXPERIMENT,I MEAN THINGS THAT WE CHANGED IN U DIFERENT SERIES OF THE EXPEREMENT
4629,THEY ARE UM HOW MANY CYCLES AND THE LENGTH,THEY ARE UHM A HOW MANY SCICLES AND THE LENGTH
4630,PRETTY GOOD,PRETTY GOOD
4631,I FOUND THE LENGTH OF HOW UM LONG THE STRINGS WERE AND OF HOW MANY CYCLES THEY HAD,I FOUND THE LENGTH OF HALL UHM AMONG THE STRINGS WERE AND OF HOW MANY CICLES THEY HAD
4632,UH I IN SCIENCE TODAY I LEARNED THAT WHEN YOU TRIED THE RELEASE POSITION IT DOESN'T CHANGE THE LENGTH OF HOW MANY CYCLES IT DID,U  IN SCIENCE TODAY I LEARNED THAT WHEN YOU TRY THE RELEASE POSITION IT DOESN'T CHANGE THE LENGTH OF HOW MANY CICLES IT DID
4633,WELL TODAY WE LEARNED HOW TO UM UH WE WELL WE WORKED ON PENDULUMS AGAIN AND WE UH SHOWED THEM AT DIFFERENT ANGLES AND WE CHANGED UM SOME VARIABLES,WELL TODAY WE LEARNED HOW TO UHM UH WELL WELL WE WORKED ON PENGLUMS AGAIN AND WE U SHOWEDTHEM AT DIFERENT ANGLES AND WE CHANGED UM SOME VERYBBLES
4634,UM SO THAT THINGS DON'T GET OUT OF CONTROL AND YOU DON'T HAVE TOO MANY UM THINGS THAT ARE NOT ALIKE,UUHM S THAT THINGS DON'T GET OUT OF IT CONTROLL AND YOU DON'T HAVE TOO MANY UHM THININGS THAT ARE NOT  LIKE
4635,WHEN IT WENT UM DOWN AND WENT BACK UP AGAIN IT WENT AT A SLIGHTLY LOWER UH PLACE,WHEN IT WENT UHM DOWN AND WENT BACK UP AGAIN IT WENT AT A SLIGHTLY LER A PLACE
4636,WE WERE TRYING TO FIND OUT HOW THE PENDULUMS WORKED AND UH WHAT MADE THEM DIFFERENT AND WHAT MADE THEM THE SAME,WE WERE TRYING TO FIND OUT HOW THE PENDILEMS WORKED AND OF WHAT MADE THEM DIFFERENT AN WHAT MADE THEM THE SAME
4637,IT DOESN'T MATTER UH HOW MUCH WEIGHT THERE IS UM IT JUST MATTERS HOW LONG THE STRING IS,IT DOESN'T MATTER UH HOW MUCH WAITE THERE IS UHM IT JUST MATERS HOW LONG THE STRING IS
4638,IT SHOWS ON THE TOP UH HOW MANY CYCLES IT HAD UM ON THE SIDE IT SHOWS HOW LONG THE STRINGS WAS,IT SHOWS O THE TOP OF HOW MANY CICLES IT HAD AND UM ON THE SIDE IT SHOWS HOW LONG THE STRINGHST WAS
4639,I WOULD PUT IT UM AFTER LIKE AFTER THE NAME OF THE BOAT AND I WOULD PUT IT THERE AFTER IN UNDER THE UH SIGN THAT SAYS CAPACITY AND TELL HOW MANY MILLILITERS,I WOULD PUT IT UHM AFTER LIKE AFTERR THE NAME OF THE BOAT AND I WOULD PUT IT THERE AFTERI UNDER THE A SIGN THAT SAID COPASITY AND TELL HOW MANY MELLOW LEADERS
4640,M YOU CAN FIGURE OUT HOW MANY PENNIES CAN GO IN TO IT AND HOW MUCH WATER IT CAN HOLD,YOU CAN FIGURE OUT HOW MANY PENIES CAN GO INTO IT AND M HOW MUCH WATER IT CAN HOLD
4641,UM WE DECIDED UM TO KEEP THE KIND OF CUP THE IT WAS AND THE CONSTRUCTION OF THE CUP AND HOW IT WAS CUT NOT THE LENGTH BUT YEAH UM WE ALSO DECIDED HOW MUCH WATER WE HAD IN THE TUB TO KEEP THE SAME AND YEAH,UHM WE DECIDED TO KEEP U  THE  CONDITION OF THE SEA UHM
4642,WELL WE MADE FOUR DIFFERENT SIZES SO THAT WE COULD SEE HOW MANY PENNIES EACH COULD HOLD AND THE AMOUNT OF WATER THEY COULD EACH HOLD,EL WE MADE FOUR DIFERENT SIZEESS SO THAT WE COULD SEE HOWMANY PENIES EACH GOD OLD AND THE A MOUNT OF WATER THEY COULD EACHOLD
4643,THEY STAY THE SAME AND UM UH DON'T MAKE THE EXPERIMENT TOO DIFFERENT THAN IT MIGHT HAVE U MIGHT HAVE BEEN OR USED TO BE,THEY STAY THE SAME AND UHM U DON' WON'T MAKE THE EXPEREMENT TO DIFERENT THAN IT MIGHT HAVE YOU MIGHT HAVE BEEN OR USED TO BE
4644,OH I WOULD PUT IT ON THE BOTTOM,I WILL PUT IT ON THE BOTTOM
4645,AND ALSO SETTING UP A DATA CHART,AND ALSO SETTING UP A DEET SHART
4646,THE CAPACITY GOES ON THE BOTTOM AND UH THE NUMBER OF PASSENGERS GOES ON THE SIDE,THE COPASITY GOES ON THE BOTOM AND O THE NUMBER O PASENGERS GOES ON THE SIDE
4647,WE USED THE SYRINGE TO UM UH TAKE THE WATER OUT AND UH PUT THEM IN A LITTLE CONTAINER THAT MEASURED IN MILLILITERS UH TO SEE HOW MANY MILLILITERS EACH CUP COULD HOLD,YO USED THE SARANGE TO U TAKE THE WATER OUT AND THEN PUT THEM IN A LITTLE CONTAINER THAT MEASURED MELO LEADERS UH TO SEEE HOW MANY MILOLEATERS EACH CUP COULD HOLD
4648,UH I FORGOT WHAT A STANDARD PROCEDURE IS,U I FORGOT WHAT A STANGERD PECEGER IS
4649,IT DOESN'T UM CAUSE THE BOAT TO SINK AND THEN POP UP AGAIN CAUSE WHEN IT DOES THAT THEN THE WATER MIGHT SPLASH IN TO IT AND CAUSE IT TO SINK FASTER,IT DOESN'T UHM CAUSE THE BOAT TO SINK AND THEN POP UP AGAIN CAUSS WHEN IT DOES THAT THEN THE WATER MIGHT SPLASH INTO IT AND CAUSE IT TO SINK FASTER
4650,WE UH USED DIFFERENT UH HEIGHTS IN THE CUPS AND BUT WE KEPT EVERYTHING ELSE THE SAME AND WE ONLY CHANGED ONE VARIABLE WHICH MADE IT A CONTROLLED EXPERIMENT,WE A US DIFFERENT A HIGHTS IN THE CUPS AND BUT WE KEPT EVERYTHINGA ELSE THE SAME AND WE ONLY CHASGED ONE VER ABLE WHICH MADE IT A CONTROLD EXPEREMENT
4651,UM THE VARIABLE THAT'S BEING CHANGED IS THE HEIGHT OF THE CUPS AND YEAH,UHM THE VERYBLE THAT'S BEING CHANGED IS THE HEIGHT OF THE CUPS AND YEAH
4652,WE HAD TO THINK ABOUT HOW WE WERE GOING TO PUT THEM IN AND UH WE HAD TO PREDICT HOW MANY WOULD FIT IN THERE BEFORE IT'S SUNK,E HAD TO THINK ABOUT HOW WE WERE GOING TO PUT THEM IN AND UH WE HAD TO PERDICK TO HEOW MANY W WOULD FIT IN THERE BEFORE IT SUNK

5394,IT GOES TOWARD WITH THE SIDE OF THE LIGHT BULB AND IT GOES UP TO THE FILAMENT AND IT GOES DOWN IT GOES KEEP GOING FORWARD THEN IT GOES TO THE POSITIVE SIDE,IT GOES TOLD THE SIDE OF THE VIGHPBOD AND IT GOES UP TO THE FILLMENT AND IT GOES THERE IT GOES UHM TA IT GOES KEEP GOIN FOLD AND IT THEN IT GOES TO THE POSITIVE SIDE
5395,IT'S THE SOURCE THAT GIVES US THE LIGHT BULB ENERGY,IT'S TE SOURCE THAT GIVES THE UHM MAY PUL BENAG
5396,ENERGY,ENARGY
5397,BOTH OF THE WIRE THOSE ONE WIRE GOING FROM THE BOTTOM AND THOSE ONE WIRE GOING FROM THE SIDE,BOT BOTH OF THE WI THEES ONE WHILR GOINGS FROM THE BOTTOM AND TWEAS ONE WHILRE GOING FROM THE SIDE
5398,HOW DO MAKE A LIGHT BULB LIGHT,HOW DO MAKE A LIBL BL
5399,THE BATTERY TURNED AND NOW ITS GOING THE OPPOSITE WAY AND LIKE ITS GOING INTO DIFFERENT DIRECTION ALL IN THOUGH THE LIGHT BULB IS STILL LIGHTING,THE BADE TURNED AND NOW IT'S GOING THE OPPOSITE WAY AND AND LIKE IT'S GOING IN A D DIFERENT DIRECTION NOW AND THE THE LIHPAL WAS STILL LIGHTING
5400,GOOD,GOOD
5401,THE D CELL IS GIVING THE LIGHT BULB ENERGY THROUGH THE WIRES,THE DCAS GIVING THE THE ALIBLE B UHM AN AG THOUGH THE WILES
5402,THE LIGHT BULB NOW LEAD UP WANT TO CHANGES TO THE SIDE,THE IOLB NOW LID UP WHEN I CHANGED IT TO THE SIDE
5403,IT MEANS THAT IT WILL RECIEVES BUT IT WILL RECIEVES THE ENERGY FROM THE D CELL,IT MEANS THAT IT WRE SEIVES THE AA IT WESAVES THE ENARGY FROM THE DECA
5404,OKAY,OKA
5405,IT MOVES THE OPPOSITE WAY,IT MOVES THE OPOSITE WAY
5406,YUP,YOOK
5407,ITS FLOWING ALL IN ONE DIRECTION TO THE LIGHT BECAUSE THE POSITIVE SIDE IS GOING THROUGH THE BATTERY INTO THE NEGATIVE SIDE,IT'S FLOAWING ALL IN ONE DIRECTION TO THELIGHT BECAUSE BECAUSE THE THE UHM PS THE POSITIVE SIDE IS GOING LUG THE BADLY INTO THE NEGETIVE SIZE
5408,IT'S TO THE LEFT AND LIKE CENTER TO THE LEFT AND SO IT CONNECTED TO THE METAL POLE IT WON'T THE MOTOR WON'T MOVE SO THAT MEANS THE SWITCH IS MAKING IT OFF,IT'S IT'S TO THE LEFT AND UHM LIKE SENC IT'S TO THE LEFT AND ITS NAT CONECTED TO THE MEDLE POLE IT WON'T THE MOTLE WON'T MOVE SO THAT MEANS THE SWISH IS MAKING IT OF
5409,THE MOTOR IS MOVING,THE MOTLE WAS MOVING
5410,THE SOLAR PANEL WAS GIVING IT ELECTRICITY TO D CELL CAN MOVE,THE SOL PANALS UHM GIVING IT ALITTUSTY SO IT CAN MOVE
5411,ITS SUNNY ALL IN THE SOLAR PANEL IS GIVING THE ELECTRICTY TO THE MOTOR,IT'S SUNYOW AND THE SOLE PANAL IS GIVING TRIITY TO THE MUTLE
5412,IT DOESN'T MOVE,IT DOESN'T MOVE
5413,IT DOESN'T GIVE ELECTRICITY TO GET IT DOESN'T GIVE ELECTRICITY,IT DOESN'T GIVE IT A LECTRISITY TO GIV TO IT DOESN'T GIVE IT A LECTRISTY
5414,THE MOTOR STARTS MOVING,THE MUTLE STARTS MOVING
5415,THAT IS THAT ITS OFF I THINK IT MEANS THAT IS OFF,THAT IT'S U THAT THE DE IT THAT'S IT'S OF I THINK IT MEANS THAT IT'S OF
5416,MAKES THE MOTOR MOVE,MAKES THE MOUTLE MOVE
5417,THE MOTOR STARTS RUNNING,THE MUTLE START'S RUNING
5418,NO I DO NOT,NO I DO NOT
5419,THEY THE SUN COME IF THE SUN IS SHINING ON THEM IT GIVES THE ELECTRICITY TO ALL THOSE THINGS,THEY UHM THE SUN COME IF THE SUN ISHINING ON IT IT GIVES A LETTOUR STADY TOL OTHER THINGS
5420,WE HAVE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT MOTORS AND WIRES AND WHEN THEY CONNECT THE MOTOR MOVES AND WE THINK,WE'VE BEEN WLEURNING LEARNING ABOUT MUDDLES AND WHILES AND WHEN THEY CONNECT THE MUTLE MOVES AND EVERYTHING
5421,NOW THE ELECTRICITY GOES INTO THE MOTOR BECAUSE IT'S NOT TRAVELLING THROUGH THE METAL AND IT IS MAKE THE MOTOR RUN,NOGETRISITY GOES INTO THE MODLE BECAUSE NOT TRAVELING TROGH THE MIDDLE AND IT DESN'T MAKE THE MUDE ON
5422,IT GIVES THE SOLAR PANEL ELECTRICITY TO GIVE IT TO THE MOTOR SO IT MOVES SO THE MOTOR RUNS AND MOVES,IT GIVES A SOLE PANDALS A LICTASTITY TO GIVE IT TO THE MUTLE SO IT MOVES SO THE MULE UNS AND MOVES
5423,THE MOTOR IS WORKING,THE MOTOLES WALKING
5424,BYE MORNIE,DIMONEY
5425,OPEN,OPEN
5426,THE FLAG IS MOVING AND ITS IMPORTANT BECAUSE THAT MEANS THE MOTOR IS WORKING AND ITS MOVING,THE FLAG IS MOVHING AND IT'S IMPORTANT BECAUSE THAT MEANS THE MOUTLE IS WALKING IN ITS MOTHING
5427,THE SWITCH NEEDS TO BE CLOSED,THE SWISH NEEDS TO BE CLOSHED
5428,THOSE TWO WIRES CONNECTED TO THE PART EVEN NEGATIVE SIDE OF THE D CELL AND ITS MAKING THE MOTOR MOVES,THER WAS TWO WHIDERS CONECTED TO TE POLITIVE N NEGETIVE SIDE OF THE DEECIL AND SMAKING THE MOTL MOVE
5429,THAT IT TURNS TO THE SUN SHINE UNTILL THAT JUST BEING GIVES THE ELECTRICITY TO ALL THOSE THINGS,THAT IT TORNS THAT THE SUN SHINE UNTI LETRISITY AND GIVES THE LECTHRISITY TO OTHER THINGS
5430,I WILL NO ELECTRICITY WOULD COME THROUGH IT BECAUSE AT THERE WAS NO SUN ON IT MAKE A INTERVAL ELECTRICITY,IT W NOLACOR CITY WOULD COME THROUGH IT BECAUSE IT DOEWS NO SUN ON IT TO MAKE IT INTO A LECTRISITY
5431,ITS IN THE CLOSE POSITION,IT'S IN THE CLOSE POSITION
5432,THOSE ARE ELECTRICITY GOING INTO IT,THERE WAS A LETA CITY GOING INTO IT
5433,THE TRACK GIVING THE ELECTRICITY TO MOVE,IT'S NOT GIVING IT LAC TC A  LECTRICITY TO MOVE
5434,SO THAT ENDED THE POSITIVE SIDE OF THE D CELL THAT WHILE IS GOING THROUGH THE METAL CONNECTING TO THE OTHER SIDE OF THE WIRE IS GOING TO THE MOTOR AND THAT'S GIVING THE POWER,SO THAT AND THE POSITIVE SIDE THE DEATE THAT WHILE IS GOING THROUGH THE MEDLE CONECTING TO THE OTHER SIDE OF THE WILEAN'S GOING TO THE MUDLE AND THAT'S GIVING A POWEL
5435,THE MOTOR STARTS MOVING,THE MUTLE STARTS MOVING
5436,IT SHOWING THAT THE D CELL IS GIVING THE MOTOR ELECTRICITY SO THE MOTOR MOVES,IT'S SHOWING THAT THE DEECELL IS GIVING THE MOUTLE LETRICITY SO THE MOTLE MOVES
5437,THE MOTOR STARTS MOVING,THE MOUTLE STARTS MOVING
5438,THE SOLAR PANEL HAS TO GET SUNSHINE,THE SHOLE PANAL HAS TO GET SUNSHINE
5439,MAGNET,ORID
5440,THE SWITCH HAS TO BE ON,THE SWISH HAE TOA ARE
5441,THE FLAG MOVES,THE FLAG VIEWEWS
5442,WELL IF SUN IS SHARING THE CELL THEN ITS WORKING BUT WHEN IT GOES OFF THERE IS NO WORK AND THE FLAG WILL,WHEN THE UN IS HETING THE SS NAT ITS WOARKY BUT WHEN IT GOS A THAT IT WILL WORK AND THE FLIME WORK
5443,THE ELECTRICITY WILL GO THROUGH THE D CELL AND IT WILL TURN ON THE FLAG,THE ELECTRICITY WON'T GOTHR THE DEACAIL AND IT WILL'T TRUNL THE FLAG
5444,THE D CELLS ELECTRICITY MAKES THE FLAG MOVE,PRODUCE ETRCITTY MAKES EAR FLAZOM
5445,THE ELECTRICITY GOES THROUGH THE WIRES AND UNTIL IT'S CELL AND THEN IT GOES INTERACT WHEN WILL CONTRACTION AND THEN IT MAKES THE FLAG MOVE,E L JUS I HE GOS THROUGH THE WIRES AND IN TO L HE SE  AND THEN IT GOES INTO THAT LITTLE C CHO COD AN THEN AN MAKES THE FLATY OR
5446,IT MAKES THE FLAG MOVE,IT MAKES THE FLAG MOO
5447,NO NAIL,O NO A
5448,AND ELECTRICITY GO THROUGH THE TWO WIRES TO MAKE A FLAG MOVE BECAUSE THE FLAG IS METAL ON BOTH SIDES SO THE METAL TOUCHES THAT IT TURNS ON MAKE THROUGH ELECTRICITY,Y AN YOELES S HY WANT E TA TTHE WIRE SO THEY DON'T L LIE BECAUSE THE FLAT ISN'T AT AL ON BOTH SIDES SO A META TUCHES IT IT TURS ATER A TO THE P
5449,THE CELL HAS BEHIND THE SUN AND THEN THE WIRES CONNECT ALL THE WAY TO THE CONTRACTION AND THEN MAKE REFLECTIVE SO ELECTRICITY GOES THROUGH THE FEW THING OVER AND OVER AND OVER,THE SELL HAS TO BE HAING THA SUN AND THEN THE WAIRES AND THI GO ALL THE WAY TO BAC ONTRATION AND THENT MAKE THA FLAT MOVE SO ELCTRIS GORS OR THE IL THING ER AND OVER AND OVER
5450,IT'S ON THE METAL WHERE THE WIRE IS SO IT DOESN'T COUNT ALL THE WAY BUT IT GOES ON LIKE SO THERE JUST IT IS ELECTRICITY PASS THERE SO THEY WAS ON TOP WHAT A PRETTY AS MUCH ELECTRICITY,IT'S ON THE MEDDLE WHERE  THE WITER IS SO IT DOESN'T CO ALL THE WAY BUT IT GOS ON LIKE COWLAY SO  JUS TE LITRCITY FASTER SO IF IT WAS ON TOP WOD AR DO YOU SAW A CALIN TRISI
5451,THE ELECTRICITY GOING THROUGH,THAT YOU OS LIS GON THROUGH
5452,BECAUSE THEY DIDN'T THEN IT WHAT IF WORK AS WELL AS A IT'S DOWN SO WHILE WE ITS DARK ANYTHING OUTSIDE WILL NOT WORK,BECAUSE IF IT DIDN'T THEN IT WOULDN'T WORK INS WELLAS IT IS NOW SO HA IT'S DARK AND IT'S OUTSIDE WI NOT WORK
5453,IT'S NOT GOING TO TILL BECAUSE THE SWITCHES OFF AND IT'S NOT CREATING A CIRCUIT TO MAKE THE FLAG MOVE,IT DO NOT GOT TA GO THE IT W BECAUSE THE SWICH IS OF AND IT'S NOT OR THE SCIRCUT TO MAKE THE LATERING
5454,NO,THAT  YO REALLY A
5455,IT'S NOT TOUCHING METAL SO WHERE ELECTRICITY WON'T GO TO THE FLAG AND IT WILL MAKE A CIRCUIT,IT'S NOT TUCHINUR MEDDAL SO WHEN UTRISITY WI GO TO THE FLAGS AND IT WILL MAKE A SIRC
5456,BECAUSE THE D CELL HAS ELECTRICITY IN IT SO WHEN THEN TWO CONNECTERS CONNECT TO THE METAL FIND ON BOTH SIDES AS THE SWITCH TOUCHES METAL THEN IT WILL START WORKING AND CREATE AND PUT IT WOULD ELECTRICITY TO THE FLAG,CAUSE THE DE SA HAS E LECTTRISCITY IN IT SO I THET TWO CONECTERS CONECT TO THE MEDAL FLAG ON BOTH SIDES AND THE SWICH TOUCH HIS MEDLE AN HE ILL START WORKIN  CR AND   SEAL JUST I TO THE FLAG
5457,THE D CELL IS AT A CIRCUIT,THE DESE ISIN'T A SCURI THE ISHI
5458,THOSE ARE ALSO THAT ELECTRICITY SO WHEN YOU PUT TWO WIRES ON THEY AND PUT A SET TO A D CELL AND PUTTING INTO SUN THEN VIBRATING TO BE LIKE THAT ELECTRICITY GOING THROUGH THAT CELL,A THOSE AR ALSO NO YO TRU  DO SO HAN HO PA TWO ARS O DI A FRTIS A TWENTY SO AND PUT IT IN THE SUNAN I BREING A TAI A  IS A THATS EAL JUST IN ONE THROU THAT SA
5459,IT HAS TO BE ON THE METAL,IT HAS TO BE ON THE MEDDAL
5460,WE'VE HAS BEEN CREATING CIRCUIT,LEAVE AREATING S ET
5461,THEN IT DOESN'T WORK,THEN IT DI LE OR
5462,THAT WHEN I TOUCH IT IT MOVES AND THEN I TOUCH IT AGAIN IT MOVES OFF THE CIRCUIT SO IT WILL PRODUCE THE ELECTRICITY BUT WON'T DOES TOUCH THE METAL AND PRODUCES ELECTRICITY,THAT WHEN I TUTCH IT IT MOVES ONLY WHAN I TOUCH IT AGAIN IT MOVES OFI THE SURCIN SO IT WILL PRODYOU  A TU SEE DOES TUTCH THE MIDDLE IT PRETY S CIRY
5463,BECAUSE WHEN THE WIRE FIX THE D CELL AND OTHER ELECTRICITY DOESN'T LIKE CONTRACTED LIKE THEY CONTRACTED TOO,CAUSE WHE WOR THEWIR IT'S LADYSL  I DON LIKE TUR CITYY AUS THA GOJUIN MADE  THA CHCHIP WOR
5464,THE FLAG MOVES,STHE FLAG MOVES
5465,IT WOULDN'T WORK BECAUSE THAT'S BE SEMI AND MIKE HAS BEEN GETTING IT,IT WHOT A GR CAUSE IT HAS T BE SUNNY AND WHITE HAS TE HETY
5466,ELECTRICITY IS GOING THROUGH IT TO MAKE IT MOVE,O  TUS'S GOING THOIT TO I GET LEAER
5467,THE D CELL AND THE ELECTRICITY,THE DECO ELI LTERE SI
5468,THE D CELL HAS TO BE ATTRACTED TWO WIRES TO GO THROUGH THE ELECTRICITY TO GET TO THE MOVE,I STILL HAS TO BE TOWIS TO GO TO GO WITH WHERE HE LIKE TRCITY TO GET TO
5469,THE FLAG STOPS MOVING BECAUSE IT DOES THE SUNLIGHT AND IT IS HAVE ELECTRICITY BETWEEN THE WIRES,THE FLAG STOPS OM THE BING BECAUSE IT  IT DOES A HEAV LI AND IT IS A HEAVY LO TO SING BETWEE N  A BA
5470,NO METAL IS PUT TOUCHING THOSE TWO WIRES AND LIKE THAT AND CONNECT STILL JUST READY TO GET THE,OH MEDDLE LES'TCH R TO THE IR SO IT ISAND CAUSE HAIT WAS I JUST NIG TO GET OA LOT F TE BY
5471,I TALK TO YOU LATER BYE,ILL TALK TO YOUR LATER BY
5472,YOU'RE SEPARATE NO AND THERE ITS IT'S LIKE WE BETTER SO YEAH,YUSTOUL PUT AN NAIL THAN THERE IT'S IT'S LIKE WAY BETTER SO YEA
5473,I DON'T KNOW,I DON'T KNOW
5474,ITS FLOWING THROUGH ELECTRICITY,CHIT'S FLOWING THR ELECTRICITY
5475,ELECTRICITY IS GOING THROUGH IT OKAY,HE LOOKS YO CITY AS GOING THO IT OK
5476,AND FINNALY MET BEFORE,I'M FINEDL WE'VE MET BEFORE
5477,WE'VE BEEN LEARNING SCIENCE YOU CAN TALKING TO ME ABOUT IT,WE'VE BEN LEARNING SCIENCE EVER SINCE YOU BEEN TALKING TO ME ABOUT IT
5478,YOUR DOWN,YOU'RE DON'
5479,BECAUSE THERE NOT METAL LIKE ALL THE OTHER ONCE,CAUSE THEY'RE NOT MEDDLE LIKE ALL THE OTHER ONES
5480,IT WORKS BECAUSE IT'S A METAL,IT WORKS CAUSE IT'SOME MEDDLE
5481,WE SEEN EACH OTHER BEFORE,WE'VE SEEN EACH OTHER BEFORE
5482,JUST DRAW THE TAPE THE SPIRAL THAT ROCK IN STUFF ARE ALL INSULATORS BUT A OTHER STUFF IS CONDUCTORS,THE STRAW THE TPE THE SPUNGH THE ROCK AND STUFF ARE ALL INSILLATORS BUT IT AL THO OTHER STUFF IS CONDUCTORS
5483,ONE THE METAL IS TOUCHING THE SWITCH SO I ALREADY KNOW THAT,SHING THE SWIN UHM THE MEDDAL IS TOUTCHING THE SWICH SO WE SHOUTED THEE
5484,THE NAIL,THE NAIL
5485,METAL IS SOMETHING IF SOMETHING'S METAL THEN AND IT STICKS TO SOMETHING ALL SIDES METAL THEN IT WOULD WORK AND IT WOULD COMPLETE CONDUCTOR,MEDDL IS SOMETHING IF SOMETHINGS O MEDDL THEN AND IT STICKS TO SOMETHING ELSE THAT'S MEDDL THAN IT WOULD WORK AND ET WOULD COMPLEAT A CONDUCTOR
5486,BECAUSE THE SWITCH IS METAL SO THAT'S METAL SO IT'S MAKE IN A WORK,CAUSE THI SWISHIS MEDDAL SO THAT'S MEDAL SO AT'TO MAKEING IT WORK
5487,INSULATORS ARE SOME STUFF THAT'S NOT METAL BUT CONDUCTORS ARE THINGS ARE METAL THAT MAKES JUST SITTING,INSTLATORS ARE SOME STUFF THAT'S NOT MIDDLE BUT UHM CONDUCTORS ARE THINGS THAT AREMIDDLE THAT MAKES  CUTITY
5488,IT'S NOT GOING BECAUSE IF THAT'S NOT METAL THEN WORK,IT'S NOT GOING CAUSE IF THAT NOT METLE THAN IT WON'T WORK
5489,I DON'T KNOW CAN YOU REPEAT THAT PLEASE,I DON'T KNOW CAN YOU REPEAT THAT PLEAS
5490,ELECTRICITY IS GOING TO THROUGH THE NAIL,IT LTRSTED HIS GOING THOUGH WITH A NAIL
5491,ITS OPEN,IT'S OPEN
5492,ALL THE OBJECTS WILL NOT MAKE ELECTRICITY GO,ALL THE OBJECTS WOIL NOT MAKE ELECTR CITY GO
5493,YEAH I'M GOOD HOW ARE YOU I KNOW YOU WE MET BEFORE BUT NO I DON'T WANT TO MEET YOU,YEM GOOD HOW ARE YOU I KNOW WYOU'VE MET BEFORE BU THOGH WHEN DONT WANT T MEAT YOU WHE
5494,BECAUSE THE SWITCHES OFF AND IT'S CREATING A CIRCUIT ELECTRICITY ALL AWAY TO THAT MOTOR,CAUSE THE SWISH ISF AND IT'S CRETING A CIRCUTE AND ELLECTRISITY ALL TAWAY TO THAT NANORTAINDING MOATOR
5495,THE FLAG IS BEEN MOVING BECAUSE THE D CELL HAS TO BE,THE FLAG IS IT MOVINGCAUSE THE DEAP SIL HASH TO WE HOOKED UP TO THE SWIP
5496,WHEN I CLICK THE SWITCH AND IT GOES ON THE METAL IT WORKS AND GOES TO THE MOTOR CIRCUIT IT CREATE ELECTRICITY OVER THAT IT IS ON IT WON'T WORK,WHEN I CLICK THE SWISH AND IT GOES ON THE MIDDLE IT WORKS AND GOES TO THE MOTOR SO IT CAN A CRE I LETRISITY BUT WHEN T IT IS ON IT WON'T WORK
5497,THE CELL IS HITTING THE MOTOR SO WHEN THE CELL HITS THE MOTOR THE WIRES IT ALWAYS TO THAT CELL AND THAT IT'S START WORKING,THE SUN IS HITING THE MOTOR SO WHEN THE SUN HET'S THE MOATOR THE WIRES HET ALL HWAY TO THE SELL AND THEN IT JUST START T WORKK
5498,IT WILL STOP WORKING BECAUSE IT'S NOT CREATING ELECTRICITY,IT WILL STOP WORKINGE BECAUSE IT'S LOT CRETING ACHES T
5499,IT IS HAVING THE ELECTRICITY GOING TO THE MOTOR MAKE A FLAG MOVE,IIS HAVING LCTRICITY GOING TO THE MOAR AND MAKE ITM FLAG THE
5500,IT DOESN'T WORK,IT DOESN'T WORK
5501,IT WORKS,IT WORKS
5502,IT DOESN'T WORK,IT DOESN'T WORK
5503,WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT CIRCUITS,WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT A CIRCUT
5504,BECAUSE IF IT DOESN'T HAVE IF THE SUN HAS TO HIT THAT LITTLE CONTRACTION THERE THEN IT WILL WORK,CAUSE IF IT DOESN'T HIT IF DHES TUN KNOWS IT HIT THAT LITTLE OTRASHIN THERE DIDN'T WILLT WORK
5505,WHEN YOU CLICK ON THE CELL ITS STARTS WORKING WILL A STOPS WORKING,WHEN I WHEN YOU CLICK ON THE SUN IT STARTST WORKING BUT WHANT S HA CLOUDY DAY  STOPPE YO WOR KING
5506,LET THE SWITCH HAS TO BE OFF,THE THE SWISH HAS TO BE OF
5507,THE D CELL IS PUT DOES THE ELECTRICITY ALL AWAY TO THE MOTOR AND MAKING THE FLAG MOVE,THE DETALL IS PRODUCEING ELLECTRICITY ALL THE WAY TO THE MOTR AND MAKING THE FLAG M
5508,NO,THOGH
5509,AND TILL,YOU TO
5510,THE CELL IS HITTING THE MOTOR AND THE MOTOR SET UP THE TWO WIRES ALL THE WAY TO THE CELL SO WHILE THOUGH THAT CELL DOES HITTING IT IT STARTS WORKING,THE SUN IS HITTING THE MOATOR AND THE MOATOR PIOK UP THE T WIRS ALL THE WAY TO THE SELL SO WHEN THE THE SUN IS HITING I IT IT STARTS WORKING
5511,WHAT,WHAT
5512,IT DOESN'T WORK,IT DOESN'T WHA
5513,THE FLAG MOVES,THE FLAG MOVES
5514,IT DOESN'T WORK,IT DOES I'T WORK
5515,ELECTRICITY,TEY
5516,THAT PUT DOES THE ELECTRICITY,TAT PRODUCEA E LECTURS
5517,IT'S CREATING A CIRCUIT THAT MAKES THE MOTOR RUN AND MAKES THE FLAG MOVE,IT'S CLEANING OF SCIKONS THAT MAKES THE MOATOR RUN AND MAKES THE FLYG BOO
5518,THAT IT RUNS WHEN THE FLAG MOVES BECAUSE THE CELL IS GAIN ELECTRICITY FROM THE SUN THAT TWO WIRES ARE HITTING THE MOTOR SO WAS THE TWO WIRES MAKE ELECTRICITY TO THE MOTOR THEN THE FLAG MOVE,THAT IT RUNS IN THE FLAT MOVES BECAUSE THE SELL IS GETNG A LEC TRISTING FROM THE SUN THE T WIRS ARE HITTING THE MOTOR SO HEN THE HEN THE T WIRES MAKING LTRISTITY TO THE MOTOR THEN THE FLAT MOVE
5519,THAT IT'S OFF THE D CELL IT'S OFF THIS THE METAL SO IT WON'T MOVE THE FLAG,THAT IT'S OF THE DEECEL IS OF THE S THE MEDAL SO IT WIL'T MOVE THE FLAG
5520,IT MAKES IT WORK,IT MAKES IT WORK
5521,IT WOULD BECAUSE IT'S NOT REALLY SUNNY,IT WOULDN'T WORK CAUSE IT'S NOT REALLY SUNNY
5522,OKAY,OK
5523,THE CELL HAS TO BE HITTING IT,THE SUN HAS TO BE HITING I
5524,GOOD,GOOD
5525,THEY MAKE ELECTRICITY GO THROUGH,THEN MAKE EA LECTRICITY GO THROUGH
5526,IT WOULDN'T WORK,IT WOULDN'T WER
5527,NOW ITS GOING THE OPPOSITE WAY BUT ITS GOING SAME WAY BUT IF WAS TURNED AROUND THEY WOULD BE GO IN THE OPPOSITE WAY,NOW IT'S GOING THE OPPOITE WAY BUT IT'S UGING THE SAME WAY BUT IF IT WAS TURNED RAN IT ULD BE GO ING THE OPOSITE WA
5528,ITS GOING THE DIFFERENT WAY ITS GOING LIKE THEN POSITIVE SIDE GO IN THE NEGATIVE SIDE GOING THESE WAY SO ITS GOING TO THE POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE SIDE BUT EVEN LIGHT BULB IS MUST BE ONE TO THE THAT'S I BUT ANYWAY ITS GOING THE OTHER,IT'S GOING THE DIFFERENT WAY IT' GOING LIKE THEN DEPOITIVF SIDES T GO ANDTE NEGETIVE SIDES GOING THIS WAY SO IT'S GOING TROUGHTHE POIT THE NEGT OFSIDE BUT EVEN NO THE LIKE OPAS PAS WOIM THROUGH THAT SIDE BU ANYWAY IT'S GOING THE OTHER
5529,LIGHT,LIGHT
5530,OKAY,OKA
5531,THAN IT WOULD WORK BECAUSE IF IT WAS JUST AT THE BA ARE THE TWO BASES OF BULB AROUND LIGHTS MUST GO UP THE LIGHT BULB SO I WERE WORK EASIER,THEN IT WOULDN'T WORK BECAUSE IF IT WAS JUST AT THE BA OF THE TWO BACES OF THA BULL THENT WOULDN' WORK AUSE THE WIE PSCLE UP THE LIFE BAB SO IT WILL BE WORK EASIER
5532,THE TWO WIRES ARE CONNECTED TO THE NEGATIVE AND POSITVIE SIDE AND THEN THE NEGATIVE GOES TO THE SIDE OF THE METAL OF LIGHT BULB AND THEN POSITVE SIDE GOES UP IN LIGHT BULBS ARE PRODUCES THE ELECTRICITY THROUGH THE LIGHT BULB,THE TWO WIRS ARE CONECTED TO THE NIGTVE AMPOSITIVE SIDE AD THEN THE  THENIGETIVE GOS TO THE SIDE OF THE MIDDLE OF TE LIH OL IN THE TE POUSITIVE SIDE GOS UP IN THE LI P SOT PRODUCES IS YELOTRICITY THROUGH THE LIGHE ALL
5533,I'M GOOD,AGOOD
5534,THE ELECTRICITY,ELTRS SEDY
5535,TWO WIRES HAVE TO BE CONNECTED TO MAKE A COMPLETE CIRCUIT,TWO WIRES HAVE TO BE CONECITED TO A  TO MAKE A COMPLEATE SURG
5536,IT HAS TO TAKE A PATH WHEN YOU COLLECT IT,HAVE TO MAKE A PATH WHEN YOU COLECTED
5537,COMPLETE CIRCUITS,COMPLETEORGETS
5538,IT LIGHT UP LIKE IN HER ON A LAMP ELECTRICITY GOES THROUGH AND IT GOES THROUGH UP AND THEN STILL MAKE US BACK UP,IT LIGHTS UP LEK AN HER ON A LAMP IT LOOKS JUS HE GOS THROUGH AND THEN O UP AND THEN I O MAKE GOS BACK O
5539,BOTH SIDE,BOTHSEI
5540,IT AS HOW YOU ELECTRICITY WAS TO WIRES,IT HAS  HA  LETRISCITY WITH TWO WIRES
5541,THAT THERE IS LIKE THE ELECTRICITY THE LIGHT BULB,THAT THERE'S ALWAYS E LTRISITY NG THO L LIFE OT
5542,ELECTRICITY,YO LOOKS OUR CITTY
5543,ITS NEGATIVE IN POSITIVE SIDE CONNECTED TO LIGHT BULB,IT'S A NIGITIVE ANDPOUSITIVE SIDE CONECTED TO THE LIGHT BAL
5544,I NOTICED THAT THE FLIP THIS THAT SHOULD I NOTICED THAT IF YOU'D PUT PUT IT TO THE NOT THE NEGATIVE SIDE THEY WILL GO UP THAT WAY BUT THE PEOPLE ON THE POSITIVE SIDE THEN YOU KNOW GO THE SAME WAY THAT IT WAS IN THE BEGIN,I NOTICE THAT IF YOU FLIP IT THIS THE  I NOTICE THAT IF YOU'D PU PUT IT TO THE NOT NEGITIVE SIDE THEN IT W'LL GO TO OPOSITE WAY BUT IF YOU PUT IT ON THE POSIT IESIDE THE NE L GO THE SAME WAY THAT IT WAS IN THE BIGIN
5545,ITS FLOWING THROUGHT THE LIGHT BULB AND TO THE POSITIVE SIDE,IT'S FLOWING THROUGH THE LIHPOLE INTO THE POSETEV SAD
5546,ELECTRICITY,E LEC TRISCITY
5547,IF THE CIRCUIT,IS A S
5548,DO YOU THINK ELECTRICITY,DO THING YOU LET YOU THID A
5549,THE TWO WIRES ARE CONNECTED AND THE METAL IS TOUCHING,THAT TWO LIRES ARE CONECTED AND THE MEDDALE IS TOUTCHING
5550,THEY SEE A LATER,I SEE A LATER
5551,BATTERY LIGHT BULB AND WIRE,BATERY LI AND WIR
5552,I DON'T KNOW,I DON'T KNOW
5553,THE NEGATIVE,THE NEGII
5554,ELECTRICITY,E LECTCITY
5555,THAT THEY CAN CONNCET TO EACH OF THEM BUT IF THERE IF THE TWO WIRES BOTH AT THE BASE OF THE SIDE OF THE LIGHT BULB IT GOING TO LIGHT UP HAS IT DOESN'T KNOW,THAT THEY CAN CONECT TO EACH OF THEM BUT IF THEY WERE  IF THE TWO WIRS WERE BOTH AT THE BACE OF THE SIDE OF THE LOT BULL IT WOULDN'T LIHTE UP AS IT DOES NOW
5556,THE PLY IS THAT IT HAS TO BE TOUCHING METAL WITH THE TWO WIRES AS WE TOUCHING THE LIGHT BULB THEN ORDER OF TWO,THE POINT IS THAT IT HAS TO BE TOCHING MEDLE WITH THE T WIRES AS T BE TOTCHING THE LIFEWAB IN ORDER FOR TO LET
5557,THE REALLY THROUGH THE WIRES INTO THE LIGHT BULB BACK INTO THE ONE POSITIVE,THROUGH IT THROUGH THE WIRES INTO TE LIGH ALL BACK INSO THE A POSETE
5558,YEAH,YEA
5559,LIKE IF EVERYBODY GOT THE SAME ANSWER IT MIGHT'VE TAKEN A LONGER TIME TO TEST OUT THIS EXPERIMENT,LIKE IF EVERYBODY GOT THE SAME ANSWER IT MIGHT HAVE TAKEN A LONG HER TIME TO TESST OUT THIS EXPERIMENT
5560,WELL UM THAT'S JUST KIND OF HOW SHE TOLD US TO SET IT UP,WELL UH THE JHIST KIND OF HAF SHE TOLD TOS
5561,LIKE IF I SAID IF I WAS GOING ONE TWO THREE AND I WAS DOING IT LIKE MAYBE BY MYSELF THEN UM I MAY'VE MISCOUNTED ONE AND THAT WOULD MESS UP THE WHOLE EXPERIMENT,LIKE IF I SAID IF I WAS GOING ONE TWO THREE AND I WAS DOING IT LIKE MAYBE BY MYSELF THEN UHM I MAY AF MISCOUNTED ONE AND THAT WONE MESS HAT THE HOLE IX PEMIT

5613,YEAH,MEH
5614,YEAH,YEA
5615,UM I FOR THE THIRTY EIGHT OR THE DIFFERENT LENGTH,UHM  FOR THE THIRTY EIGHT OR THE DIFFERENT LENGT
5616,THE SHORTER SWINGS UH SWING MORE TIMES THAN THE UM LONGER ONES,THE SHIRTER SWINGS U SWING MORE TIMES THAN THE UHM LONGER ONES
5617,YOU WOULD PROBABLY GET SEVENTEEN,YO OAD PROBLIAT SEVENTEEN
5618,YEAH,YEAH
5619,YEAH,YE
5620,THE NUMBERS OF THE S YOUR YOUR SWINGS AND THEN THESE NUMBERS ARE THE NUMBER OF YOUR LENGTH,THE NUMBERS OF THE SGOR SWINH AND THEN THESE NUMBERS ARE THE NUMBER OF YOUR LENGT
5621,AND THE THE TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTEEN STRING WITH THE PAPER CLIP AND A PENNY IT GOT FIVE,AND THE THE TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTEEN STRING WITH A PAPER CLIP AND A PENIN IT GOT FIVE
5622,SO LIKE THE UH WITH ONE PENNY THE TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTEEN WOULD STILL GET FIVE,SI LIKE THE U WITH ONE PENY THE TWO HUNDRED FIFTEEN WOULD STILL GET FIVE
5623,YEAH,YE
5624,WELL WE DID TRY UM I THINK TWO DAYS AGO UH EVERYBODY GOT A DIFFERENT UM LENGTH AND THEN SHE GAVE US THE TWO MORE PENNIES AND UM THAT DIDN'T SEEM TO CHANGE,WELL WE DID TRY UHM I THINK TWO DAYS AGO H EVERYBODY GOT A DIFFERENT UHM LENGTH AND THEN SHE GAVE US THE TWO MORE PENNIES AND UHM THAT DIDN'T SEEM TO CHANGE
5625,AND THEN,AND THEN
5626,THIRTY EIGHT,THIRTY EIGHT
5627,YOU WOULD YOU WOULD FIND YOUR LENGTH CAUSE EVERYBODY GOT THEIR OWN AND YOU WOULD FIRST FIND YOURS SO FOR MINE,YOU WOUD YOU WOULD FIND YOUR LENGTH CAUSE EVERYBODY GOT THEIR OWN AND YOU WOULD FIRST FIND YOURS SO FOR MINE
5628,UM I GUESS WE JUST I I DON'T REALLY UNDERSTAND THE QUESTION,UHM I GUESS WE JUST I I DON'T REL UNDERSTAND THE QUESTION
5629,ALL THE WAY UP TO TWENTY FIVE AND IT WAS A GRAPH LIKE THIS,ALL THEWY UP TO TWENTY FIVE AND IT WAS A GRAS LIKE THIS
5630,RIGHT RIGHT MMM HMM,RIGHTS RIGHT
5631,OR,OR
5632,CAN I HEAR MYS,KHERWAY
5633,UM SORRY,M THORY
5634,THAT WELL THE TWO HUN AND FIFTEEN WAS DANGLING FROM HERE KINDA JUST GOING LIKE THIS AND THEN MINE WAS GOING,THAT WELL THE TWO HUND AND FIFTEEN WAS STANGLLING FROM HERE KIND AST GO ING LIKE THIS AND THEN MINE WAS GOING
5635,HOW MANY SWINGS YOU'VE GOTTEN AND THEN ON THIS SIDE YOU WOULD WRITE DOWN YOUR LENGTH AND HOW MANY SWINGS YOU GOT,HOW MANY SWINGS YOU HAVE GOTEN AND THEN ON THIS SIDE YOU WOULD RITE DOWN YOUR LENGTH AND HOW MANY S THINGS YOU GOTT
5636,SO IF THAT WAS THE LENGTH THEN,SO OF THAT WAS THE LENGTH THEN
5637,YES,YES
5638,UM WE'VE BEEN WORKING WITH SWINGERS UM A PENDULUM,UHM WE'VEEN WORKING WITH SWINGERS UHM A PUNJLUM
5639,LIKE UM OUR FLIP STICK IS A POPSICLE STICK AND THERE'S SIX CENTIMETERS ON IT UNTIL THESE TWO COME IN SO IT'S LIKE ONE TWO THREE FOUR FIVE SIX,LIKE UHM ARE PSTICK AS THE POPSCAL STICK AND THERE SIX SEEMETORS ON IT UNTILL THESE TWO COMIN SO IT'S LIKE ONE TWO THREE FOUR FIVE SIX
5640,CAUSE THAT'S THE ONLY WAY YOU CAN GET YOUR RESULT,CAUSE THAT'S ONLY WAKING IT YOUR REZALT
5641,FOR EACH INCH SO LIKE FOR SIX INCHES WE DID FOUR TIMES AND THEN WE DIVIDED IT BY FOUR CAUSE WE DID IT FOUR TIMES AND THEN WE GOT OUR RESULTS,FOR EACH INCH SO LIKE FOR SIX INCHES WE DID FOUR TIMES AND THEN WE DIVIDED IT BY FOUR ECAUSE WE DIDN'T FOURY TIMES AND THEN WE GOT OUR RESULTS
5642,YEAH YEAH EVERYBODY DOES FOUR TRIALS ON EACH CENTIMETER,YEA EVERYBODY DOES FOUR TRYLES ON EACH SEND A METOR
5643,OH OH WE MOST OF THE TIME WE MAKE IT HIT TO THE LIKE THIS PART ALL THE WAY DOWN TO THE THE NEXT,OH OH WE MOST OF THE TIME WE MAKE IT HIT TO THE LKE THIS PART ALL THE WAY DOWN TO THE THE NEXT
5644,TWENTY,TWENTY
5645,BY FOUR,BY FOUR
5646,THE MORE FAR IT'S OUT IT GO THE ALUMINUM BALL GOES HIGHER AS IN LIKE IT UH THAT WE'RE WE'RE HAVING A MEASURING TAPE AND SOMETIMES IT GOES HIGHER THAN THE LIMIT,AND WERE FAR TS OUT IT GO THE ALOOMINAN BALL GO S HIGHER AS IN LIKE I AH THAT WERE IT WERE HAVING A MEASURING TAPE AND SOMETIMES IT GOS HIGHER THAN THE LIMIT
5647,YEAH UM LIKE WE KINDA DID TWO VARIABLES BUT IT'S COMING TOGETHER AS ONE SO WE'RE SEEING HOW FAR IN OR OUT THE STICK IS AND HOW IT AFFECTS THE BALL,HE YE UM LIKE WE COUNTE ED TWO VERY BULLS BUT IT'S COMING TOGETHER AS ONE SO WOR CING HOW FAR IN OR OUT THE STICK IS AND HOW IT FECT THE BALL
5648,YEAH,YEAH
5649,IT'S LIKE UM IT'S HOW FAR THE STICK IS SO TOTAL THE STICK IS TOTAL SIX INCHES SO WE KEEP PUSHING IT IN AND IN IN MORE AND MORE,IT'S LIKE UHM IT'S HOW FAR THE STICK IS SO TOTLE THE STICK IS TOTLE SIX INCHES SO WE KEEP PUSHING IT IN AND THEN AN MORE AND MORE
5650,WELL BECAUSE THE WEIGHT IF IT'S LIKE FORTY CENTIMETERS IT'LL DEFINITELY CHANGE EVERYTHING BUT TEN AND TWENTY AREN'T THAT FAR AWAY BUT IF IT WAS LIKE FORTY FROM TEN THAT WOULD MAKE A HUGE DIFFERENCE,WELL BECAUSE THE WAGHTE IF IT'S LIKE FOURTY SEVEN MENORS IT'L DEFENLY CHANGE EVERYTHING BUT TEN AND TWENTY AREN'THAT FAR AWAY BUT IF IT WAS LIKE FOURTY FROM TEN THAT WOULD MAKE A HUGE DIFERENCE

6090,THE TOP RIGHT,THE TOP RIGHT
6091,BECAUSE IT HAS TO SHARE THE PATHWAY,BECAUSE IT HAS TO SHEARE THE BATWA
6092,I THINK THAT THE BULB WILL BE BRIGHTER,I THINK THAT THE BUB WILL BEBIDHER
6093,THEY ARE LIKE THE FLOW OF ELECTRICITY,THEY ARE LIK FLOT OF LECTRISCITY
6094,THEY ARE ALL OR THEY HAVE THEIR OWN PATHWAY,U THE AE ALAV THEIR OWN CA
6095,THERE ARE TWO BATTERIES,THERE ARE TWO BATERES
6096,IT IS GOING IN THROUGH THE POSITIVE AND OUT THROUGH THE NEGATIVE,THE IT IS GOING IN THROUGH THE POSAND OUT THROUGH THE NA
6097,THEY HAVE TO SHARE A PATHWAY AND A D CELL,THEY HAVE TO SHEAR A PATH WAY ANDER DE SAL
6098,THERE ARE TWO WHOLE PATHWAYS AND THEY ARE DONE,THERE ARE TWO WHOLE PATHWAYS AND THEYRE D

6101,WHAT DID YOU SAY,WHAT DID YOU SAY
6102,I NOTICED THAT THERE ARE TWO PATHWAYS,I NOTICED THAT THERE ARE TWO PATHS WAY
6103,THEY ARE BRIGHTER,THEY ARE BRITE
6104,NO YEAH YEAH THERE IS ONE LIGHTBULB AND THE ONE TWO LIGHTBULBS,NO YEA YET THERE'S ONE IGH BOD AND THE OTHER ONE IT HAS TWO LIFE BUS
6105,I TOLD YOU A BILLION TO TRILLION ABOUT BILLION TIMES THERE ARE TWO PATHWAYS,I' TOLD YOUR A BILLION PATRILLION BUTBILLION TIMES THERE ARE TWO PATH WAYS
6106,WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT SERIES AND PARALLEL CIRCUITS,WE'VE BEEND LEARNING ABOUT SERIES AND PAROLI'L STAR GA

6115,THE DIRECTION IT IS GOING IN THROUGH THE POSITIVE AND OUT THROUGH THE NEGATIVE SIDE AND,ACKTHE DRECT SO ING IT IS GOING IN THROUGH THE POITI EN OUT THROUGH THE NAG OT ESIDE ON ERL
6116,I THINK THAT WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT THE LIGHT IS BRIGHT SO WE NEED A PARALLEL CIRCUIT,THINK THAT WE NEED MACK TURE THAT THE LIGHTS ARE BIG SO WE NEED THE POURLEL SIRCIT
6117,IT TURNS GREEN,IT TURNS GRE
6118,THE SERIES CIRCUIT IS DIMMER,UHM THE O SERIOUS SECOND IS DA
6119,I THINK THAT IT WILL BECOME BRIGHTER,H I THINK THAT IT WILL BECOME BRIGHTE
6120,WE'VE BEEN WORKING WITH SERIES AND PARALLEL CIRCUITS I'VE TOLD YOU LIKE A BILLION TRILLION BILLION TIMES YOU ARE THE MOST UGLIEST WOMEN IN THE,WEA BEEN WORKING WHAT SIRYES AND PARALOWSERGES I'M TOLD YOU LIKE A PIL CATRPILIAN DINS YOU ARE THE MOST ALYS TOP
6121,THEY DO NOT HAVE A DIRECT PATHWAY,UHM THEY DO NOT HAVE A DIRECT PATHWAY
6122,I DO NOT HERE SO PLEASE SAY IT AGAIN,I DID NOT HEAR YOU SO PLEASE SAY IT AGAIN
6123,EACH TYPE OF POSITIVE THERE ARE PATHWAY THERE ARE TWO PATHWAYS,EACH LIHWIL PAS ITS OWN PATHERY THEE AR TO PATH AWAY
6124,THERE IS ONE BULB THERE IS ONE D CELL AND TWO BULBS,THERE IS ONE BA THERE S ONE TY SEVEN TWO BA
6125,THE ONE ON THE BOTTOM LEFT IS BURNING OUT QUICKLY,THE ONE ON THE BOTTOM LAUGHED IS BURNING OUT QUICK
6126,THE ENERGY GOES DIRECTLY TO ONE DIRECTLY TO ONE LIGHT THEN IT SHINES BUT I THINK,THEGR GOES DIRECTLY TN UM U  TA  DIRECTLY TO WAN LIT THE N SHINS RL
6127,THAT IS WHY WE CALL DIRECT,THAT IS ALTHECAURECT
6128,THERE ARE TWO LIGHTS IN THERE,ITHEY THERE ARE TWO LIGHTS IN THERO
6129,THERE ARE TWO BATTERIES IN BOTH OF THEM,THERE ARE TWO BATERES IN BOTH OF THEM
6130,BECAUSE THEY HAVE TO SHARE EVENLY WITH BOTH OF THEM AND IT DOESN'T GO DIRECTLY AND IT ONLY GOES TO ONE LIGHTBULB,CAUSE IT HAS TO SHEAR EVENLY WITH BOTH OF THEM AND IT DOESN'T GO TO RAKBOA ONLY GOS ON BY  BOL
6131,IT'S ALWAYS GOING THROUGH ONE DIRECTION AND IT'S GOING INTO THE POSITIVE AND OUT THROUGH THE NEGATIVE,GI IT'S ALWAYS GOING THROUGH WAER RACSHON THEN IS AN IT'S GOING INTHROUGH THE POSTVE AND OUT THOUGTHOUT AADE
6132,NO,NO
6133,IT PATHWAY GOES TO THE BASE TO THE CASING,THE ATHIGERS GRE THE DD   ISH TOD THECAI D AT THE DA

6700,IT DEPENDS IF IT'S LIGHTER OR DARKER OR WEIGHS MORE THAN ONE ANOTHER,IT DEPENS IF IT'S LIGHTER OR DARKER OR WAVE MORE THAN ONE AOTHER
6701,BECAUSE OF ITS COLOR BECAUSE THE ONE THAT HAD THREE TEASPOONS IS VERY DARK THE ONE THAT ONLY HAS ONE TEASPOON IS VERY LIGHT,BECAUSE OF IT'S COLOR BECAUSE THE ONE THAT HAS THREE TEEESPOONES IS VERY DARK THE ONE THAT ONELY HAS ONE TEE SPOONE IS VERY LIGHT
6702,THAT THEY HAVE PUT MORE SOLVENT INTO IT MEANING THEY'VE PUT MORE SOLID OR POWDER INTO INTO THE LIQUID AND IT HAS NOW MADE A,THAT THEY HAVE PUT MORE SOLVENT INTO IT MEANING THEY'VE PUT MORE SOLLID OR POUDER INTO INTO THE LIQUID AND IT HIS NOW MADE A S

6705,I NOTICE THAT THE MORE POWDER YOU PUT IN LIKE IN THE WHAT THE CUP ON THE RIGHT THE SOLUTION ON THE RIGHT ON THE LEFT IS DARKER AND THE ONE ON THE RIGHT IS,I NOTICED THAT THE MORE POUDER YOU PUT IN LIKE IN THE  CUP ON THE RIGHT THE SILLUTION ON THE RIGHT ON THE LEFT IS DARKER AND THE ONE ON THE RIGHT IS LI
6706,BECAUSE IT'S NOT AS CONCENTRATED AS THE OTHER CUPS,BECAUSE IT'S NOT AS CONSENTRATED AS THE OTHER CUPS
6707,NOT AS GOOD BECAUSE IT DOESN'T HAVE ENOUGH GRAPE POWDER,NOT IS GOOD BECAUSE IT DOESN'T HAVE ENOUGH GREAT POUDER
6708,THAT'S BECAUSE THE SOLUTION IS NOW SATURATED,AT'S BECAUSE THIS SILUOTION IS NOWSATURATED
6709,IT IS BECAUSE YOU HAVE SHAKE THE SOLUTION AND PUT MORE WATER IN IT TIL IT SATURATE,IT IS BECAUSE YOU HAVE SHAKED THIS UDN AND PUT MORE WATER IN UNTIL IT SATCHRA
6710,WHAT,HE
6711,THAT IT'S BECAUSE YOU HAVE SATURATED THE SOLUTION,THAT I'S BECAUSE YOU HAVE SATURATED THI ALLOON
6712,HAVEN'T REALLY BEEN AT SCHOOL SO I HAVEN'T REALLY GOTTEN TO DO SCIENCE MOSTLY BUT WE HAVE BEEN DOING A LOT OF SATURATION,IHAVEN'T REALLY BEEN AT SCHOOLS SO I'VEN'T EALLY GOTEN ITWO SIENCE MOSTLY BUT WE HAVEN'T DRETN A LOT OF SAGORATI
6713,I DON'T CARE BLAH,IT CARE BLA
6714,ONE SOLUTION IS HEAVIER THAN THE OTHER,WHON SILOTION IS HAVER THAN THE OTHER
6715,BECAUSE YOU SUBTRACTED SIXTY SEVEN FROM FIFTY I MEAN FIFTY FROM SIXTY SEVEN,BECAUSE YOU' SUBTRACTED FI SIXTY SEVEN FROM FIFTY I MEAN FIFTY FROM SIXTY SEVEN
6716,HEY I DON'T KNOW PLEASE TELL ME,A YOU I DON'T KNOW PEASE TELL ME
6717,HAVE TO DO WITH SATURATION,HAVE TO DO WITH SACURATION
6718,YOU ARE TRYING TO SATURATE THE SOLUTION CAN SHE EVEN HEAR ME HELLO OKAY SHE CAN HEAR ME,YOU ARE TRYING TO THAT TREAT THESE SULUTION SHE VEN HEARE ME LEOKA SHE
6719,THAT THE THAT THE OTHER SOLUTION HAS TO WEIGH SIXTY SEVEN GRAMS,THAT THE AT THE OTHER SALOON HAS THE WAY SIXTY SEVEN GRANS
6720,THAT'S BECAUSE THE THE SOLUTION HAS SALT IN IT IT WEIGHS MORE THAN JUST A CUP,THAT'S BECAUSE THE ODE SILLTION HAS SALT IN IT AND WAS MORE THAN JUST A CUP
6721,IT HAPPENED BECAUSE THE WATER SLIPPED INTO A CRACK THEN FROZE AND BROKE THE REST OF THE PART I MEAN REST OF THE ROCK APART,IT HAPPENED BECAUSE THE WATER SLIPED INTO A CRACK THEN FROSE AND BROKE THE REST OF THE PART I MEAN REST OF THE ROCK AP
6722,WE HAVE BEEN STUDYING CHEMICAL AND AND PHYSICAL WEATHERING,WE HAVE BEEN STUDYING KEMICALE AND IN PHSICAL WEATHERIN
6723,WAIT WHAT,WAWRA
6724,I OBSERVED THAT THE WATER IS BREAKING THE GLASS BECAUSE IT HAS NO WHERE TO GO WHEN IT'S BEING FROZEN,I OBSERVED THAT THE WATER IS BREAKING THE GLAS BECAUSE IT HAS NO WHERE TO GO WHEN IT'S BEING FROZEN
6725,THAT THE FARTHER UP THE ROCKS ARE IN A STREAM THE BIGGER THEY ARE,WT THATHE FARTHER UP THE ROCK AR IN A STREAM THE BIGER THEY ARE
6726,ABRASION AND STUFF IS LIKE THAT,ABRASIAN AND STUFFIS LIKE THAT
6727,THAT SOME ARE BIGGER BECAUSE THEY'RE AT THE TOP OF THE STREAM AND HAVEN'T GOTTEN WORN DOWN THE OTHER ONES AT THE BOTTOM OF THE STREAM ARE SMALLER CAUSE THEY HAVE GOTTEN WORN DOWN,THAT SOME ARE BIGER BECAUSE THER AT THE TOP OF THE STREAM AND HAVEN'T GOTE WORN DOWN TH OTHERONES AT THE BOTOM OF THI STREAM ARE SMALLER BECAUSE THEY HAVE GOTEN WORN DOWN
6728,HAS TO DO WITH PHYSICAL WEATHERING BECAUSE THE WATER THAT HAS FROZEN INTO THE ROCK IS BREAKING THE ROCK APART,HAS TO DO WITH PHSICAL WIDERING BECAUSE THE WATER THAT HAS FROZEN INTO THE ROCK IS BREAKING THE ROCK APART
6729,IT EXPANDS,IT EXPANDS
6730,IT EXPANDS,DON'T IT EXPANS
6731,TREE ROOTS ARE GROWING INTO THE ROCK AND BREAKING IT APART,THREE ROOTS ARE GROWING INTO THE ROCK AND BREAKING IT APART AND BREAKING IT APART
6732,GOOD,GOOD
6733,WATER IS GOTTEN INTO THE CRACKS OF A ROCK AND IT HAS FROZEN IT IS MAKING BIGGER CRACKS IN THE ROCK ALMOST BREAKING IT APART,WATER HAS GOE INTO THE CRACKS OF A ROCK AND IT HAS FROZEN AND IS MAKING VIGER CRACKS IN THE ROCK ALMOST BREAKING IT A PART
6734,THE ROCKS AT THE BOTTOM OF THE OF THE STREAM HAVE BEEN WEATHERED HAVE BEEN WEATHERED THE MOST BECAUSE THEY ARE THE TINIEST,THE ROCKS AT THE BOTOM OF THE THE STREAM HAVE BEEN WETTHER THE HAVE BEEN WEATHERED THE MOST BECAUSE THEY ARE THE TINY
6735,THEY GET WORN DOWN BY THE RIVER BECAUSE IF THEY'RE AT THE TOP OF THE RIVER THEY START AT THE TOP AND GET PUSHED DOWN THEY WILL GET WORN DOWN INTO REALLY TINY PIECES OF ROCK,THEY GET WARN DOWN BY THE RIVER BECAUSE IF THAT THE TOP OF THE RIVER THEY START EDT THE TOP AND GET PUSH DOWN THEY WILL GET WARN DOWN INTO REALLY TINY PIECES OF ROCK
6736,BECAUSE THE FURTHER THE DOWN STREAM THE ROCKS ARE THE MORE WEATHERED THEY HAVE BEEN AND THE SMALLER THEY ARE,BECAUSE THE FTE BOWNSTRE THE ROCKS ARE THE MORE WEATHER THEY HAVE BEEN AND THE SMALLER THEY AR

7265,THAT IT IS WHITE,THA IT IS WHITE
7266,THAT IT SHOWS A X,THAT I SHOWS THE E
7267,THAT WHEN IT REFLECTS OFF OF THE BALL IT IS BLUE AND WHEN IT COMES IN IT IS WHITE,THE WINI REFLICS BOTP OF THE BALL IT IS BLUE AND WHEN IT GUMES AND IT IS WHI
7268,IT'S REFLECTING AND IT'S MAKING THE LIGHT GO BLUE AND THEN THE WHITE'S HITTING IT IT'S MAKING IT GO WHITE AND THEN IT'S REFLECTING BACK WITH THE WHITE LIGHT AND THEN IT'S REFLECTING THE OTHER WAY WITH THE BLUE LIGHT,IRBLAC ATS MAKING THE LIHTE A BLUE AND THEN THE WHITES HIDING IT I'S MAKING A GO WHITE AND THEN IT'S REFLECTING BACK WITH THE WHITE LIGHTE AND THEN'S REFLECTING IN THELEWY WITH THE BLUE LIGHTE

7271,IT'S ABOUT THE LIGHT POINTING TO A A CUBE AND IT IS DOING A RAINBOW,IT'S ABOUT THE LIGHT POINTING TO A A CUBE A IT IS DOING A RAINBOW
7272,THEY PUT A ORANGE LIGHT AND THEY A CUBE THAT'S RED AND THE LIGHT'S POINTING AND IT'S MAKING A RED BECAUSE IT'S REFLECTING RED,THEY PUL A ORDANGELY AND A A C U BT RED AND THE LIGHES POINTING AN IS MAKING A RED BECAUSE IT IT'S REFLECTING RED
7273,THEY ALL WORK,THEY ALL WORK
7274,THAT IT'S REFLECTING YELLOW,THE ITCH WEREFLECTING YELLO
7275,BECAUSE THE THE SQUARE IS BLUE AND WHEN IT HITS THE THING IT MAKES IT LOOK BLUE,BECAUSE THE BL THE THE SQUARE IS BLUE AND WHEN A HITS THE THING IT MAKES I LOK BLUE
7276,IT GOES INSIDE THE BALL AND IT REFLECTS BLUE LIGHT,IT GOES INSID THE BARN AIRO FLECXS BLEWE L

7384,IT CHANGED BECAUSE YOU PUT HIM YOU,IT CHANGED BECAUSE YOU B PUT HIM U
7385,THE,CSALT
7386,SO YOU MIX WATER ANY PUT AND NOW OPEN THE AND YOU POUR IT IN THE WATER CHANGE OUT PUT SOME MARBLE STAY,THOUGH YOU' MIXED A MARBLE WITH WATER AND YOU PUT A NET OVER THE BAL AND YOU PURE IT IN THE WATER JAINS OUT BUT THE MARBLE STAY
7387,IT IS DISSOLVING INTO OTHER THINGS,IT IS TE VALVING INTO OTHER THINGS
7388,IT IS DISSOLVING,IT IS TE VALVE THING
7389,THAT THE WHEN THE SALT WHEN YOU POUR WATER IN THE SALT IT DISAPPEARS AND NOT DISCLOSING MAKE SURE BUT YOU DON'T KNOW IT JUST LOOKS LIKE CLEAN WATER IN THAT IN THE WATER LOOKS LIKE GET STARTED,THAT THE WHEN THE'SALT WHEN YOU PORE WATER IN THE SALT IT JUSTAPPEARES AND THAT'S CALLED THOM MAXTURE BUT YOU DON'T KNOW IT JUST LOOKS LIKE PLEAN WATER IN THE DIRT IN THE WATER LOOKS LIKE THAT THE DIRT DIDN'T GET STIRT UP
7390,NO BECAUSE IT IS MIXED IN THERE AND WHEN YOU DRINK IT HE DOES NOT COME OUT,KNOW BECAUSEIT IS MIXED IN THERE AND WHEN YOU DRINK IT IT DOES NOT COME OUT
7391,IT IS THE DIFFERENT MIXTURE BECAUSE IT IS DISSOLVING AND TO A DIFFERENT THING WITH THE MOTOR,YOU KNEW SO DIFFERENT MXTURE BECAUSE IT IS DE VUALING AND TO A DIFERENT THING WITH THE GRAVEL IND WATER
7392,IT IS DISSOLVING INTO OTHER THINGS,IT IS DESOLVING INTO OTHER THINGS
7393,IT HAS SEPARATED AND THE,IT HAS SEPERATED AND THE
7394,THE,TTHAT

7409,WELL IT LOOKS LIKE IT LOOKS LIKE THAT THERE WAS,BLL IT LOOKS LIKE IT LOOKS LIKE THAT THERE WA
7410,ITS IMPORTNAT BECAUSE WE ARE SEPARATING THE STUFF AND BECAUSE SO WE KNOW WHAT MIXTURE,IT'S IMPORTANT BECAUSE WE ARE SEPORATING THE STUFF AND BECAUSE SO WE KNOW WHAT MIXTURES
7411,THAT WHEN TWO ARE MORE THINGS ARE PUT TOGETHER ITS CALLED A MIXTURE,THAT WHEN TWO ORE MORE THINGS R ARE PUT TOGETHER IT'S CALLED A MICTURE

7860,THE LONGER THE STRING IS THE LESS SWING SWINGS IT DOES,THE LONGER THE STRING IS THE LESS SWING SWINGS IT DOES
7861,SO YOU CAN SEE WHICH WAY IT WORKS BETTER,SO YOU CAN SEE WHICH WAY WORKS BETTER
7862,IT HAS WEIGHT AT THE BOTTOM,IT HAS WAITE AT THE BOTTOM
7863,IT GOES ALL THE WAY UP ON ONE SIDE THEN TO THE OTHER SIDE AND THEN BACK AGAIN,IT GOES ALL THE WAY UP ON ONE SIDE THEN TO THE OTHER SIDE AND THEN BACK AGAIN
7864,IN SCIENCE WE ARE LEARNING HOW TO COLLECT DATA,INSIGNENCE WE ARE LEARNING HOW TO COLLECT DATA
7865,IT GOES BACK AND FORTH REALLY FAST,IT GOSS BACK AND FORT HRELLY FAST
7866,DEPENDING HOW MUCH PENNIES ARE ON THERE IT WOULD GO SLOWER OR FASTER,PENDING HOW MUCH PENIYES ARE ON THERE IT WOULD GO SLOWER OR FASTER
7867,SO YOU,SAY
7868,THEY ALL HAD THE SAME NUMBER OF SWINGS,THEY ALLH HAD THE SAME NUMBER OF SSWINGS
7869,HI,BY
7870,THE STRING IS HANGING ON SOMETHING AND IT GOES BACK AND FORTH A FEW TIMES UNTIL IT STOPS SLOWS DOWN,THE STRING IS HANGING ON SOMETHING IND IT GOS BACK IND FORTH A FEW TIMES UNTIL IT STOPS SEOWS DOWN
7871,WE SEE WHAT CHANGED EACH TIME WE DID SOMETHING,WE SEE WHAT CHANNGED EACH TIME WE DID SOMETHING
7872,WELL THERE HAS TO BE SOME SORT OF WEIGHT AT THE BOTTOM SO THAT IT CAN SWING OTHERWISE IT WOULD JUST BE TOO LIGHT,WELL THERE HAS TO BE SOME SORT OF WAIGHT AT THE BOTTOM SO THAT IT CAN SWING OTHERWISE IT WOULD JUST BE TOO LIGHTE
7873,IT'S GOING GOOD HOW ABOUT YOU,S GOING GOOD HOW ABOUT YOU
7874,EACH ONE HAS A DIFFERENT AMOUNT OF PENNIES ON IT,EACH ONE HAS A DIFFERENT AMOUNT OF PENIES ON IT
7875,IT'S IN A PAPERCLIP HANGING FROM A STRING,IT'S IN A PAPER CLIP HANGING FROM A STRING
7876,PENDULUMS ARE THINGS THAT LIKE HANG FROM SOMETHING UM AND THEY CAN SWING BACK AND FORTH,PENGLLIMS ARE THINGS THAT LIKE HAGING FROM SOMETHING UHM AND THEY CAN SWING BACK AND FORTH
7877,YOU COULD CHANGE HOW HIGH IT'S HANGING,YOU COUNTAIND HOW HIGH IT'S HANGING
7878,WE MADE LITTLE LIFEBOATS AND UM AND THEN WE LIKE PUT PENNIES IN IT FOR THE PEOPLE AND SEE HOW MANY PEOPLE COULD GO IN BEFORE IT SANK,WE MADE LITTLE LIFE BOATS AND UM AND THEN WE LIKE PUT PENIES IN IT FOUR THE PEOPLE AND SEE HOW MANY PEOPLE COULD GO WHEN BEFORE IT SANK
7879,GOOD,GOOD
7880,THE BOAT WOULD START TO TIP OVER AND KIND OF START TO GO DOWN IN THE WATER,THE BOAT WOULD START TO TIP OVER AND CAN A START TO GO DOWN IN THE WATER
7881,THEY HAD TO BE THREE CENTIMETERS LONG,THEY HAD TO BE THREE SENEN METERS LONG
7882,WE USED THE DIXIE CUPS AND LIKE CUT UM AROUND IT TO MAKE IT SMALLER SO THAT I DON'T REALLY KNOW OH SO IT WOULD LIKE BALANCE,WE USE THE DICKSY CUPS AND LIKE CUT UHM AROUND IT TO MAKE IT SMALLER SO THAT I DON'T REALLY KNOW OH SO IT WOULD LIKE BLLNCE
7883,UM THE ONE ON THE LEFT SIDE IS BALANCED UPRIGHT AND THEN THE ONE ON THE RIGHT SIDE IS ABOUT TO SINK CAUSE IT'S UNBALANCED,ON THE ONE ON THE LEFT SIDE IS BALLONCED UP RIGHT AND THEN THE ONE ON THE RIGHT SIDE IS ABOUT TO STHINCAUSE ITS ON BALLNCED
7884,EACH ONE IS A DIFFERENT SIZE,EACH ONE IS A DIFFERENT SIZE
7885,IT MIGHT AFFECT THE NUMBER OF PASSENGERS BECAUSE IF THE WATER'S GOING ALL CRAZY THEN IT COULD CAUSE THAT CUP TO FLIP OVER,AD MIGHT EFECT THE NUMBER OF PASAGEN JURES BECAUSE IF THE WATER IS GOING  CRAZY THAN IT COULD CAUSE THE CUP TO FLIP OVER
7886,YOU NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU ALL UM THAT YOU PUT THE PENNIES IN EACH LIFEBOAT AT THE SAME HEIGHT AND LIKE NOT ALL AT THE SAME TIME LIKE ONE AT A TIME FOR EACH ONE,YOU NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU ALL UHM THAT YOU PUT THE PENIES IN EACH LIFE BOAT AT THE SAME HIGHT AND LIKE NOT ALL AT THE SAME TIME LIKE ONE AT A TIME FOR EACH ONE
7887,THEY'RE JUST DROPPING IT IN AND THAT CAUSES THE BOAT TO GET MORE PRESSURE PUT ON IT SO IT FALLS DOWN BEFORE THE LEFT SIDE DOES,THE'RE JUST DROPPING IT IN AND THAT CAUSES THE BOAT TO GET MORE PRESSUR PUT ON IT SO IT FALLS DOWN BEFORE THE LEFT SIDE DOES
7888,YOU WOULD PUT THE UM CUP IN THE WATER AND THEN UH PUT ONE PENNY IN AT A TIME TO SEE HOW LONG IT TOOK BEFORE IT SANK,YOU WOULD PUT THE UHM CUP IN THE WATER AND THEN U PUT ONE PENY IN AT A TIME TO SEE HOW LONG IT TOOK BEFORE IT SANK
7889,UM YOU GOT TO MAKE SURE THERE'S NO WATER IN THE BOAT OR ELSE UM OR OR ELSE IT COULD CAUSE THE BOAT TO GO DOWN MORE THAN IT WOULD IF THERE WAS NO NO WATER IN THE CUP,UH YOU GOT TA MACE URE THERE'S NO WATER IN THE BOAT OR ELSE UHM OR OR ELSE IT HAULD CAUSE THE BOAT TO GO DOWN MORE THAN IT WOULD IF THERE WAS N NO WATER IN THE CUP
7890,THEY PUT SO MUCH ON ONE SIDE THAT THAT SIDE JUST SUNK WITHOUT GETTING MORE IN,THEY PUT SO MUCH ON ONE SIDE THAT THAT SIDE JUST SUNK WITHOUT GETTING MORE IN
7891,GETTING FROM ONE PLACE TO ANOTHER IN WATER,GETTING FROM ONE PLACE TO ANOTHER IN WATER
7892,EACH TIME YOU PUT A PENNY IN IT SUNK A LITTLE BIT MORE,EACH TIME YOU PUT A PENY IN IT SUNK A LITTLE BIT MORE
7893,THE MORE PENNIES AND THERE'S MORE PENNIES IN THE TALLER ONE AND IN THE CUP A,THE MORE PENYES AND THERE'S MORE PENYES THAN THE TALLER ONE IN IN THE CUP A
7894,WE'VE BEEN UM MAKING LITTLE LIFEBOATS AND USING PENNIES AS PEOPLE AND DROPPING THEM IN AND SEEING HOW LONG IT TOOK FOR THE LIFEBOAT TO SINK IN WATER,WE'VE BEEN UHM MAKING LITTLE LIFEBOATS AND USING PENIES AS PEOPLE AND DROPPING THEM IN AND SEEING HOW LONG IT TOOK FOR THE LIFE BOAT TO SINK IN WATER
7895,WELL IF IT'S IF IT'S A BIGGER UM CUP THEN IT COULD PROBABLY FIT MORE PENNIES IN BEFORE IT SINKS,WELL IF IT'S IF IT'S A BIGGER UM CUP THAN IT COULD PROBLY FIT MORE PENYS THAN BEFORE IT SINKS
7896,SO IT DOESN'T MESS UP YOUR EXPERIMENT,SO IT DOESN'T MAS UP YOUR EXPERIMENT
7897,GROUP D HAS THE MOST PENNIES,GROUPT HAS THE MOST PENIES
7898,YOU HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU ONLY CHANGE ONE THING OR ELSE THAT YOU WON'T KNOW THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN OTHER THINGS THAT YOU DO CAUSE IT WOULD MESS UP THE EXPERIMENT,YOU HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU ONLY CHANGE ONE THING OR ELSE T YOU WON'T KNOW THE DIFERENCE BETWEEN OTHER THINGS THAT YOU DO CAUSE IT WOULD MESS UP THE EXPERIMENT
7899,THEY GOT A A LOT MORE PENNIES IN THE LEFT SIDE CAUSE THEY PUT IT IN MORE CAREFULLY,THEY GOT UHM A LOT MORE PENYES ON THE LEFT SIDE CAUSE THEY PUT IT IN MORE CAREFULLY
7900,YOU NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT EACH CUP IS EXACTLY THREE CENTIMETERS OR ELSE IT COULD CAUSE UM A BIG DIFFERENCE BETWEEN ONE CUP AND ANOTHER,YOU NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT EACH CUP IS EXACTLY THREE SENIMETERS OR ELSE IT COULD CAUSE UHM A BIG DIFERENCE BETWEEN ONE CUP ANDNOTHER
7901,NOTHING,NOTHING

7967,SEE THIS LITTLE PRETTY DOG AS SEE THE LUNCH AND HE'S GOING INTO ATTACK MODE AND SAYING BACK OFF I'M READY TO STRIKE OR HE SWINGS THIS IS NO POTENTIAL PREDATOR HE SAYS BACK OFF I CAN DEFEND MYSELF,SEES THIS LITTLE PRARY DOGATE AS ETHER LUNCH AN E'S GOING INTO A TACK MOAD AND SAYING BACK OF I'M READY TO STRIKE OR HES THINKS THIS IS NO POTENCTAL PRETOR HE SES BACK OF I CAN DEFEND MYSELF
7968,THIS IS UHM LOOKS LIKE WIND AND IT I DON'T THINK THAT PLANTS NEED WIND TO,THIS IS UHM LOOKS LIKE WIND AND THN I DON'T THINK THAT PLYAS NEED WIND TO SURV
7969,THING ABOUT PRODUCERS AND FOOD WEBS IS WITHOUT THE PRODUCERS EVERYTHING IS GOING TO DIE EVENTUALLY EVERYTHING'S GOING TO BE KILLED OFF BECAUSE THERE'S NO BASIC FOOD SOURCE THAT THE PRODUCERS GIVE,THING ABOUT PRODUCERS AND FOOD WEBS IS WITHOUT THE PRODUCERS EVERYTHING IS GOING TO DYE OFENJOY EVERYTHING IS GOING TO BE KILLED OF BECAUSETHERE'S NO BASTIC FOOD SART THAT THE PRODOUCERS GIF
7970,PLANTS NEED A PLACE TO LIVE SO THEY CAN'T JUST BE FLOATING IN AIR IN THE OCEAN THEY NEED A SUITABLE PLACE TO LIVE,PANC NEED A PLACE TO LIVE S THEY CAN'T JUST BE FLOATING IN MID AIR IN THE OCEAND THEY NEED A SUTIABLE PLACE TO LI
7971,YES THIS PLANT NEEDS WATER TO SURVIVE,YES THIS PLANT NEEDS WATER TO SURV
7972,IT AHS EVERYTHING IT NEEDS TO GROW IT HAS WATER CARBON DIOXIDE AND SUNLIGHT THAT MEANS THAT IT IS ABLE TO DO STUFF,IT HAS EVERYTHING IT NEEDS TO GROW IT HAS WATER GARMENT BY OXIDE AND SUNLIGHTE THAT MEANS AT IT IS ABLE TO DO STUFF
7973,WHAT'S GOING ON IS THE YEAST IS UHM BEING BREAKING ITS DORMANCY WITH THE SUGAR FROM THE GRAHAM CRACKER,WHAT'S GOING ON IS THE AS IS UHM BENG BREAKING ITS DORMANCAN WITH THE SHUGER FROM THE GRAND CRACK
7974,THEY MAKE THEIR FOOD THROUGH PHOTOSYNTHESIS SO THEY TAKE THE LIGHT ENERGY AND THEY MAKE IT INTO UHM THEY TAKE UHM THE LIGHT ENERGY AND THEY MAKE IT INTO SUGARS,THEY MAKE THEIR FOOD THROUGH POTASE ANDPICES SO THEY TAKE THE LIGHT ENERGY AND THEY C MAKE IT IN CHO AND S UHM THEY TAKE UHM THE THE LIGHT ENERGY AND THEY MAKE IT INTO SHUGERS
7975,THE PLANT NEEDS UHM CARBON DIOXIDE UHM SUN HEAT AND H O TWO,RTHE PLANT NEEDS UHM CARMAN Y OSIDE UHM SUN HEATS AND ACHO TO HEAR
7976,THIS ONE IS UHM SUN OR LIGHT AND HEAT AND THE PLANT NEEDS HEAT AND NO A LITTLE BIT OF HEAT BUT MOSTLY LIGHT TO SURVIVE,SONE IS SUHM SUN OR LIGHTS AND THE HEAT AND THE PLANT NEEDS HEAT AND A MO A LITTLE BIT OF HEAT BUT MOSTLY LIGHT TO SURVIVE

7979,WE HAVE BEEN STUDYING ABOUT HOW UH PLANTS GET THEIR FOOD AND THEIR NUTRITION,WE HAVEN'T STUDYING ABOUT HOW A PLANTS GET THEIR FOOD AND THEIR NEW TRICTIO
7980,SOME OF THE MAIN POINTS ARE WHAT PLANTS NEED TO GROW UHM THAT'S PRETTY MUCH THE MAIN POINT THAT WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT,SOME OF THE MAIN POINTS OR WHAT PLANTS NEED SHOU GROW UHM THAT'S PRETTY MUCH ON THE MAIN POIN WHAT WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT
7981,YOU DOING TODAY MARNI,BE DOING TODAY MAR
7982,YEAST IS A FUNGI THAT UHM IS USED IN BREAD,EAST IS A FUNGGUY THAT UHM IS USED IN BREAD
7983,THAT MAKES IT UNABLE TO SOME SIMPLE UHM LIKE FUNCTIONS LIKE BEING ABLE TO STAY ALIVE BECAUSE IT NEEDS CARBON DIOXIDE TO BE ABLE TO PRODUCE ENERGY,THAT MAKES IT UN ABLE TO DO SOME SIMPLE UM LIKE FUNTIONS LIKE BEIN ABLED TO STAY ALIVE CAUSE IT NEEDS CAR CAREN BY OCSIDE SHOD BE ABLE TO PRODUCE ENARGY
7984,GOING ON IS IT HAS WATER WHICH IS GOOD IT HAS SUNLIGHT BUT IT HAS NO CARBON DIOXIDE SO THE PLANT IS NOT BEING ABLE TO FUNCTION WITHOUT THE CARBON DIOXIDE,OION ITS IT HAS WATER WHICH IS GOOD IT HAS SUNLIGHT BUT HAS NO CARMN Y OXSIDE SO IT THE PLANS NOT BEING ABLE TO FUNCTION WI HAV THE CARM DY OXSIDE
7985,PLANTS NEED THINGS LIKE CARBON DIOXIDE TO HELP UHM CREATE ENERGY THE WATER IS USED FOR ENERGY AND THE LIGHT IS USED FOR ENERGY,PLANTS NEED THINGS LIKE CARMAN BYOKSIDE TO HELP UHMCRE ENARGY THE WATER IS USED WITH FOR ENARGY AND E LIGHT IS USED FOR ENEARGY
7986,WILTED IS THE NAME SAME THING FOR LIKE DRIED UP NO WATER MEANS IT'S PRETTY WILTED,WILLTES IS THE NAIM SAME THING FOR LIKE DRIED UP NO WATER MEANS IT'S PRETTY WILTED
7987,THE PLANT HAS SUN IT HAS AIR BUT IT DOESN'T HAVE ANY WATER OR IT WASN'T GIVEN ANY WATER SO THAT MEANS THAT IT HAS NO WATER TO HELP THE PLANT GROW,THE PLANT HAS SUN IT HAS AIR BUT IT DOESN'T HAVE ANY WATER OR WASN'T GIVEN ANY WATER SO THAT MEANS THAT HAS NO WATER TO HELP THE PLANT GROW
7988,THAT MEANS A BEAR IS AN OMNIVORE,THAT MEANS THE BEAR IS AN OVAR
7989,PLANTS ARE PRODUCERS BECAUSE THEY MAKE THEIR OWN FOOD THROUGH PHOTOSYNTHESIS FROM THE SUN AND THEY ALL AND IF THEY IF YOU TAKE AWAY THE PLANTS SLOWLY THE WHOLE FOOD CHAIN WILL COLLAPSE,PLANTS ARE PRDUCERS BECAUSE THEY MAKE THEIR OWN FOOD TOTL SETORCES FROM THE SUN AND THEY 'LL IN UHM  IF THEY IF YOU TAKE AWAY THE PLANTS S SLOWLY THE WHOLE FLOODE CHAIN WILL COLLAPSE
7990,A MOOSE IS A HERBIVORE BECAUSE IT EATS LITTLE GRASS OUT OF THE LAKES AND IT EATS TREES TOO,A MOOSE IS A URBEFORE BECAUSE IT EATS UHM LITTLE GRAS OUT OF THE LEGS AND  EATS TREES TOO
7991,IT HAS TO DO WITH WHAT WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT BECAUSE IT'S ALL ABOUT THE CARNIVORES AND ALL THAT STUFF AND HOW THEY HOW THEY STAY ALIVE,IT HAS TO DO EL WE BEEN TALKING ABOUT BECAUSE IT'S ALL ABOUT THO CARN BOARS UHM ON ALL THAT STUFF AND HOW THEY HOW THEY STAY A L
7992,HERBIVORES MEANS YOU EAT ONLY PLANTS NOTHING ELSE,ERBIVARS MEAN THAT YOU EAT ONLY PLANTS NOTHING ELSE
7993,CONNECTS TO BEING A CARNIVORE BECAUSE IT CARNIVORES ONLY EAT MEAT THAT MEANS THEY'RE A SECOND LEVEL CONSUMER OR HIGHER BECAUSE YEAH,CANNEXTO BEING A CARNOBAR BECAUSE IT EAT CARNPORTS ONLLY EAT ME THAT MEANS AURE A SECOND LEVEL CONSTUMER OR HIGHER BECAUSE  UHM YE

8115,WHEN THE CIRCUIT GOES ROUNDS AROUND AND AROUND THE FLAG SPINS AND IT GIVES ELECTRICITY OR IF IT'S A CIRCUIT THE LIGHT BULB LIGHTS UP,WHEN THE CIRCUTE GOES ROUND ROUND AND AROUND THE FLAG SPINS AND IT GIVES E LECTRICITY OR IF IT'S A CIRCET THEN  THE LIGHT BALL LIGHTS UP
8116,IT'S UM IT'S LIKE,T'S IT'S UHM IT'S LIKE
8117,THAT WHEN THERE'S UM ONE D CELL IT WON'T WORK BECAUSE YOU NEED ANOTHER ONE TO CONNECT THE OTHER ONE BUT IF THERE'S TWO D CELLS IT WILL WORK BECAUSE IT'S ALL CONNECTED TOGETHER,THOW WHEN THERE'S UHM ONE DAY SELL IT DOESN'T WORK BESE YOU NED ANOTHER ONE TO CONECT THAT ONE BUT IF THERE'S TITY SAE IT WILD WORK BECAUSE IT'S ALL CONECTED TOGETHER
8118,I DESCRIBED THAT WHEN I CLICK ON IT UM WHEN IT'S THE OPPOSITE IT'LL WORK BUT WHEN IT'S THE SAME LIKE NEGATIVE INTO NEGATIVE POSITIVE TO POSITIVE IT WON'T WORK SO YEAH,I DSCRIBE THAT WHEN I CLICK ON IT UHM WHEN IT'S THE OPPOSIT ILL WORK BUT WHEN IS HE SAME LIKE A NEGTIVINTONEGITI POTE POSITIVE IT WON'T WORK S OH YEH
8119,THE UM THAT IT'S HARDER TO CONNECT THEM,THE UHM THEN IT'S HARDER TO CONECT HIM
8120,UM THAT THE WIRES ARE CONNECTING TO THE BATTERY AND THE OTHER WIRES CONNECTED TO THE OTHER BATTERY AND THEY'RE BOTH CONNECTING TO THE SPOT WHERE THE LIGHT BULB IS LIT,UHM THAT THE WIREAR CO COECTING TO THE THE BADRY AND THE OTHER WIE CONECTED ITHE OTHER BTTERYAND THERE BOTH CONECTING TO THE SPOT WHERE THE LIT BLIT BOB IS LI

8445,IT BREAKS,IT BREAKS
8446,I SEE THAT LIGHT BULB IS NOT WORKING BECAUSE THE SWITCH IS IN ON IS LIKE HOLDING THE ELECTRICITY IS GOING THROUGH LIGHT BULB,I SEE THAT THE LIPO IS NOT WORKING BECAUSE A SWICH IS AN ON IS LIKE HOLDING THE LECTRICSITYEVE FOR GOING THOU THE LI
8447,I NOTICED THAT IT DOESN'T WORK ANYMORE BECAUSE ONE OF THE LIGHT BULBS,I'VE NOTICED THAT U IT DOESN'T WORK ANYMHORE BECAUSE ONE OF THE LABLS
8448,SERIES CIRCUIT,REE STAR
8449,WE REALLY IT DOESN'T WORK ANYMORE BECAUSE LIKE WELL WHAT ARE LIGHT BULBS DOES WORK BUT THE OTHER ONE,UE W IT DOESN'T WORK ANY MORE BECAUSE TLHEYK WELL ONE OF THE LIFE BAMS DOES WORK BUT THE THERE ON
8450,WE HAD SEEN A SERIES CIRCUIT AND A PARALLEL CIRCUIT,YOU SEEN A SERIE CIRKET AT A PALA
8451,LIGHT IS,STRING AND WHIE IS
8452,I WILL NOT KNOW ACTUALLY,UHM I DON'T NOT KNOW ACTUALLY
8453,IT WILL WORK ANYMORE BECAUSE IT'S LIKE THAT STRATEGIES HOLD BACK,IT WIL'T WORK ENY MORE BECAUSE TH SLAKETAEA THE ENDARGY IS HOLD BAC
8454,BECAUSE THE SWITCH IS IN BECAUSE THE SWITCH IS IN THERE,BECAUSE THE SWISH IS  BECAUSE THE SWISH ISN'T THERE
8455,TO THAT CURRENT STOPS,TIL THE CURT STOPS
8456,I DON'T KNOW,I DON'T KNOW
8457,A SERIES,A TERI
8458,I THINK THAT THE BATTERY,I THIK THAT THE BATTER
8459,MAY IT DOESN'T WORK OR REALLY THE OTHER ONE DOESN'T WORK,MAYBE IT DOESN'T WOR OR A  LOVE AND WHAT DOESN'T WORK
8460,A PARALLEL CIRCUIT,UP CARO FANK GAT
8461,I DON'T KNOW,I DON'T KNOW
8462,LIGHT BULB GROW SO IT DOESN'T WORK SO THAT IT HAS TO BE DIFFERENT ANOTHER,EBELL BROKE SO IT DOES N'T WORK SO THA THEN I HAS TO CHANGE I FOR AN A THE
8463,MAY BE BECAUSE IT'S GETTING TOO MUCH LIGHT,U MAYBE BECAUSE IT'S GETTING TOO MUCH LIGHT
8464,YOU KNOW THAT IS,YU KNOW THAT
8465,WE KNOW THAT THERE IS A BATTERY THAT THIS THREE WIRES THERE IS A SWITCH,WE KNOW THAT THEREI'S A BADYAB THAT THERE'S THREE WIDERISTHE SWICH
8466,I DON'T KNOW,I DON'T KNOW
8467,OF THE BATTERY,THERS AN THE BADERY
8468,THAT ONE OF THE LIGHT BULBS BROKE,THAT WHAT OF THE LIMDBULBS BROKE
8469,THE LIGHT THE TWO LIGHT BULBS ARE LIGHTING BECAUSE THE OTHER ONE IS BROKEN AND THEN WHAT THEY DO WHAT THEY WILL WAS IT DOESN'T WORK,A DOE THE IT  DELGHT THE TWO LIFE UBS ARET LADY BECAUSE THETHER WHAT IS BROKEN AND THEN WHAT THE DO WOK WHAT THO DO WHA IT DOESN'T WORK
8470,THERE WERE THE LIGHT BULBS WERE LIGHTING BUT THERE IS THE OTHER ONE BROKE AS THEY DID A STUFF LIGHT I GET THAT THEY GOT IT OTHER ONE AND IT STARTED LIGHTING AND THAT,UHNEVER THE LIHPLS WERE LIGHTING BUT THEN THE OTHER ONE BROKE AND THEY DIDA STUP LIGHTING AND THEN THEY GOT A DEOTHER ONE AND THEY STARTED LIGHTING AGAIN
8471,BREAK,BRAT
8472,BULB STARTS WORKING BECAUSE LIKE WITH THE SWITCH WAS OUT IT WAS HOLD THAT ENERGY FROM THE LIGHT BULB,UM STARTED TO WORKING BECAUSE LINKT WHEN THE SWISH WAS OUT IT WAS HOLDING THE ENERGY BACK FROM THE LIHEBALL
8473,WORK ANYMORE BECAUSE IT'S STANDARD IS DOESN'T WORK,ON'T WORK ANY MORE BECAUSE IT STEADEND ITS DOES N' WOR
8474,IT'S NOT A COMPLETE CIRCUIT,IS NOT A COMPLEETE CIRCU
8475,THE FLOW THE ELECTRICITY IS GOING THROUGH ALL THREE WIRES,UM THE FLO IS THE LOOKRSI IS GOINTO ALL THE THREE WIRES
8476,THERE IS A SWITCH FOR A NEW ONE,A BAYIS SWISCHE FOR A NEW ONE
8477,ANY MORE THIS CAN NO LIGHT GETTING,H BOR AND THISNO GE
8478,ANY MORE,AY MORE
8479,WOULD YOU SPEAK A LIGHT IS PARTY,WHAT A STRINK A LIGHT IS MARNY
8480,SERIES CIRCUIT,FERY SIR
8481,SEE THAT I HAD RECEIVED A PARALLEL CIRCUIT A SERIES CIRCUIT,SEE TA I'V SEEN A PARLELE CIRCUT A TERY CIRCKUET A
8482,WE'VE BEEN LEARNING HOW TO COMPLETE A CIRCUIT,WE'VE BEEN LEARNING HAD A COMPLEET SERGIT
8483,SO,SO
8484,INSULATORS ARE HELPFUL,INSLATORS AR ARE HEALTHFUL
8485,ITS STARTS TO MOVE BECAUSE IT'S LIKE LIKE HAPPY ITS ENERGY,IT STARTS TO MOVE BECAUSE IT'S LIKE LIKE HAPY IT'S GETTING ON EAR
8486,I SEE THAT THE MOTOR IS MOVING BECAUSE WHEN I PUT THE PAPER CLIP ON TOP OF THE SWITCH IT STARTED TO MOVE,I SEE THAT THE MOATOR IS MOVING BECAUSE WHOL NOT PUT THE PIPPER CLIP ON TOPP OF THIS SWISH IT STARTED TO MOVE
8487,BECAUSE IT'S NOT A SOURCE OF ELECTRICITY OR A PIECE OF ENERGY,BECAUSE IT'S NOT A SORT OF ACITY FOR A PIECE OF AN D
8488,GOOD,A
8489,THE MOTOR IS MOVING ITS LITTLE FLAG BECAUSE THE SWITCH IS TURNED ON,THE MOATOR IS MOVING ITS LITTLE FLAG BECAUSE THE SWITSH IS TURNED O
8490,THE CIRCUIT WILL RUN BECAUSE IT IS LIKE ITS METAL AND IN ORDER FOR IT TOWARDS THAT NEEDS METAL,THE CIRCKUET WILL RUN BECAUSE IT'S LAKE IT'S MEDLE AND IN ORDER FOR IT TO WORK AND NEEDS MEDDLE
8491,ALL INSIDE IT AND THEN IT WANT,POTLE INCITED AND THEN E WON'T
8492,I MEAN THAT IS NOT GETTING ENERGY BECAUSE THE SWITCH IS AT ON AND THE WOOD STICK IS LIKE ISN'T A TYPE OF METAL SO IT WON'T WORK,IT MEANS THAT IS NOT GETTING ENORGY BECAUSE THE SWITCH IS AN ON AND THE WHOET STICK IS A NAIKE ISN'T A TYPE OF METL SO AT IT WON'T WOR
8493,CONDUCTING MATERIALS ARE HELPFUL BUT THE REST OF THAT AREN'T WHERE IT'S TO OTHER WAY OVER CAN YOU TELL THAT MARNIE,U CONDUCTING MATERIALS OR HELTHFUL BUT THE BREST OF THEM AREN' OR IT'S THE OTHER WAY AROUND CAN YOU TEL MET THEM OR NEE
8494,THAT WHEN YOU PUT THE WOOD ON THE WOOD STICK IT IS NOT WORKING ANYMORE BECAUSE IT'S NOT TYPE OF METAL OR ITS TYPE OF SOURCE TO MAKE IT,THAT WHEN YOU PUT THEWOOD WOD UM THE WOOD STICK IT ISN'T WORKING ANYMORE BECAUSE IT'S NOT A TYPE OF METAL OR  TYPE OF SURCE TO MAKE IT
8495,IT DOESN'T WORK BECAUSE IT'S NOT LIKE STORE OF ENERGY AND BECAUSE A BATTERY WORKS BECAUSE THAT HAS STORED ENERGY INSIDE IT SO,IT DOES A WORK BECAUSE IT'S NOT A SORE OF ENAGY AND IT BECAUSE A BADERY WORKS BECAUSE IT HAS STO ENARGY INSIDE IT SO
8496,I SAID THAT YOU NEED A BATTERY WHICH HAS STORED ENERGY INSIDE IT AND THEN YOU NEED TWO WIRES A SWITCH AND A MOTOR,I U SAID THAT YOU NEED A BATORY WHICHESTED ENARGY INSIDE IT AND THEN UHM YOU NEED TWO WIRES A SWITCH AND MOATER
8497,WELL I THINK THAT THE LIGHT THE DOTS ARE THE ENERGY AND LIKE THAT'S WAS JUST SPEAKING THE LIGHT BULB BRIGHTER,WELL UHM I THINK THAT THE LA THE DOT ARE THE NARGY AND THEY THAT WAS SMAKING TE LITBL RITER
8498,IT'S JUST TO BE IN A CIRCLE IS VERY HELPFUL BECAUSE THEY HAS BECAUSE THE BATTERY IS GIVING IN ENERGY TO THE D CELL THAT'S HOW THE LIGHT BULB IS GETTING THE ENERGY IMPROVEMENT,THE CHUR TID ANOUGH TIKET IS VERY HELPFUL BECAUSE IT HAS BECAUSE IT THE BATTERYS GIVING  ENARGY TO THE DEETAI NHETS HOW THE THOUGH OF LIF BAB IS GETTI THE ENRGY AD BARA
8499,I DON'T KNOW,I DON'T KNOW
8500,THAT WHEN THOSE ONE LIGHT BULB IT JUST ONE FOCUS AND LIKE WHEN THERE IS A ONE BATTERY IT DOESN'T LIGHT AS MUCH AS THE SECOND ONE BECAUSE THERE IS TWO FOR EACH ONE,BAT WHEN THERE'S ONE LIKE ALL IT'S JUST ONE FOKIS AND TLK WHEN THERE'S ONE BADERY IT DOESN'T LIGHTE AS MUCH AS THE SECOND ONE BECAUSE THERE'STUER EACH ONE
8501,ITS IT WAS THE LIGHT BULBS TURN BRIGHTER BECAUSE IT'S USING TWO BATTERIES AND SO THAT IS TWO STORED ENERGIES INTO LIGHT BULBS,IT'S UM IT WAS THE LIGHE OBSTURNED BRITER BECAUSE IT'S USING TWO BATTERES AND SO THA IS TWO STORE INERCHIES IN TO LIK ULBS
8502,THERE ARE ONE TWO THREE FOUR THERE IS FOUR PATH WAYS TO A SERIES CIRCUIT,THERE ARE ONE TWO THREE FOUR THERE'S FOUR PATH WAYS TO A SERIEUS SCIRCUE
8503,I THINK THE WORK MAY BE,UM I THINK A'LL WORK MAYBE
8504,THE ENERGY STORED IN THAT BECAUSE IT'S GIVING ENERGY TO THE LIGHT BULBS,UM THE ENARGY IS TH WARDON STUFFPED BECAUSE IT'S GIVING ENARGY TO THEVIPLBS
8505,I THINK THE LIGHT BULBS ARE GOING TO BE BRIGHTER BECAUSE IT'S USING TO TUBE A D CELLS AND LIKE THEY HAVE STORED ENERGY SO IT WILL WORK,THA I THINK THE LIFBOLBS ARE GING TO BE BRIGHTER BECAUSE IT'S USING TO T U TEELS AND LIKE THEY HAVE SWARD ANORD SO  WORK
8506,CAN YOU REPEAT THAT,EORYU
8507,FLOW IN LIKE THE BATTERY AND IT HAS TO HAS TO GO THROUGH THE LIGHT BULB THE WIRES THE D CELL AS TO GO THROUGH LIGHT HAS TO GO THROUGH IT HAS LOT OF THINGS,FLOW IN LIKE THE BNDRY AND IT HAS TO GO THR I HAS TO GO THROUGH THE LIBE BUB THE WIRES THAT SE SA HAS TO GO THROUGH WHIE IT HASE TO GO THO AIR IT HAS TO GO THOG A LOT OF THING
8508,I THINK THAT IS THE WIRE IS GETTING ENERGY AND ITS GOING INTO THE LIGHT BULBS SO THE LITTLE BLUE DOTS ARE LIKE THE ENERGY COMING,I THINK THAT IS THE THE WIRES GETTING ENARGY AND IT'S GOING INTO THE LIFEUP SO THE LITTLE BLUE DOGS ARE LIKE THE ENRGY COMING
8509,IT'S TO BE TOUCHING D CELL AND THE WIRES BECAUSE THE WIRES ARE GOING TO GAIN ENERGY AND BY THAT ONE IS GOING TO BE LIKE A REALLY FUN AND STUFF LIKE THAT SO JUST GET ON THE LAST PART,'S TI BE TOUTCHING DESAILL IN THE WIERES BECAUSE THE WIES WHOR CAN O HELP TO GE UHM INRGRY I HVEN BYTHUTOR IT'S ING  BE LIKE REALLY FUN ANDSS I AN SAID HIS GESST ON THE LAST PAR
8510,BECAUSE THEY NEEDS ANOTHER WIRE CONNECTING TO THE PLUS OF THE WIRES AND THERE ARE NOT SUPPOSED TO BE TOUCHING,BECAUSE IT NEEDS ANOTHER WIRE CONNCTING TO THE PLS OF THE WIRES AND THEY DORN'T SUPPOSED TO BE TOUTCHING
8511,CONNECTING THE SERIES CIRCUIT LIKE IT WOULD NOT BE THE BRIGHT ANYMORE WELL IT WILL BE BRIGHT BECAUSE IT'S ONLY USED I THINK IT WON'T WORK AND I THINK REALLY WORK LIGHT BULBS,BNK THE SERY IS FORGE IT IT WOULD NOT BE THAT BRIGHTE ANYMORE WILLE IT WILL BE BRIGHTE BECAUSE ITS ONLY YOU I THINK IT WON'T WORK AND IIT WI WILL WORK BUT  LIE ALLVES WRT
8512,MAY BE BECAUSE IF THE WIRES ARE THE BATTERY IS GIVING ENERGY TO THE WIRE AND THAT'S WHY THE LIGHT BULB IS SHINING AND ITS VERY VERY VERY VERY BRIGHT,UHM MAYBE BECAUSE IF THE WIR AR THE BATDERYS GIVING ENEARGRY TO THE WIERES AND THAT'S WY THE LIGHT BOB IS SHINING AND IT'S VERY VERY VERY V YURIGHT
8513,HE IS A COMPLETE FORMAT FOR A LIGHT BULB TO WORK,IT IS A COMPLEET TORMAT FOR A LIBLE TO WORK
8514,IT'S LIKE THE ENERGY IS GIVING THE ENERGY IT'S CALLED TO THE LIGHT BULB AND THAT'S HOW ITS GIVING ENERGY I GUESS,IT'S LIKE THE ENEARGY IS GIVING THE AO GH IT'S GOT TO THE LIBOB AND THAT'S HOW IT'S DOING ENARGY I GASKED

9031,WHEN IT IS CONNECTED UM NOT INCORRECTLY OR WHEN THE SWITCH IS OPEN,ONE IS CONECTED UHM NOT INCORECTLY OR WHEN THE SWISH IS OPEN
9032,IT CUTS IT OFF,IT CUTS IT OFF
9033,I HAVE TO GO MARNIE,IHAVE TO GO MORNY
9034,WELL,THE LECTRISITY HAS T BE FLOWING AROUND OR ELSE THE ENARGY WON'T REACH UHM THE MAGNETS SO IT WON'T WORK
9035,HI MARNIE,HI'ME ALREADY
9036,TEMPORARY MAGNETS DON'T LAST VERY LONG,TEMPERARY MAGNETS DON'T LAST VERY LONG
9037,YOU CAN MAKE AN ELECTROMAGNET,YOU CAN MAKE AN LLECTRAL MAGNET
9038,WELL UM YOU'RE REALLY UM GOOD ABOUT TALKING S UM CLEARLY AND BUT YOU KIND OF BUT YOU'RE STILL A LITTLE BIT CHOPPY,WELL UHM YOU'RE REALLY UHM GOOD ABOUT TALKING UHM CLEARLY AND BUT YOU KIND BUT YOU'RE STILL A LITTLE BIT CHOPY
9039,UM WE ADDED MORE WELL WE HAD SPACERS AND WASHERS AS YOU KNOW AND WE PUT THE SPACERS BETWEEN THE MAGNETS AND THE WASHERS ON THE OTHER END,UHM WE ADDED MORE WELL WE HAD SPACERS AND WASHERS AS YOU KNOW AND WE PUT THE SPACERS BETWEEN THE MAGNETS AND THE WASHERS ON THE OTHER AND
9040,IT HAS TOO MANY WASHERS SO THAT THE MAGNETS LOSE THEIR MAGNETIC FIELD,IT HAS TOO MANY WASHERES SO THAT THE MAGNETS LOS HEIR MAGNETIC FIELD
9041,WE UM GROUP A GROUP B AND GROUP D HAVE THE SAME RESULTS CAUSE THEY PROBABLY DID THE SAME THING AND GROUP C HAS REALLY LOW UM,UM GROUP A GRUPY AND GROUPTY HAVE THE SAME RESOLT CAUSE THEY PROLY DID THE SAME THING AND GROUP CE HAS REALLY LOW UHM
9042,GETTING FURTHER APART,RE GETTING FURTHER APART
9043,WELL THEY HAD BETTER UM,WELLE THEY HAD BETTER UHM
9044,YEAH BECAUSE THERE WAS SUCH A BIG DROP LIKE FROM NINETEEN NINE THAT'S TEN WASHERS SO TH THE SPACERS MUST HAVE A A LOT OF USE,YEAH BECAUSE IT WAS SUCH A BIG DRAP LIKE FROM NINE THITEENT NINE THAT'S TEN WASHERS SO THE S SPACERS MUST AVE HAD A LOT OF UCE
9045,THEY'RE STICKING TOGETHER,THEY ARE STICKING TOGETHER
9046,I'M GOOD,I'M GOOD
9047,YEAH THEY'RE REALLY FUN ESPECIALLY THE MESSY ONES,YUH THEYRE REALLY FUN ESPECIALLY THE MESTIY ONES
9048,WE HAVE BEEN UM WE HAVE BEEN TESTING THE STRENGTH OF THE MAGNETS,WE HAVE BEEN UHM WE HAVE BEEN TESTING THE STRENGTH OF MAGNETS
9049,MAGNETS GET FURTHER APART BECAUSE THE MORE UM SPACERS YOU PUT IN BETWEEN THE UM LESS ROOM THEY HAVE,AGGENETS GET FURTHER AUPART BECAUSE THE MORE UHM SPACERS YOU PUT HIM BETWEEN THE UHMLESS ROOM THEY HAVE
9050,THEY SHOULD DO THE SAME THINGS,THEY SHOULD DO THE SAME THINGS
9051,WASHERS WERE HEAVY AND THEY MADE THE MAGNETS LOSE THEIR STRENGTH,EWATSHERS WERE HEAVY AND THEY MADE THE MAGNETS LEW THEIR STRENGTH
9052,YEAH BECAUSE THEN IT WOULD KIND OF UM HIT THE CUP AND THEN THE MAGNETS WOULD KIND OF SEPARATE BECAUSE OF THE FORCE AND THEN THEY WOULD COME BACK TOGETHER,YEAH BECAUSE THEN IT WOULD KIND OF UHM HIT THE CUP AND THEN THE MAGNETS WOUD KIND OF SEPORATE BECAUSE OF THE FORECSET AND THEN THEY OULD COME BACK TOGETHER
9053,IT'S BROKEN BECAUSE UM THE WASHER'S THROWN IN THERE SO HARD THAT IT KIND OF FORCES THAT CUP DOWN AND THE OTHER CUP TO COME WITH THE MAGNET TO SEPARATE FROM THE OTHER MAGNET,IT'S BROKEN BECAUSE UHM THE WASHER IS THROWN IN THEIRE SO HARD THAT IT KIND OF FORCES THAT CUP DOWN AND THE OTHER CUP TO COME WITH THE MAGNET TO SEPORATE FROM THE OTHER MAGNET
9054,THE MAGNETIC THE MAGNETS GET WEAKER AND WEAKER AS THE WASHERS GET AS THE MORE WASHERS GET IN THE OTHER CUP,THE MAGNETT THE MAGNETS GET WEAEKER AND WEAEKER AS THE WASHERS GET AS THE MORE WASHERS GET IN THE OTHER CUP
9055,C DIDN'T,SEETDED
9056,YOU NEED TO FOLLOW THE DIRECTIONS OR WHATEVER YOU'RE BEING TOLD TO DO CORRECTLY OR ELSE YOU'LL GET REALLY DIFFERENT RESULTS,YOU NEED TO FOLLOW THE DIRECTIONS OR WHATEVER YOU'R BEING TOLD TO DO CORECTLY OR ELSE YOU'LL GET REALLY DIFERENT RESOULTS
9057,IF YOU DON'T FOLLOW THE DIRECTIONS OR WHATEVER THEN YOU WON'T GET THE SAME RESULTS AS MAYBE THE OTHER PEOPLE WHO ARE DOING IT RIGHT,IF YOU DON'T FOLLOW THE DIRECTIONS OR WHATEVER THAN YOUW WON'T GET THE SAME RESULTS AS MAYBE THE OTHER PEOPLE WHO ARE DOING IT RIGHT
9058,I ANSWERED THAT ALREADY,I ANSWERE THAT ALREADY
9059,WELL THE THERE'S THE BASE THE WIRE THE C D CELL OR THE SOURCE AND THE LIGHT BULB THE RECEIVER AND THE WIRE THE PATHWAY,WILL THE THERES THE BASE THE WIRE THE DESALER HEURCE AND THE LIGHTBULLD THE IS VER AND THE WIRE THE PATHWAY

9292,THIS IS THE D CELL BATTERY,AIS THE DEECAIL BATERY
9293,WELL WHEN YOU DON'T HOOK IT UP RIGHT WITH THE WIRES AND THE BATTERY AND THE LIGHT BULBS,WELL WHEN YOU DON'T HOK IT UP RIGHT WITH THE WIRES AN THE BATERY IND THE LLBS
9294,YES,NES
9295,YEAH,I
9296,WELL THE ENERGY COMES FROM THIS SIDE INTO THE LIGHT BULB,WELLE THE ANARGY COMES FROM THIS SIDE INTO THE LIGHTBULB
9297,WELL WE WERE SUPPOSED TO USE ONE BUT OUR GROUP THOUGHT MAYBE TWO BATTERIES FOR TWO LIGHT BULBS BUT THAT DIDN'T REALLY WORK SO WE TOOK ONE D CELL,WELL WE WERE SPOSED TO USE ONE BUT OUR GROUP THOUGHT MAY BE TO BADERS FOR TWO LIFE BUBS BUT THAT DIDN'T REALLY WORK SO WE TOOK ONE DECI
9298,YEAH,N
9299,YES SOMETIMES,YES SOMETIMES
9300,YEAH,A
9301,PROBABLY RIGHT HERE,PROBABLY  RIGHT HERE
9302,YEAH KIND OF WE WERE LIKE UH MAYBE THIS ISN'T THE RIGHT WAY TO DO IT,YEAH KIND OF WE RELIC  MAYBE THIS I THE RIGHT WAY TO DO I
9303,AND THEN THIS CONNECTS TO THE SWITCH,AND THEN THIS CONEXTS TO THE SWITSH
9304,YEAH,YE
9305,THE SWITCH IS WORKING IT'S A CLOSED CIRCUIT WHEN THE SWITCH IS WORKING AND WHEN IT'S OPEN IT'S AN OPEN CIRCUIT AND OPEN CIRCUITS DON'T WORK SO WHEN YOU LIFT IT UP IT WON'T WORK CAUSE IT'S AN OPEN CIRCUIT,THE SWISCHIS WORKING IT'S A CLOSE CIRKET WHEN THE SWICH IS WORKING AND WHEN IT'S OPEN IT'S AN OPEN CIRCET AN HE OPEN SIRCAT SDILN'T WORK SO WHEN YO LIFT ET UP IT WON'T WORK CAUSE IT'S AN OPEN CIRC
9306,AND THIS HOOKS UP TO THE LIGHT BULB CHAMBER,NASIXS UP TO THE LIGHT BU CHAMER
9307,IT'S HERE AND THAT,SHERE IN THE OTHE  HHA H
9308,THAT'S A SWITCH AND THEN THESE ARE WHERE YOU CONNECT THE WIRES,THAT'S A SWISH AND THEN THESE ARE WAY TO CONECT THE WIRES
9309,I THINK SO MAYBE,I THINK SO MAYBE
9310,WELL,WELL
9311,OKAY,HOKA
9312,WELL,WELL
9313,AND WE PROBABLY TOUCHED THE SWITCH TO,OU OLD PROBABLY ATACH THE SWITCH TO
9314,WELL,WLL
9315,MOST OF THEM YEAH,MOST OF THEM YE
9316,HERE INTO THE OTHER,HERE INTO THE OTHER
9317,OKAY,T
9318,THAT HAVING TWO BATTERIES WOULD BE KIND OF HARDER SINCE YOU HAVE TWO LIGHT BULBS IT WOULD SEEM TO BE EASIER BUT BECAUSE WE HAVE TWO MORE ONE MORE TO H BATTERY TO HANDLE IT'S A LITTLE BIT HARDER,THAT HAVING TWO POTDERS WOULD BE KIND OF HARDTER SINCE YOU HAVE TWO LIHBLBSIT SEEME TO BE EASIER BUT BECAUSE WE HAVE TWO MORE ONE MORE DAY BATTER YGT TO HANDLE IT'S A LITTLEBIT HARDTER
9319,UM IT'S NOT CONNECTED SO THERE'S NO USUALLY A CIRCUIT WOULD GO LIKE THIS IT'S FULL,UM IT'S NOT CONECTED SO THERE'S NO USUALLY A CIRCUTE  GO LIKE THIS IT'S FUL
9320,AND IT GOES THROUGH,AND IT GOS THROUGH NE
9321,ENERGY AND THEN IT GOES OUT,ENOARGY AND THEN IT GOS OUT
9322,THIS IS THE POSITIVE SIDE AND THIS IS THE NEGATIVE SIDE,THIS IS THE POSITIVE SIDE AND THIS IS THE NIGITIVE SIDE
9323,YEAH MY TEACHER DID IT'S PARALLEL CIRCUITS WELL WE NOTICED THAT THE LIGHT BULB WHEN IT LIT UP IT WAS DULL SO PARALLEL CIRCUITS I THINK MAKE THEM LIGHT UP MORE,YE MY TEACHER DID IT'S PALOLE SIRCUTS WELLE WE NOTICED THAT THE LIGHTBUB WOULDN'T LIT UP IT WAS DULLE SO PALOLE CIRCUTE I THINK MAKE THEM LIGHT UP MORE
9324,WHEN YOU CONNECT IT TO THE LIGHT BULB I IT HAS TO CONNECT TO METAL TO METAL OR IT WON'T WORK,WHEN YOU CONNECT IT TO THE LIGHTBULD IT HAS TO CONECTT MEDDL TO MEDALE A IT WOLL WORK
9325,THAT PARALLEL CAN NEVER TOUCH,THAT PARILO CAN NEVER TAUCH
9326,THE SWITCH MAKES THEM TURN ON AND OFF SO MAYBE IF YOU GO UP OR DOWN YOU COULD ALWAYS COME BACK TO OFF OR ON OR,THISWICH MAKES THEM TURN ON AND OF SO MAYBE IF YOU GO UP OR DOWN YOU COULN ALWAYS COME BACK TO OFFOR ONHER
9327,NAH UH,UH
9328,SO THE LIGHT BULB CAN GET ALL OF IT'S,SO THE LIHBOB CAN GET ALL OF ITS
9329,BECAUSE IT WAS KIND OF TOO COMPLICATED TO DO IT WITH TWO CAUSE YOU HAD TO FIGURE OUT A SPECIAL WAY WHEN WITH ONE BATTERY YOU COULD DO A WHOLE BUNCH OF WAYS,BECAUSE IT WAS KIND OFS YOU COMPLICATED TO DO IT WITH TWOBECAUSE YOU HAD TO FIGURE OUT A SPECIAL WAY WHEN WITH ONE BADARYE COULD O CLUNTERPLAYS
9330,THE PA NEGATIVE SIDE OF THE BATTERY AND THEN THIS WOULD HAVE THE POSITIVE SIDE,THE PE NIGID IF SIDE OF THE BATTER AND THEN THIS WOULD HAVE THE POSITIVE SIE
9331,YEAH,ER
9332,MMM HMM YAY,SA
9333,YEAH,YEH
9334,YEAH,TA
9335,SHE COULD PUT ANOTHER BULB IN,SHE COULD PUT ANOTHER BULL BIN
9336,THE LIGHT BULB DOES NOT LIGHT UP,THE LIGHPEL DOES NOT WIGHTE UP
9337,YEAH,YEA
9338,ONLY ONE UH A BROTHER HE'S IN COLLEGE NOW THOUGH,ONLY ONE U A BROTHER HE'S INA COLLAGE NOW THOUGH
9339,A PARALLEL CIRCUIT IS WHEN THEY NEVER TOUCH SO IF ONE BULB GOES OUT IT'LL JUST BE OUT AND ALL THE OTHERS WILL JUST KEEP GOING BECAUSE WELL IT'S ITS OWN LITTLE CIRCUIT KIND OF,A PARLOILE CIRKUTE IS WHEN THEY NEVER TOUTCH SO IF ONE BOLB GOES OUT IT 'LL JUST BE OUT AND ALL THE OTHER S WE'L JUST KEEP GOING BECAUSE WELL ITS IT'S ON LITTLE CIRCKUETE KIND OF
9340,AN OPEN CIRCUIT IS WHEN UM IS WHEN MAYBE IF YOU HAVE A SWITCH IN A SERIES CIRCUIT AND YOU LIFT IT UP IT BECOMES AN OPEN CIRCUIT AND NOTHING HAPPENS,AN OPEN SCIRKET IS WHEN UHMI'S WHEN MAYBE IF YOU HAVE A SWICH IN A SERIS CIRCKETE AND YOU LIFT IT UP IT BECOMES AN OPEN SCIRCKETE AND NOTHING HAPPENS
9341,WELL IT IT STOPS THE WHOLE LIGHT FROM BEING LIGHTED CAUSE IT MAKES AN OPEN CIRCUIT,WELL IT IT STOPS THE HOLE LIGHTS FROM BEING LIGHTED  CAUSE IT MAKES AN OPEN CIRCKET
9342,PARALLEL,PURLO
9343,I THINK IT WOULD GO OUT,I THINK IT WOULD GO OUT
9344,MMM HMM YEAH,YEA
9345,YES YEAH,YES LA OYE
9346,ACTUALLY THAT ONE WOULD PROBABLY WELL,ACTUALLY THAT ONE WOULD PROBABLY WEL
9347,OKAY,HER

9349,HELLO NO YEAH,OL HEL NO  S  AH
9350,SO IT WOULD COME OUT HERE AND THEN GO THROUGH HERE AND THEN COME HERE AND THEN COME THROUGH HERE EXCEPT THERE PROBABLY WOULDN'T BE ENOUGH LEFT AFTER IT WENT THROUGH OVER HERE,SO IT OULD COME OUT HERE THEN GO THROUGH HERE AND THEN COME HERE AND THEN COME THROUGH HERE EXCEPT THEYRE PROBABLY WOULDN'T BE ENOUGH LEFT AFTER IT WENT  THREE OVER HERE
9351,UM THEY ALL STOPPED,UHM THEY ALL STOPED
9352,THOSE LIGHTS ARE BRIGHT E THEY'RE BRIGHTER THAN THE SERIES AND I THINK IT'S BECAUSE THEY DON'T TAKE EACH OTHER'S ELECTRICITY,THOSE LIGHTS ARE BRIGHT THE'RE BRIGHTER THAN THE SERIES AND I THINK IT'S BECAUSE THEY DON'T TAKE EACH OTHER'S ELECTRISCITY
9353,YEP,YEA
9354,SURE,HA
9355,THE BULB WOULD JUST STAY LIGHT,THE BULB WOULD JUST STAY LIT
9356,THE NO,THE
9357,IT HAD WAY TOO MUCH ELECTRICITY AND THEN AND THEN WHEN YOU REACHED THREE IT'LL JUST BLOW UP THE LIGHT BULB,IT HAT WAGS TOO MUCH O LCTRISCITY AND THEN AND THEN WHEN HE REACHD THREE IT 'LL JUST BUP DE LIHT OLB
9358,AND IT NEVER IT NEVER REALLY ACTUALLY ATTACHES WIRES TO THE OTHER LIGHT BULB,AND IT NEVER AND NEVER REALLY ACTUALLY ATACHS WIERES TO THE OTHER LIHBEL
9359,WELL IT WOULD CREATE THE ELECTRICITY TO GO STRAIGHT THROUGH,WEN I'LD CREATE THE LCTRISCITY TO GO STRAGHT THROUGH
9360,WELL THE LIGHTS AT FIRST THEY WOULD GO ON THEN WHEN A FILAMENT WOULD BREAK IT WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO ALL OPEN,WELL THE LIGHTS AT FIRST THEY WOULD GO ON WHEN WHEN A FIDLEMENT WOULD BREAK IT WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO ALL OPEN
9361,AND THEN THIS ONE WOULD TAKE SOME OF THE ELECTRICITY AND THEN GO LIKE THIS,AND THEN THIS ONE WOULD TAKE SOME OF THE LLECTRISITY AND THEN GO LIKE THIS
9362,YEAH OUR TEACHER TOLD US TO DO THAT BUT WE DIDN'T REALLY GET THE WHOLE THING I YEAH HOW DO WE WER THE PEOPLE THAT WERE MAKING A PARALLEL DIDN'T KNOW EXACTLY HOW TO DO THAT,YE OUR TEACHER TOLD US TO DO THAT BUT WE DIDN'T EALLY GET THE WHOLE THING I YE HOW DO WE WE THE PEOPLE THAT WERE MAKING A PARLLALL DIDN'T KNOW EXACTLY HOW TO DO THA
9363,AFTERNOON,AFTERNOON
9364,UM WELL OF COURSE THE LIGHT BULB IS PROBABLY LIGHTING UP MOST LIKELY OF COURSE AND WELL,M WELL OF COURSE THE LIHEBIL IS PROBABLY LIGHTING UP MOST LIKELY OF COURSE AND WELL
9365,YEAH I THINK IT WOULD BE LIKE MAYBE ONE CIRCUIT AND THEN THE OTHER CIRCUIT BUT,YEH I THINK IT WOULD BE LIKE MAYBE ONE CIRCUTE AND THEN THE OTHER CIRCUT BU
9366,YEAH,YEH
9367,YEAH,YEH
9368,AND THEN GO BACK INTO THE LIGHT BULB TO MAKE IT GO OUT,AND THEN GO BACK INTO THE LIBOB TO MAKE OU GO OU
9369,CAUSE THEY NEVER TOUCH,CAUSE THEY NEVER TUCH
9370,ELECTRICITY,ELECTRISCITY
9371,BECAUSE IT'S AN OPEN CIRCUIT AND UM IT'S NOT ATTACHING T WELL IT'S NOT METAL TO METAL IN,BECAUSE IT'S AN OPEN CIRCTE AN UHM IT'S NOT ATATCHING  WELL IT'S NOT MEDL TO MEDDAL AND

9379,UM THERE'S JUST NOT ENOUGH ELECTRICITY TO CREATE UH ENOUGH FOR TWO,UHM THERE'S JUST NO ENOUGH LECTRISCITY TO CREATE A ENOUGH FOR TWO
9380,WELL WHEN YOU HAVE A LIGHT BULB LIKE THIS ONE I GUESS IT WOULD BE LI UM THE LIGHT BULB WOULD,THOUGH WHEN YOU HAD A LIPL LIKE THIS MON I GUESS IT WOULD BE TH UHM THE LIGHTBU WOULD
9381,THAT'S IS S S THE BATTERY D CELL,THAT'S IS THE BATTERY DEECALL
9382,WELL OKAY SO THIS WOULD BE THE PA THIS WOULD BE THE POSITIVE SIDE AND THEN SO IT WOULD GO THROUGH AND THEN INTO THE LIGHT BULB AND THEN OUT BACK,WELL I SO THIS WOULD BE THE PO THIS WOULD BE THE POSITIE SIDE AND THEN SO IT OULD GO THROUGH THEN INTO THE LIGHT BB AND THEN OUT BACK
9383,YEAH,
9384,IT'S ALL STOPPING AND STAYING,IT'S ALL STOPPING AND STAY
9385,YEAH WELL IT WOULD PROBABLY BE BRIGHTER OR THE SAME BECAUSE IT'S IT'S OWN LITTLE CIRCUIT SO IT WOULDN'T REALLY,YE WELL IT WOULD PROBABLY BE BRIGHTER OR THE SAME BECAUSE IT'S ITS AL LITTLE CIRCKUT SO IT WOULDN'T REALLY

9535,NO NOT REALLY,NO NOT REALLY
9536,AND WE'RE LEARNING ABOUT LIKE THE BASE THE FULCRUM AND THE BALANCE,AND WERE LEARNING ABOUT LIKE THE BASE THE FULCRUMB IN THE BALLONCE
9537,NO WE HAVEN'T,NOWIHAM
9538,YEAH THIS IS LIKE EXACTLY WHAT WE USE,YE THIS IS LIKE EXACTLY WHAT WE USE
9539,YEAH,YEH
9540,OH YEAH AND UM IT'S JUST BECAUSE IF IT'S LIKE WAY DOWN HERE YOU WOULDN'T GUESS LIKE ONE GRAM BECAUSE HOW COULD THAT BE POSSIBLE,OH YE AND UHM IT'S JUST BECAUSE IF IT'S LIKE WAY DOWN HERE YOU WOULDN'T GUESS LIKE ONE GRAM BECAUSE HOW COULD THAT BE POSSIBLE

9544,PARTICLE SIZE AND MAGNETISM,PARTICLE SIZE AN MAGNETIZOM
9545,THE IMPORTANT PROPERTY IS MAGNETISM,THE IMPORTANT PROPRTY IS MAGNETIZO
9546,I SAW THAT THE SAND I THINK WENT STAYED ON THE TOP OF THE FILTER WHEN THE WATER AND SALT WENT THROUGH,I SAW THAT THE SAND I THINK WEN STAYED ON THE TOP OF THE FOTIL WHEN THE WATER AND THE SALT WENT THROUGH

9549,THE THE PAPER CLIPS ARE GOING TO THE MAGNET BECAUSE THEY HAVE MAGNETISM,THE MA THE PAPER CLIPS ARE GOING TO THE MAGNET BECAUSE THEY HAVE MAGNETIS
9550,I NOTICED THAT NONE OF THE OTHER THINGS WOULD GO WITH THE MAGNET,I NOTICE THAT NONE OF THE OTHER THINGS WOULD GO WITH THE MAGNE
9551,BECAUSE THE STONES ARE BIGGER THAN THEIR PARTICLE SIZE IS BIGGER THAN THE HOLES IN THE SEAM THING WHATEVER YOU SAID,BECAUSE THE STONES ARE BIGGER THN THE THEY ARE PARTICALE SIZE IS BIGER THAN THE HOLES IN THE UHM SEM THNG WHATEVER YOU SAID Y
9552,WE CAN SEPARATE MIXTURES BY USING MAGNETS FILTERS AND EVAPORATION,WE CAN SEPERATE MICTURES BY USING MAGNETS FITES AND VABERATTO
9553,THINK WE USED UM A DIFFERENT THING BECAUSE THERE ARE PAPER CLIPS WHICH HAVE MAGNETITE IN THEM SO THEY WOULD GO WITH THE MAGNET INSTEAD OF JUST STAYING WITH OTHERS,I THINK WE USED UHM A DIFERENT THING BECAUSE THERE ARE PAPER CLIPS WHICH HAVE MAGNETITE IN THEM SO THEY WOULD GO WITH THE MAGNET INSTEAD OF JUST STAYING WITH UTLR
9554,DON'T GO MARNI BYE,DON'T GO  HARDY BA
9555,I DIDN'T NOTICE ANYTHING ELSE BUT I BUT I THINK WE USE THE FILTER BECAUSE THE STUFF STAYED ON TOP,I DIDN'T NOTICE ANYTHING ELSE BUT I BUT I THINK WE USED THE FILTER BECAUSE THE STUFF STAYED ON THE
9556,IT IS A SOLUTION,IT IS A SILUTION
9557,I NOTICED THAT THE SIEVE STAYED ON TOP OF THE UM THE FILTER WHEN THE OTHERS THINGS WENT DOWN,I NOTICED THAT THE SEEDS STAYED ON TOP OF THE S UHM THE FITILE WHEN THE OTHERS THINGS WENT DO
9558,NO,NO
9559,SURE IT TWO TWO THINGS THAT KEEP THEIR PROPERTY,SURE IS TO TWO THINGS MIXED TOGETHER THAT KEEP THEIR PROPE
9560,THE ROCKS ARE STAYING ON TOP BECAUSE UM BECAUSE UM THEIR PARTICLE SIZE IS BIGGER THAN THE HOLE,THE ROCKS ARE STAYING ON TOP BECAUSE UHM BECAUSE UHM THEY ARE PARTICLE SIZE S BIGE THAN THE WHOLE
9561,YES,YES
9562,WE BEEN TALKING ABOUT MIXTURES AND SOLUTIONS,WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT MIXTRES IN SAILLUTION
9563,DIFFERENT UM WE USE DIFFERENT TOOLS FOR DIFFERENT MIXTURES BECAUSE EACH MIXTURE HAS DIFFERENT THINGS THAT HAVE DIFFERENT PROPERTIES,DIFFEFERENT UHM WE USE DIFFERENT TOLES FOR DIFEREN MIXTURES BECAUSE EACH MIXTURE HAS DIFFERENT THINGS THAT HAVE DIFERENT PROPRTY
9564,PROPERTY THAT'S BEING SHOWN IS PARTICLE SIZE,PROPRTY THAT'S BEING SHOWN ISA PARTICLE A S
9565,I NOTICED THAT THE PAPER CLIPS WENT WITH THE MAGNET BECAUSE THEY HAVE MAGNETITE IN THEM,I NOTICE THAT THE PAPER CLIPS SWIT WITH THE MAGMENT BECAUSE THEY HAVE MAGMATIGHTEEN
9566,OKAY,OK
9567,THE ONE I PICKED WAS THE SALT BECAUSE IT'S BEST FOR EVAPORATING TO MAKE SALT CRYSTALS,WHEN I PICKED WAS THESAULT BECAUSE IT'S BESTFUL OF VAPRRATING TO MAKE SALT CHRISTALS
9568,THAT MEANS WELL MAKING THE WATER NOT UM GO UM WELL IT'S JUST MAKING THE WATER DISAPPEAR TO MAKE THE SALT COME,THAT MEANS WELL MAKING THE WATER NOT UHM GO UHM WELL IT'S JUST MAKING THE WATER DISAPPEAR TO MAKE THE SALT COME
9569,BECAUSE THEY HAVE DIFFERENT DENSITY STUFF,ECAUSE THEY HAVE DIFFERENT THEIR CITIES TO

9574,UM IT'S ABOUT THE LIMITS ABOUT HOW MUCH YOU CAN HOLD STUFF,UHM IT'S ABOUT THE LIMITS ABOUT HOW MUCH YOU CAN HOLD STUFF
9575,I THINK THAT THEY'RE ADDING ENOUGH SALT TO MAKE THE WATER REACH THE LIMIT ABOUT HOW MUCH SALT IT CAN HOLD,I THINK THAT THE'RE ADDINGS ENOUGH SALLT AN MAKE THE WATER REACH THE LIMIT ABOUT HOW MUCH SALT IT CAN WHOLE
9576,UM THE WATER CAN HOLD FOUR SCOOPS OF CITRIC ACID BUT ONLY THREE SCOOPS OF EPSOM SALT,UHM THE WATER CAN HOLD FULL SKOPS OF SIQRID SICHID AS IT ASAD BUT ONLY F THREE  SKOPS OF EAO SOL
9577,THEY'RE REACHING THEIR LIMITS OF HOW MUCH THEY CAN HOLD IN THE WATER,THEY ARE REACHING THEYAR LIMITSOME HOW MHUCH THEY CAN HOLD IN THE WATER

9610,BECAUSE YOU DIDN'T ADD AS MUCH SOLUTE THAT YOU DID TO THE SOLVENT SO THEY'RE LESS THEY'RE MORE DILUTED THEY ARE DILUTED,BECAUSE YOUDN'T AD  MUCH SOL YOU THAT YOU DID TO THE SEULVENT SO THEM LESS THEYRE MORE DELUDI THEY ARE DELUDE

9620,WE LEARNED ABOUT SATURATION,O THAT'SNIGHT WE LEARNED ABOUT SACHUATIONN
9621,YOU CAN SAY THAT IT'S MORE CONTRASTED,OO CAN SAY THAT I SMALLE CONTRASTED
9622,SO SOLUTION A IS MORE DENSE THAN SOLUTION B BECAUSE THE GRAM WENT TO THE BOTTOM AND THEN THE B WENT TO THE TOP,SO SILOTION A IS MORE ANE THAN SILOOTION BE BECAUSE THE GRAM WENT TO THE BOTOM AND THE AN BE WEN TO THE DOL
9623,IT JUST STAYS AT THE TOP,IT JUST STAYES AT THE D
9624,IT SAYS THAT THE BLUE IS TWELVE GRAMS WHEN THE GREEN IS TWO GRAMS SO IT HAS TEN MORE GRAMS THAN IT,IT SAS THAT THE BLUE IS TWELVE GRANS WHEN THE GRAYN AS TGRAN SO IT HAS TENMORE GRAS THEN
9625,BECAUSE THE THE HEAVIER ONE SUNK TO THE BOTTOM AND MIXED IN WITH THE LIGHTER ONE,BECAUSE THE THE HEAVER ONE SUNK TO THE BOTTOM AND MIXED IN WITH A LGHTELE ONE
9626,ONE THE LESS DENSE ONE GOES STAYS TO THE TOP THE ONE THAT I'VE ALREADY DONE THAT THE ONE THAT'S MORE DENSE WILL,ONE HE LESTINE ONE GOS STAYSE TO THE TOP THE ONE THAT I'VE ARADY DO THAT THE ONE THAT'S MOR DENCE WELL
9627,THEY ARE BEING SEPARATED CAUSE OF THEIR DENSITY,THEY ARE BEING SCEPORATED CAUSE OF THEIR DENCITY
9628,I THINK THIS MEANS THAT SOLUTION A IS MORE DENSE THAN SOLUTION B,I THINK THIS MEANS THAT SUILOUTION A IS MORE DINC THAN TO SUILOUTION BE
9629,THEIR DENSITY CAME THE THEIR DENSITY BECAME THE SAME,THEY DENCITYCAMETETHEYDENCITY BECAME THE SAME
9630,THEY HAVE MORE OF THE SOLUTE IN THEM SO THEY ARE MORE CONTRASTED OR MORE DENSE,THEY HAVE MORE OF THE SULLUTE IN THEM SO THEY ARE MORE CONTREASTED LILE MORE DANCE
9631,WELL WHEN YOU MIX TWO SOLUTION SALT SOLUTIONS TOGETHER ONE THAT THE ONE THAT'S MORE DENSE WILL SINK TO THE BOTTOM AND THE ONE THAT'S LESS DENSE WILL GO TO THE TOP FLOAT,WUT WHEN YOU MIXE TWO SILUI SAL SILLATIONS TOGETHER ONE THA THE ONE THAT'S MORE DENCE IL SINK TO THE BOTTOM AND THEN ONE THAT'S MO LES DANS WELL GO TO THE TOP FLUTE
9632,BAD,DAD
9633,IN SOLUTION THEY WOULD SINK AND IN SOLUTION B THEY WOULD FLOAT,IN ESTILLTION A THEY WOULD SINK AN INSTLAUTION BE THEY WOULD FOT

10109,GOOD,GED
10110,THEN THE OTHER LIGHT BULB WOULD GET BRIGHTER IF IT WAS A SERIES NO A PARALLEL BUT IF IT WAS A SERIES BOTH OF THEM WOULD GO OUT,THEN THE OTHER LIBEL WOULD GET BRIGHTER EFPOS TA SER NO A PARILO BUT IF IT WAS A SERIEUSE BOTH OF THEM WOULD GO OUT
10111,WELL IT ALSO STARTS FROM COMING OUT THE NEGATIVE AND THEN IT GOES THROUGH THE POSITIVE AGAIN AND THEN COMES OUT THE NEGATIVE ON BOTH ENDS IT MAKES THE CIRCUIT,WELL IT ALSO STARTS FROM COMING OUT THE NIGIVE AND THEN IT GOS THROUGH THE POSITEI EGIN AND THENT COMES OUT THE NIGIETIVE ON BOTH AND IT MAKES THE CIRCUT
10112,IF IF NOT A PARALLEL CIRCUIT THAT MEANS THAT THERE IS ONLY ONE CIRCUIT AND IT HAS TO BE AN OP CLOSED CIRCUIT,IF ITS NOT A PARLO CIRCUT THAT MEANS THAT THERE IS ONLY ONE CIRCUT AND I HAS TO BE AN  CLOSE CIRCUT
10113,THAT UM IF THE OP THE CIRCUIT WAS OPEN THEN THE LIGHT WOULDN'T WORK,THAT UHM IF THE OP THE CIRKET WAS OPENE THEN THE LIGHT WOULDN'T WORK
10114,BECAUSE IF THERE'S MORE OF WIRES IT WILL MAKE THE LIGHT STRONGER,BECAUSE IF THERE'S MOREWIRES IT WILL MAKE THE LIGHT STRONGER
10115,WE HAVE BEEN TRYING TO LIGHT TWO PARALLEL CIRCUITS,WE HAVE BEEN TRYING TO LIGHT TWO PARLO CIRKUTS
10116,IT'S A CLOSED CIRCUIT AND THE THE ENERGY IS GOING THROUGH THE LIGHT BULBS AND INTO THE BATTERY,IT'S A CLOSE CIRCKET AND THE THAT ENARGY IS GOING THROUGH THE LIFBULBS IND INTO THE BATORY
10117,ONE CIRCUIT IS GOING TO THE LEFT AND THE OTHER ONE IS GOING TO THE RIGHT AND THE D CELL IS SPLITTING UP IT'S POWER,ONE CIRCKET IS GOING TO THE LEFT AND THE OTHER ONE IS GOING TO THE RAIGHT AND THE DAYCELL IS SPLITING UP ITS POWER

10127,GOOD,GOOD
10128,UM IT PARALLEL CIRCUITS ARE IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT WILL GIVE YOU MORE LIGHT AND UM IT'LL S GIVE YOU MORE ELECTRICITY,PUHM IT PARLO CIRCKUTS ARE IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT WILL GIVE YOU MORE LIGHT AND UHM ELS GIVE YOU MORE ELLECTRICITY
10129,I THINK IT'S A PARALLEL CIRCUIT BECAUSE THERE ARE TWO OR MORE PATHS,I THINK IT'S A PARLO CIRCKET BECAUSE THERE ARE TWO OR MORE PATHS
10130,OKAY,OK
10131,BYE,I
10132,BECAUSE IT LIGHTS UP MORE THAN TWO LIGHT BULBS AND IT PROVIDES MORE LIGHT,BECAUSE IT LIGHTS UP MORE THAN TWO LIGHBLBS THAN IT PROVIDES MORE LIGHT
10133,THAT THE ENERGY GOES THROUGH THE LIGHT BULB AND GOES AND MAKES LIGHT,THAT THE ENARGY GOES THROUGH THE LIBOB AN  GOES ND MAKE FLAT

10977,YEAH CAUSE UM WATER HAS A LOT AND A LOT OF MASS SO DO OTHER LIQUIDS YEAH,YE CAUSE UHM WATER HAS A LAW IN A LAW F MAS SO DO OTHER LIQUIDS YEAH
10978,NO NO NOT REALLY GRAMS NO I DON'T,NOW NO NOT REALLY GRAYM'S KNOW I DON'T
10979,YEAH,JE
10980,UM WHAT DID YOU MEAN,UHM WHAT DOID YOU MEAN
10981,UM THE MOTOR IS SPINNING UM BECAUSE THE ELECTRICITY IS CREATING THE MOTOR TO SPIN,UHM THE MOTOR IS SPINING UHM BECAUSE THE LECTRICITY IS CREATING THE MOATOROTO SPIN
10982,MUST BE GOING THROUGH ME UM ELECTRICITY MUST BE FLOWING THE UH MOTOR AND COMING OUT THE MOTOR IN ORDER FOR THE MOTOR TO TURN,MUST BE GOING THROUGH ME UM ELLECTRISCITY MUST BE FLOWING THROUGH THE A MOATOR AND COMING OUT THE MOATOR IN ORDER TO FUR THE MOATOR TO TURN
10983,MAKES THE MOTOR WORK,EXTE ATER WORK
10984,IT'S CREATING THE IT'S MOVING AROUND,ITS CREATING THE ITS MOVING AROUND
10985,IS RUNNING,S RUNNIN
10986,IT HAS TO HAVE ELECTRICITY,IT HAS TO HAVE A LECTURICITY
10987,THE MOTOR IS MOVING,THE MOTORI'S MOVING
10988,IT CAN SAVE ENERGY,IT CAN SAVE ANARGY
10989,IT DOES NOT WORK BECAUSE THERE IS NO SUNLIGHT TO MAKE ELECTRICITY FROM,IT DOES NOT WORK BECAUSE THEREI'S NO LLECTRIU SUNLIGHT TO MAKE E LECTRISITY FRUM
10990,THE SWITCH IS OFF I MEAN ON,THE SWITSH IS OF I MAN ON
10991,THE IT SORT OF LIKE MAKES LIKE A JAGGED PIECE THAT THE ELECTRICITY CAN'T GO ANYWHERE,TH IT SORT OF LIKE MAKES A JAGET PICE IT THE LCTOR CITY CAN'T GO ANYWHER
10992,UH LOOKS LIKE IT'S A CIRCUIT WITH A SWITCH ON IT,I LOOKS LIKE IT'S A CIRCETE WITH A SWITSH ON IT
10993,IT DOES NOT MOVE WHICH SHOWS THAT THERE IS NO ELECTRICITY GOING FROM IT AND OUT OF IT,IT DOES NOT MOVE BHUT SHOWS THAT THERE'S NO LLECTRISCITY GOING FROM IT AND OUT OF I
10994,ENERGY GOING INTO THE MOTOR AND OUT OF THE MOTOR,HE IS GOING INTO THE MORDER AND OUT OF THE MOADER
10995,VERY I'M NOT HAVING A VERY GOOD DAY TODAY,VERY I'M NOT HAVEING A VERY GOOD DAY TODAY
10996,YOU MUST HAVE ENERGY GO THROUGH THE WIRES AND COME OUT THE WIRES,YOU MUST HAVE ENEARGY GO THOUGH THE WIRES AND COME OUT THE WIR
10997,WELL WE'VE BEEN STUDYING ENERGY AND ELECTROMAGNETISM,WELLE WE'VE BEEN SETTING ELECTTO THE ENARGY N ALECTROA MAGNTIZOM
10998,IT WOULD NOT WORK UM BECAUSE THERE IS NO SUNLIGHT FOR UM IT TO MAKE ELECTRICITY FROM,IT WOULD NOT WORK BECAUSE UHM THERE'S NO SUNLIGHT FOR UHM IT TO MAKE ALECTURISCITY FROM
10999,THE SWITCH HAS TO BE CLOSED,THIS WICH HAS TO BE CLOTHED
11000,TAKE THE SUNS RAYS AND TURN IT INTO ELECTRICITY,AK THE STUNS RAZE AND TURN IT INTO LECTURIS ITY
11001,I NOTICE THAT WHEN YOU OPEN IT IT DOESN'T WORK AND WHEN YOU CLOSE IT IT DOES WORK,I NOTICE THAT WHENF YOU OPEN IT IT DOESN'T WORK AND WHEN YOU CLOSE IT IT DOES WORK
11002,IT MAKES THE MOTOR MOVE AND IT MAKES THE GEARS INSIDE THE MOTOR TURN WHICH MAKES THE SHAFT ROTATE,IT MAKES THE MOATOR MOVE AND IT MAKES THE GEARS INSIDE THE MOATOR TURN WHICH MAKES THE SHAFT ROTATE
11003,NO,NO
11004,THANK YOU SO MUCH,THANK YOU SO
11005,IT UH IT CAN NOT COMPLETE A FULL CIRCUIT,IT DE EL IT DOESN'T IT CANNOT COMPLEAT A FULL CIRCUT
11006,THERE IS NO ELECTRICITY IN THE CIRCUIT POWER THE MOTOR,THEREIS NO LECTISCITY IN THE CIRCUT POWER THE MOTOR
11007,UM THE SOLAR PANEL IS TAKING IN THE SUN RAYS AND TURNING IT INTO ELECTRICITY TO POWER THE MOTOR,UHM THE SOULER PANAL IS TAKENG IN THE SUN RAISE AND TURNING ITO LECTICITY TO POWER THE MOATOR
11008,BYE BYE MARNEY,BYBYE MORNING
11009,ONE OR TWO,ONE OR TWO
11010,THEY'RE FORCING ENERGY TO GO BOTH WAYS WHEN THE POSITIVE SIDE IS ON WHEN THE NEGATIVE AND NEGATIVE ARE TOGETHER,THE'RE FORCING ANARGY TO GO BOTH WAYS WHEN THE POUSITIVE SIDE IS ON WHEN UHM THE NEGATIVE AND NEGATIVE ARE UHM TOGETHER
11011,I'M NOT VERY GOOD,I'M NOT VERY GOOD
11012,IT SHOWS THAT ELECTRICITY IS FLOWING THROUGH,IT SHOWS THAT ELLECTRICITYS FLOWING THROUGH
11013,THE WRONG SIDES WERE CONNECTED THE NEGATIVE AND NEGATIVE WERE CONNECTED TO EACH OTHER,THE WRONG SIDES WERE CONECTED THE NEGTIVE ANDNEGTIVE WERE CONECTED TO EACH OTHER
11014,THAT IT PRODUCES LIGHT OR,THAT IT PRODUCES LIGHT OR MO
11015,THEY WILL HAVE MORE ENERGY SO THEY WILL GLOW EVEN BRIGHTER,THEY WILL HAVE MORE ENARGEYES SO THEY WIL GLOW EVEN GREATE
11016,ENERGY IS TRAVELING THROUGH THE LIGHT BULB INTO THE,ENEARGY IS TRAVELING THROUGH THE THU LIGHTBALL INTO THE BIT B
11017,POSITIVE AND THE BOTH OF THE POSITIVE SIDES ON BOTH D CELLS ARE TOUCHING EACH OTHER,POSITIVE AND THE  BOTH OF THE POSITIVE SIDES ON BOTH THESESELVES ARE TOUTCHING EACH OTHER
11018,I CAN SEE ALL THE LIKE LITTLE MOLECULES OF ENERGY FLOWING THROUGH THEM AND THE EVIDENCE IS YOU CAN SEE THE LIGHT,I CAN SEE AL THE IKE LITTLE MAIKEES OF ENARGY FLOWING THOUGH THEM AND THE EVIENCE IS YOU CAN SEE THE LIGHT
11019,THEY BURN OUT FASTER,THEY BURN OUT FASTER
11020,IN SERIES CIRCUITS YOU HAVE TWO BATTERIES USUALLY AND TWO LIGHT BULBS AND IT CAN COMPLETE A FULL CIRCUIT AND IT WILL PRODUCE,IT SER CIRCUTS YOU HAVE A TWO BADERES USULLY INTO LIGHT BULBS AND IT CAN COMPLEET A FALL CIRKET AND IT WILL PREDUCE UHM A LOT OF
11021,IT IS FLOWING IN A PATHWAY TO CREATE A CIRCUIT,IT IS FLOWING UHM IN A U PATHWAY UHM TO CREATE A CIRCUT
11022,THEY DON'T WORK BECAUSE NO ENERGY CAN COME OUT OF THEM IT'S JUST THE ENERGY'S RUNNING INTO EACH OTHER,THEY DON'T WORK BECAUSE NO ENEARGY CAN COME OUT OF THEM THE IT'S JUST THE ENEARGY IS RUNNING INTO EACH OTHER
11023,IT IS FLOWING THROUGH THE LIGHT BULBS,IT IS FLOWING THROUGH THE LIGHT BULBS
11024,THE CIRCUIT IS CREATING A PATHWAY FOR THE ENERGY TO FLOW THROUGH THE CIRCUIT,THE CIRCET IS CREATING A PATHWAY FOR THE ENARGY TO FLOW THROUGH THE CIRICUT
11025,THE LIGHT BULBS GLOWED BRIGHTER,UHM THE LIGHT BUBS  UHM GOOD BRITER
11026,IT HAS TO GO THROUGH THE LIGHT BULB,IT HAS TO GO THROUGH THE LIGHT BULM
11027,IT FLOWS THROUGH THE CIRCUIT TO CREATE ENERGY I MEAN TO CREATE A SOURCE OF LIGHT POWER OR MOVEMENT,IT FLOWS THROUGH THE CIRCET TO CREATE ENARGY A MAN TO CREATE A SOURCE OF LIGHT POWER OR MOVEMENT
11028,THE PATHWAY THAT THEY MAKE,THE UM PATHWAY THAT THEY MAY
11029,IT FLOWS AROUND A CIRCUIT I MEAN IT FLOWS LIKE IN A CIRCLE IN A TO CREATE PATHWAYS IN THE,IT FLOWS AROUND A CIRCT I MEAN IT FLOWS LIKE IN A UHM CIRCLE IN A TO CREAATE PATHWAYS IN THE CEIR
11030,IT HAS TO FLOW THROUGH ONE LIGHT BULB AND THEN OUT AND THEN INTO ANOTHER LIGHT BULB AND THEN INTO THE POSITIVE SIDE AND THEN OUT TO THE NEGATIVE SIDE,IT HAS TO BLOW THROUGH ONE LIGHT BUB AND THEN OUT AND THEN E INTO ANOTHER LIHE BUB AND THEN INTO THE POSITIV SID ND THEN OUT OF THE NEGETIVE SIDE
11031,THE NEGATIVE SIDE OF THE D CELL BATTERY,THE NEGETIVE SIDE OF THE DEESAILL BAT
11032,THE BATTERIES CONTAIN ENERGY UM THAT UM RUNS THROUGH THE WIRES UM THAT POWERS THE LIGHT BULB,SO THE BATERES CONTAIN ENARGY UHM THAT UHM RUNS THOUGH THE A WIRES UHM THAT POWERS DELIGHT FUL
11033,IT'S ALSO UM WHAT MAKES IT WHAT'S A LIGHT BULB IS THE THING THAT PRODUCES LIGHT WITH THE ENERGY THAT THE D CELL BATTERY USES,IT'S ALL SO UHM WHAT MAKES IT WHAT'S ALIBULLBIS THE THING THAT PORDUCEES LIGHT WITH THE ENARGY THAT THE DESAW BETTER H COME USES
11034,IT MEANS TO ME THAT WE CAN SEE THINGS AND THAT IT'S LIKE LITTLE RADIO WAVES GOING THROUGH THE BATTERY AND INTO THE LIGHT BULB,IT MEENS ME THAT WE CAN SEE THINGS AND THAT IT'S LIKE LITTLE RADIA WAVES GOING THROUGH THE BADERY ND INTO HELIFE
11035,THERE'S ONE THE POSITIVE SIDE HAS A LITTLE NUB ON IT AND THE NEGATIVE SIDE IS FLAT,THEREIS ONE THE POSITIVE SIZE HAS A LITTLE NUB ON IT AND THE NEGETIVE SIDE IS FLAT
11036,I AM SO GOOD,I AM SO GOOD
11037,IT BASICALLY A LIGHT BULB EXCEPT IT'S JUST A SCIENTIFIC WORD FOR IT,IT BASICALY MEANS A LIGHT BALL B EXCEPT AS JUST A SIENTIFIC WORLD FOR IT
11038,THAT IT WILL GIVE ENERGY,THAT IT WILL GIVE ENEARGY
11039,IT IS FLOWING UPWARD TOWARD THE LIGHT BULB,IT IS FLOWING UPWARD TOWARDS THE LIGHTBUB
11040,WIRES A D CELL BATTERY AND A LIGHT BULB,WIRES A DEETAIL BATTERY AND A LIGHTBUL
11041,WELL WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT ENERGY AND ABOUT ELECTROMAGNETISM,WELL WE'E BEEN LEARNING ABOUT ENARGY AND ALETURO MA ALETURO MAG MAGNETIZOM
11042,YOU TAKE THE ELECTRICITY FROM THE BATTERY AND THEY MAKE IT COME THE ELECTRICITY COMES THROUGH THE WIRES AND IT POWERS THE LIGHT BULB,IT TAKE THE ELLECTRISCITY FROM THE BATERY AND THEY MAKE IT COM THE LECTRITRISITY COMES THROUGH THE WIERES AND IT POWERES DELIGHEL
11043,IT FLOWS IT GOES AROUND IN A CIRCLE,IT FLOWS IT GOS AROUND IN A CIRCLE
11044,THEY ARE A SOURCE OF LIGHT THAT THEY ARE A SOURCE OF ENERGY THAT WILL PRODUCE LIGHT WHEN UM THE UH FILAMENT GETS HOT,THEY ARE A SOURCE OF LIGHT THAT THEY ARE SOURCE OF ENARGY THAT CAN WILL PRODUCE LIGHT WHEN UHM THE  FILEMIN UHM GETS HOT
11045,THERE ARE LITTLE BULBS GOING AROUND IN A CIRCLE FROM THE POSITIVE SIDE OF THE BATTERY TO THE NEGATIVE SIDE TO THE LIGHT BULB ALL THE WAY BACK TO THE POSITIVE SIDE OF THE D CELL BATTERY,THERE LITTLE BUBS GOING AROUND IN A CIRCLE FROM THE POSITIVE SIDE OF THE BATERY TO THE NEGETIVE SIDE TO THE LIGHT BUB ALL THE WAY BACK TO THE POSITIVE SIDE OF THE DEECA BATTER
11046,THEY CARRY ELECTRICITY,THEY CARY ALECTRICITY
11047,IT COME FROM THE BATTERY FLOWS THROUGH THE WIRES GENERATES LIGHT AND THEN COMES BACK OUT AND BACK INTO THE POSITIVE SIDE OF THE BATTERY,IT COMES FROM THE BATTER IT FLOWS THRUH THE WIRES JENARATES LIGHT AND THEN IT COMES BACK OUT AND BACK INTO THE POSITIVE SIDE OF THE BATORY
11048,I THINK THAT IT'S A SOURCE OF ENERGY,I THINK THAT IT'S A SOURCE OF ENARGY
11049,THEY ALL LIVE ON EARTH THAT'S WHAT THEY HAVE IN COMMON,THEY ALL LIVE ON EARTH THAT'S WHAT THEY HAVE OUN CO

11191,IT HAS A PLUS AND MINUS SIGN,WE HAD THE PERSON MANASIE
11192,WHEN IT LIGHTS UP,WHENE NIGHTS OUT
11193,BECAUSE IT HAS A WIRE CAUSE THE WIRE IS GO IS GOING THROUGH THE LIGHT BULB,BECAUSE IT HAS A WIRE  HAS A WIRN N GO AN GOING THROUGH THE THE NIGH UP
11194,THE PLUS SIGN,POSTN
11195,GOOD BYE MARNIE,GOODBYE MORNING
11196,IF ONE BULB STAYS ON THEN ONE BULB IF ONE BULB UM TURNS OFF AND THEN THE OTHER BULB WILL S UM UM STAY ON,IF ONE BOOK STAYS ON THEN ONE BO IF ONE BOKS UHM TURNS OF ND THEN THE OTHER BABILS UHM UHM STAY ON
11197,IT ALL MEANS THAT THERE ARE,SALL MEANS THE THERCOAT
11198,WE'VE BEEN WORKING WITH MAGNETS TRYING TO LIGHT UP LIGHT BULBS AND TRYING TO MAKE UM MOTOR'S WORK,HE'VE BEN WORKING WITH MAGNETS TRYING TO KNIGHT U NIGHT BUB AND TRYING TO MAKE UHM MOES WORK
11199,THERE'S ONE BATTERY TWO LIGHT BULBS AND A WIRE'S TRY THE WIRES UM LIGHTING UP THE LIGHT BULB,THERE'S ONE BATTER TONIGHT BOBS AND A WISH SHINE THE WIR LUM LIGHTING UP THE NIGHT BOK
11200,CAN I SEE THE OTHER PICTURE AGAIN,CA SIVIEL THE PICTURED I
11201,ONE WIRE'S UM,ON WS
11202,UM TWO LIGHT BULBS ARE LIGHTING WITH ONE BATTERY,M TONIPOBS ARE NITIG WITH ONE BATER T
11203,GOOD,GOOD
11204,IT'S IMPORTANT BECAUSE UH ONE WIRE'S ONE WIRE'S LIGHTING ONE LIGHT BULB AND THE OTHER WIRE'S LIGHTING THE OTHER LIGHT BULB,IT'S IMPORTANT BECAUSE O ONE WIR ONE WIRE NIGHTING WHENE NIGHT B UP AND THE OTHER WISEKNIGHTING THE OTHER KNIGHT BUB
11205,YES,YES
11206,THE POSITIVE SIDE AND THE OTHER ONE'S ON THE NEGATIVE SIDE AND THE NEGATIVE SIDE WHERE THE WIRES GOES THROUGH THE METAL AND TO THE POSITIVE SIDE,THE POSITIVESIDE AND THE OLEONS ON THE NEGET IFSIDE AND THENEGETIVES SIDE WHERE THE WIRS GOES THROUGH THE MEDO N TO THE POSITE FSIDE
11207,I HAVE TWO,I HAVE TO R
11208,THERE'S ONLY ONE WIRE ON THE BATTERY AND TWO WIRES WHERE THE LIGHT BULB IS,THRE WS ONLY ONEA AND BAT IN T WE HN Y BUGUS
11209,YES TWO LIGHT BULBS AND ONE BATTERY,THER TON MY PUPS AND ONE BETTER
11210,CAN I SEE THE OTHER ONE AGAIN,CAN I SE THELLO ONE AGAN
11211,HMM IT'S A LITTLE DIFFERENT,IT'S A LITTLE DIFFERENT
11212,LIGHT BULB,WIT W
11213,I TOOK THE METER STICK AND I PRETENDED THAT THERE IS TWO AND THEN SO THEN IT LOOKED LIKE IT WOULD BE T ABOUT TWO METER STICKS LONG,I TOOK THE MEETER STICK AND I PRETENDED THAT THERE WAS TWO AND THEN SALIN LOOKD LIKE IT WOULD BE ABOUT TWO MEET EOR STICKS LONG
11214,WE MEASURED IT WITH UM WITH UM METER STICKS AND DECIMETERS AND UM CENTIMETERS,WE MEASURED IT WITH UHM BOTH UHM METER STICKS AND DUS METERS AND UHM SAID THE METORS
11215,MMM YOU MEASURE YOURSELF AND THEN I CAN'T REMEMBER,PL YOU MEASURE YOURSELF AND THENI CAN' REMEMBER
11216,UM I'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT MEASUREMENTS,DOCTO O TELL ER TOT WAT O UHM I'V BEEN LEARNING UP TO HELP MESURMENT
11217,ONE METER LONG,ONE METEARLONG
11218,UM I'VE BEEN DOING LIKE I'VE BEEN MEASURING OUR BODY AND DIFFERENT PARTS OF IT,UHM I'VE BEE DOING LIKE I'VEBEEN MEASURING YOUR BODY IN DIFERENT PARTS OF IT
11219,WELL IT WAS FUN CAUSE WE GOT TO LEARN LIKE HOW BE HOW LONG OUR ARM SPAN IS AND HOW TALL WE ARE AND LIKE HOW LONG OUR FOOT IS AND IT WAS REALLY FUN,WELL IT WAS FUNCAUSE WE GOTSLEARING LIKE HOW BIT HOW LONG OUR ARM SPANDAS AND HOW TALL WE ARE AND LIKE HOW LONG OUR FOOT ISNDSUALLY FUN
11220,TWO METERS LONG,TWO MEETERS LONG
11221,HE'S MEASURING HOW LONG HE IS,HIS MEASURING HOW LONG HE IS
11222,YOU TR USE YOUR MATH SKILLS YOU TRY TO GUESS WHAT WHAT HOW MUCH SOMETHING IS OR WHAT THE ANSWER IS,YOU T YOU USEYOUR MASGALES YOU TRIE TO GUESS WHAT WHA HOW MUCH SOMETHING AENSER WHAT THE ANSWER IS
11223,YES,YES
11224,YES,YES
11225,A DECIMETER A CENTIMETER AND A METER,A DEIMTER A SENTIMETOR AND A METER
11226,I MEAN YOU TAKE THE METER STICK AND YOU PUT IT ON THE END OF THE THE METER STICK ON THE FLOOR AND THEN YOU PUT AND THEN YOU KEEP MEASURING AND THEN YOU KNOW HOW MUCH HE IS,I MEA YOU TAKE THE METER STICK AND YOU PUT IT ON THE END OF THE MUSTIC ON THE FLOOR AND THEN YOU PUT AND THEN YOU KEEP MEASURING IT THENEN YOU KNOW HOW MUCH HE IS
11227,FINGER,FINGER
11228,BECAUSE THE SPACE THAT DOESN'T HAVE THE METER STICK IT'LL THAT PART LOOKS LIKE THE SAME AMOUNT THAT THE METER STICK IS,BECAUSE THE SPACE THAT DOESN'T HAVE THE METER STICK  F THAT PART LOOKS LIKE THE SAME AMOUNT THAT THE METER STICK IS
11229,YOU'RE MEASURING HIS FINGER SO IT'S ELEVEN CENTIMETERS,YOU'RE MEASURING HIS FINGERS SO IT'S ELEVEN SENT TO MEETORS
11230,THAT I WAS CORRECT,THAT I WAS CORRECKT
11231,HOW LONG HE IS,HOW LONG HEIS
11232,UM I THINK LEARNING ABOUT HOW YOU HOW LONG SOMETHING IS OR YEAH,UHM I THINK LEARNING ABOUT HOW YOU HOW LONG SOMETHING IS ER YEA
11233,YOU PUT THE END OF THE METER STICK ON THE FLOOR AND THEN YOU COUNT EACH CENTIMETER AND THEN YOU BRING THE METER STICK UP AND THEN YOU KNOW HOW MUCH IT IS,YOU PUT THE END OF THE BEATYOR STICK ON THE FLOOR AND THEN YOU COUNT EACH SEN A METEOR AND THEN YOU BRING THE MEATER STICK UP AND THEN YOU KNOW HOW MUTCH IS
11234,CENTIMETERS ARE ABOUT HOW THAT'S ANOTHER TOOL YOU CAN USE TO MEASURE SOMETHING,SMTHE MEN DESER BOUT HOW THAT'S ANOTHER JEYOU CAN USE TO MEASURE SOMETHING
11235,I DON'T KNOW,I DON'T KNOW
11236,SO WE KNOW HOW HOT OR COLD SOMETHING IS,SO WE KNOW HOW HATER CLD SOMETHING IS
11237,COULD MEAS THEY'RE MEASURING HOW HOT OR COLD IT IS,YO MESR THEI'RE MEASURING HOW HADT AR COLD IT IS
11238,WE'VE BEEN DOING CAPACITY AND THE TEMPERATURE OF WATER,WEE'VBEEN DOING COUPASITY AND THE TEMPEATURE OF WATER
11239,I THINK IT'S SIXTY DEGREE CELSIUS BECAUSE FIFTY DEGREE CELSIUS PLUS TEN DEGREE CELSIUS EQUALS SIXTY DEGREE CELSIUS,I THINK IT'S SIX DIRTY SACIUS BECAUSE FIFTY DEGRE ASIAS PLUS TEN DAGREE SASIUS EQUAL SIXTY AGREE SAUSIUS
11240,I THINK THAT IF ONE CUP IS FIFTY DEGREE CELSIUS AND ONE IS TEN DEGREE CELSIUS THEY'LL GO TOGETHER AND THEN IT'LL BE SIXTY DEGREE CELSIUS,I THINK THAT IF ONE CUP IS FIFTY DEGREE SOSIUS AND ONE AS TEN DEGREE SOSIES WOUL GO TOGETHER AND THEN IT WILL BE SIXTY TO GREASEESIES
11241,BECAUSE MAYBE THE WATERS THE TEMPERATURES MAYBE BECAUSE THEY WERE DIFFERENT THEY ENDED UP BEING A DIFFERENT THINGS AND DIFFERENT TEMPERATURE INSTEAD OF SIXTY,BECAUSE MAYBE THE WATER THE TEMPERTURES ME BECAUSE THEE WER DIFFERENT THEY ENDED UP BEING  DIFFERENT THINGS IN DFERENT TEMPERTURE INSTEAD OF SIXTY
11242,THAT SOMETIMES WE MEASURE STUFF IT COULD BE A DIFFERENT ANSWER THAN WHAT YOU REALLY THINK,THAT SOMETIMES WE U MEASURE STUFF IT CAULD BE A DIFERENTENCHI AND WHAT YOU REALLY THINK
11243,WE TOOK A THERMOMETER AND WE PUT IN THE WATER AND WE MEASURED IT WITH UM CELSIUS,WE TOOK AT THERMOMATURE AND WE PUT IN THE WATER AND WE MEASURED IT WITH UHM SELSCIAS
11244,YES,YES
11245,UM THEY'RE POURING WATER INTO THE UM CUP,AR THEIR PUING WATER INTO THE UHM CUP
11246,GOOD,GOOD
11247,WE MEASURED THE WATER WITH HOW HOT OR COLD THE WATER IS,WE MEASURE THE WATER WITH HOW HATER COLD THE WATER IS
11248,THE SOLAR PANEL WILL GET ENOUGH SUNLIGHT AND THEN THE MOTOR WILL RUN,THE SULER PAN  WILL GET ENOUGH SUNLIGHTS AND THEN THE MOATER WILL RUN
11249,WELL THE SUN RAYS GO ONTO THE SOLAR PANEL AND THEN WHEN THE WIRES ARE IF THEY'RE CONNECTED TO A MOTOR SOMETHING THE MOTOR WILL START TO RUN IF THERE IS ENOUGH SUN,WELL THE SUN RASE GO ONTO THE SOULER PANAL AND THEN WHEN THE WIRES ARE CIF THEY'RECONECTED TO A MOTOR SOMETHING THE MOTOR WILL START TO RUN IF THERE IS ENOUGH SUN
11250,THAT THE MOTOR IS RUNNING BECAUSE ENERGY IS NOW FLOWING AGAIN THANKS TO THE CIRCUIT,THAT THE MOTOR IS RUNING CAUSE ENARGY IS NOW FLOWING AGAIN THANKS THE CIRCUT
11251,IT DEPENDS LIKE IF IT IS PARTLY CLOUDY IT WILL MAYBE STILL RUN BUT IF IT'S REALLY CLOUDY AND CAN'T REALLY SEE THE SUN THEN NO,IT DEPENDS LIKE IF IT IT IS PARLY CLOUDY IT WIL MAYBE STILL RUN BUT IF IT'S REALLY CLOUDY CAN ONLY SEE THE SUN THEN KNOW
11252,ENERGY AND ELECTRICITY,ENERGYN ELECTRISCITY
11253,WELL IT IS SENDING OUT ELECTRICITY THROUGH THE WIRES TO THE NEGATIVE SIDE AND THEN BACK TO THE POSITIVE SIDE,WELL IT IS SENDING OUT ELETRISITY THROUGH THE WIR SO THE NEGETIVE SIDE AN THEN BACK TO THE POSITIVE SIDE
11254,THAT IT IS SUNNY ENOUGH SO THE SOLAR PANEL IS GETTING ENOUGH SUNLIGHT FOR THE SOLAR PANEL TO RUN,THAT IS SUNY ENOUGH SO THE SILLER PANAL IS GETTING ENOUGH SUNLIGHT FOR THE MOATOR TO RUN
11255,THE WIRES HAVE TO BE UM TO BE ATTACHED TO THE SOLAR PANEL SO THEN THE SOLAR PANEL WILL GET LIGHT WILL GET SUNLIGHT AND THEN THE MOTOR WILL START TO RUN,THE WIERS HAVE TO BE A TRI UHM TO BE ATTATCHED TO THE SOULLER PANDALS SO THET THE SULLER PANDAL WILL GET LIGHT WILL GET SUNLIGHT AND THEN THE THE MOATOR WILL START TO RUN
11256,THE UM THE UM SOLAR PANEL WON'T GET ENOUGH UM SUNLIGHT SO THE MOTOR WON'T RUN,THE UHM THE SUHM SILLER PANDAL WON'T GET ENOUGH U SUNLIGHT SO THEN THE MOATOR WON'T RUN
11257,THE SOLAR PANEL IS NOT GETTING ENOUGH SUN SO THE THE MOTOR IS WILL STOP RUNNING,THE SOULLER PANAL IS NOT GETTING ENOUGH SUN SO THE FLAT THE MOTOR IS STOPE  WILL STOP RUNNING
11258,IT TURNS SUNNY AGAIN AND THE MOTOR IS RUNNING,IT TURNS SUNNY AGAIN AND THE MOADORS RUNNING
11259,ELECTRICITY IS FLOWING UM TO THE MOTOR BY THE WIRES,EA I MEAN ELECTRISITY IS FLOWING UHM TO THE MOTOR BY THE WIRES
11260,IT IS OFF SO THE ELECTRICITY IS FLOWING THROUGH THE WIRES,IT IS ASO THE ELLECTRISITY IS FLOWING THROUGH THE WIRES
11261,WELL WE YESTERDAY WE WERE USING THESE SOLAR PANELS AND SEE IF IF WE HAD ENOUGH SUNLIGHT TO SEE IF THE MOTOR WILL RUN FROM THE SOLAR PANEL,WELL WE YESTERDAY WE WEN USING ME SOULER PANALS AND SEE IF IF WE HAD ENOUGH SUNLIGHT TO SEE IFT THE MOADER WILL RUN FROM THE SULLER PANAL
11262,THE MOTOR IS RUNNING CAUSE THERE IS A LOT OF SUN,THE MOADOR IS RUNNINGCAUSE THERE IS A LOT OF SUN

11351,IT GETTING ENERGY,YOU'RE GETTING ENARGY
11352,IT WILL SAVE A LOT OF ENERGY BECAUSE THEY DON'T IT DOESN'T HAVE FOSSIL FUELS AND IT JUST NEEDS TO SHINE ON THE SOLAR PANEL,IT 'ILL SAVE A LOT OF ENARGY BECAUSE THEY DON'T H THEY DOESN'T HAVE FOSIL FIELDS AND IT JUST NEEDS THE SUN TO SHIN ON THEUSCLLER PANAL
11353,I THINK THAT THE GIRL'S HAVING ENERGY CAUSE SHE'S EATING AN APPLE RIGHT NOW SO SHE'S HAS A LOT OF ENERGY TO HIKE UP THE HILL,I THINK THAT THE GIRLS  UM AND HAVING ENARGY CAUSE SHE IS EATING THE APPLE RIGHT NOW SAYS SHE HAS A LOT OF ENEARGY TO HIKE UP THE HILL
11354,IT GOT WATER AND SUNLIGHT BUT THE PLANT DID DIDN'T GET ENOUGH AIR PLANTS CAN NOT SURVIVE PLANTS CAN NOT SURVIVE WITHOUT AIR,IT GOT WATER IN SUNLIGHT BUT THE PLANT DI DIDN'T GET ENOUGH AIR PLANTS CANNOT SURVIVE PLANTS CANNOT SURVIVE WITHOUT A
11355,YES BECAUSE ALL LIVING ORGANISMS DEPEND ON FOOD SUNLIGHT AND WATER,YES BECAUSE ALL LIVING ORGONISOMS DEPEND ON FOOD SUNLIGHT WHEN WATER
11356,ONE IS GETTING OLDER AND ONE IS PERFECTLY THE SAME,ONE IS GETTING OLDER AND ONE IS PERFECTLY THE SAME
11357,YES BECAUSE UH BECAUSE THE PLANTS CAN HAVE CAUSE THE PLANTS NEED NUTRITION WITH THE FERTILIZER AND IT'LL HELP THE PLANTS GROW NOT ALL PLANTS NEED FERTILIZER,YES BECAUSE BECAUSE THE PLANTS CAN HAVECAUSE THE PLANTS NEED TO NEW TRISHION WITH THE FURTLLIZER AND WE'LL HELP THE PLANTS GROW NOT ALL PLANTS NEED FURTALLIZER
11358,THIS PLANT HAS BEEN GETTING WATER AIR AND SUNLIGHT PLANTS NEED ALL THOSE THINGS TO SURVIVE SO NOW THE PLANT IS A HAPPY HEALTHY PLANT,THIS PLANT HAS BEEN GETTEN WATER AIR IN SUNLIGHT PLANTS NEED ALL THOSE THINGS TO SURVIVE SO NOW THE PLANT IS A HAPPY HEALTHY PLANT
11359,IT MEANS THE PLANT HAS ENOUGH OF EVERYTHING AND THE PLANT CAN SURVIVE,IT MEANS THE PLANT HAS ENOUGH OF EVERYTHING AND THE PLANT CAN SURVIVE
11360,IN THE PICTURE THE YEAST IS RISING,IN THE PICTURE THE EAST IS RISING
11361,PLANTS CAN NOT SURVIVE WITH SUNLIGHT AND IT IF IT DON'T HAVE ENOUGH SUNLIGHT IT WILL NOT GROW SO GETTING WATER AND AIR SO THE PLANT IS NOT,W PLANTS CAN NOT SURVIVE WITH SUNLIGHT IN I TIL HAVE SNOK SUNLIGH IT IL NOT GROW SAVE BENGING WATER AND AIR SO THE PLANT IS OUND
11362,BECAUSE IT HAS BEEN GETTING SUNLIGHT AIR AND WATER,BECAUSE IT HAS BEEN GITING SUNLIGHT AIR AND WATER
11363,I THINK IT INVOLVES THE YEAST RISING,I THINK IT ENVALVES THE AST RISING
11364,THAT IF PLANTS DON'T HAVE AIR THEN THE PLANTS DON'T HAVE ANY AIR TO BREATHE OUT TO BREATHE SO THE PLANT WILL DIE,THAT IF PLANTS DON'T HAVE AIR THEN THE PLANTS DON'T HAVE ANY AIR TO BREATH THA TO BREATH SO THE PLANT WILL DI
11365,PLANTS NEED WATER BECAUSE IT'LL GET DRIED UP AND IF IT GETS DRIED UP IT WILL DIE,PLANTS NEED WATER BECAUSE ITLL GET DRIED UP AND IF IT GETS DRIED UP IT'LL DIE
11366,THEY START AS UM THEY START AS COMPOSERS AND THEN END AS,THEY START AS UHM THEY START AS COMPOSURS AND THEN AND AS D
11367,THE UM THE PLANT HAS ENOUGH WATER AND AIR BUT IT HAD TOO MUCH SUNLIGHT SO THE PLANT SHRIVELED UP,THEM THE PLANT HAS ENOUGH WATER AND AIR BUT IT HAD TOO MUCH SUNLIGHT SO THA PLANTS RIVELED UP
11368,BECAUSE THE ONE ON THE LEFT IS DRIED UP THE ONE ON THE RIGHT IS NOT DRIED UP,BECAUSE THE ONE ON THE LEFT IS DRIED UP THE ONE ON THE RIGHT IS S NOT DRIED UP
11369,BECAUSE THE BECAUSE IF THE PLANT DOESN'T HAVE WATER THE PLANT WILL SHRIVEL UP AND THEN IF THE PLANT DOES GET LOTS OF WATER IT WILL DIE,BECAUSE THE BECAUSE IF THE PLANT DOESN'T HAVE WATER THE PLANT WILL SURV UP AND THEN IF THE PLANT DOESN'T GET ALSO WATER IT WILL DIE
11370,IT GOT TOO MUCH SUNLIGHT,IT GOT TOO MUCH SUNLI

11588,CAPACITY TELLS YOU HOW MUCH SOMETHING HOLDS TOO,COUPASITY TELLS YOU HOW MUCH SOMETHING WHOLS TOO
11589,I CAN TELL YOU ABOUT CAPACITY IS CAPACITY IS THE TOP OF SOMETHING,I CAN TELL YOUABOUT COPASITY IS COPASITY IS THE TOP OF SOMETHING
11590,WELL CAPACITY IS SOME IT IS HOW THE VOLUME PRETTY MUCH OR HOW MUCH SOMETHING CAN HOLD WHICH THAT'S WHAT VOLUME MEANS,WELL A COPASITY IS SOME IT IS HOW THE VOLUME PRETY MUCH OR HOW MUCH SOMETHING CAN HOLD WHICH THAT'S WHAT VOLUME MEANS
11591,YES I DO DO YOU GET IT,YES I DO DO YOU GET IT
11592,IT'S ALL ABOUT IF AS YOU SEE UM RIGHT ON THE RIGHT MIDDLE IT SAID THE CAPACITY IS THREE HUNDRED AND THIRTY THREE MILLILITERS,IT'S ALL ABOUT IF AS YOU SEE UHM RIGHT ON THE RIGHT MIDDLE IT SAID THE COPASITY IS THREE HUNDRED AND THIRTY THREE MILLON LEADERS
11593,WELL CAPACITY IS HOW MUCH SOMETHING CAN HOLD AND TO THE TOP,WELL COPASITY IS HOW MUCH SOMETHING CAN HOLD IN TO THE TOP
11594,IT IS FILLED TO THE TOP,IT IS FILLED TO THE TOP
11595,WE HAVE BEEN MEASURING CANS AND WE'RE SEEING LIKE HOW MUCH THE VOLUME IS SO HOW MUCH IT HER HOLDS,WE HAVE BEENG MEASURING CANS AND WERE SNG LIKE HOW MUCH THE VOLUME IS O HAM SHAPE HER HOLDS
11596,WE'VE BEEN USING GRADUATED CYLINDERS TO MEASURE HOW MUCH SOMETHING IS LIKE THE CAPACITY OF IT,WEVE BEEN USING GRADUATED SILLINDERS TO MEASURE HOW MUCH SOMETHING IS LIKE THE COPASITY OF IT
11597,I I SEE THAT THE METAL CHIP IS MORE THAN THE PLASTIC CHIP,I S I SEE THAT THE METLE CSHIP IS MORE THAN THE PLASTIC SHIP
11598,GOOD,GOOD
11599,I KNOW THAT HOW ONE IS MORE IN ONE CUP IT MEANS THAT ONE HAS MORE MASS INSIDE OF IT THAN THE OTHER,I KNOW THAT HOW ONE IS MORE IN ONE CUP IT MEANS THAT ONE HAS MORE MAS INSIDE OF IT  THAN THE OTHER
11600,THAT IF ONE IS METAL AND ONE IS PLASTIC THE METAL ONE WOULD PROBABLY BE MORE WEIGHT,THAT IF ONE IS MEDDL AND ONES PLASTIC THE MEDDLE ONE WOULD PROBABLY BE MORE WAT
11601,BYE I WAS I HAVE TO GO RIGHT NOW SO HOPEFULLY I CAN SEE YOU NEXT TIME,BY L S I HAVE TO GO RIGHT NOW SO HAY I CAN SEE YOU NEXT TIME
11602,MAY YOU REPEAT THAT AGAIN,MAY YOU REPEAT THAT AGAIN
11603,I HAVE BEEN DOING BALANCES WHERE YOU WEIGH SOMETHING,I HAV BEEN DOING BLANCES WHERE YOU WEG SOMETHING
11604,WHAT YOU COULD DO IS YOU COULD LOOK AT ALL EM AND THEN GET A BALANCE AND THEN WEIGH WHICH ONE IS HEAVIER THAN THE OTHER,WHAT YOU COULD DO IS YOU COULD LOOK AT ALL OVE THEM AND THEN GET A BALINCE AND THEN WAY WHICH ONE IS HEAVIYER THAN THE OTHER
11605,IT WOULD MAKE IT NON ACCURATE BECAUSE ONE IS BIGGER AND ONE IS SMALLER SO YOU WOULD HAVE TO USE MORE SMALLER ONES TO ADD UP THE BIGLER ONE,A WOULD MAKE IT NON ACUIT BECAUSE ONE ISA BIGGER AND ONE IS SMALLER SO YOU WOUL HAVE TO USE MORE SMALLER ONES TO AD UP TO THE BIGGR ONE
11606,ACCURATE MEASUREMENTS IS THAT IT MEANS ACCURATE MEANS LIKE IT'S KINDA RIGHT ON TRACK,ACURIT MEASUREMENTS IS THAT IT MEANS ACURIT MEANS LIKE IT'S KIND OF RIGHT ON TRACK
11607,WAIT TELL ME THIS ARE YOU GETTING ANYTHING YOU'RE SAYING,WAIT TELL ME THIS ARE YOU GETTING ANYTHING YOUR SAYIN
11608,ONE BIG PAPER CLIP AND ONE SMALL PAPER CLIP,ONE BIG PAPER CLIP IN ONE SMALL PAPER CLIP
11609,OKAY,OK
11610,BECAUSE UM WHEN LIKE ANIMALS DIE THEY'RE THEY'RE JUST THEIR BONES SO THEN THEY EAT ALL OF THAT TO BREAK THE BONES DOWN,BECAUSE UHM WHEN LIKE ANIMALS DIE THERE J THEY'RE JUST THEIR BONES SO THEN THEY EAT ALL AF THAT TO BREAK THE BONES DOWN
11611,IT'S BECAUSE IT'S LIKE THE ONLY FOOD THEY EAT CAUSE JUST SOME PEOPLE JUST ARE LIKE KINDA LIKE A VEGETARIAN SO THEY JUST EAT LIKE YOU KNOW,IT'S BECAUSE IT'S LIKE THE ONLY FOOD THEY EATCAUSE JUST SOME PEOPLE JUST ARE LIKE KINDOF LIKE A VEGITARION SO THEY JUST EAT LIKE YOU KNOW
11612,I DON'T KNOW HOW TO SPEAK BUT KINDA LIKE A VEGETARIAN,I DON'T KNOW HOW TO SPAKE BUT KIND LIKE A VEGUATARION
11613,I THINK THEY GET THEIR ENERGY FROM WHEN THEY EAT BONES AND BREAK THEM DOWN,I THINK THEY GET THEIR ENARGY FROM WHEN THEY EAT BONS AND BREAK THEM DOWN
11614,THEY ATE ALL THAT PAPER AND LEAVE AND WHEN ONCE THEY POOPED IT OUT IT TURNED INTO SOIL,THEY AT ALL OF THAT PAPER AND LEAVES AND IT WHEN ONCE THEY POOPED IT OUT IT TURNE INTO SOIL
11615,I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE WORD IS BUT I THINK IT'S ANOTHER WORD TO DESCRIBE IT IS LIKE VEGETARIAN,I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE WORD IS BY THIN IS BUT T ANOTHER WORD TO DESCRIB IS LIKE VEGITARION

11625,IT TELLS ME NOT LIKE US HUMANS OR CARNIVORE OR HERBIVORES THEY DON'T EAT THAT KIND OF STUFF ONLY DECOMPOSER EAT THAT KIND OF STUFF,IT TELLS ME NOT LIKE US HUMANS OR CBOARS OR HURB VOYICE THEY DON'T EAT THAT KIND O STUFF ONLY DEECOMPOSERE T EAT THAT KIND OF STUFF
11626,A PLANT LIKE GROWS IT'S OWN FOOD THROUGH PHOTOSYNTHESIS KINDA LIKE A CYCLE OR ECOSYSTEM AND IT'S KINDA LIKE AN EVOLUTION,A PLANT LAG GROWS ITS OWN FOOD THROUGH POTOF SEMPACS KIND OF LIKE AN SICAL OR EACO SISTOM AND IT'S KINDOF LICKND IN I EVALVES IN
11627,IT'S KINDA LIKE WHEN WE RECYCLE AND THROW AWAY TRASH,IT'S KINDOF LIKE WHEN WE WERE SCICLE AND THROW AWAY TRASH
11628,I THINK IT WHAT IT HAS TO DO IS LIKE UM,I THINK IT WHAT IT HAS TO DO IS LIKE UHM
11629,ANIMALS GET THEIR ENERGY FROM THE PRODUCERS FROM LIKE EATING AND DRINKING AND KINDA LIKE ENERGY FROM THE SUN LIKE JUST LIKE PRODUCERS MAYBE,ANIMALS GET THEIR ENARGY FROM THE PREDUERS FROM LIKE EATING AND TRINKING AND KINDOF LIKE ENARGY FROM THE SOUND LIKE JUST LIKE PRODUCERS MAYBE
11630,IT'S BECAUSE THEY DON'T EAT ANYTHING AND THEY JUST MAKE THEIR OWN FOOD SO LIKE THE CONSUMERS COULD EAT THEM,IT'S BECAUSE THEY DON'T EAT ANYTHING AND THEY JUST MAKE THEIR OWN FOODS SO LIKE THE CUN SOMERS CAN EAT THEM
11631,THEY EAT IT ALL AND THEN ONCE THEY POOP IT OUT IT TURNS INTO SOIL,THEY EAT IT ALL AND THEN ONCE THE POOP IT OUT IT TURNS INTO SOIL

11656,GOOD,GOOD
11657,THEY GO THROUGH THEIR OWN PHOTOSYFESIS TO MAKE THEIR OWN FOOD,THEY GO THROUGH THEIR OWN PHOTAC SIMPFINCES TO MAKE THEIR OWN FOOD
11658,WHAT MAKES A PLANT A PRODUCER IS BECAUSE IT MAKES IT'S OWN THROUGH PHOTOSYNFESIS UM FROM SUNSHINE AND WATER,WHAT MAKES A PLANT A PRODUCER IS BECAUSE IT MAKES ITS OWN THROUIT FRUIT TOTO SIMFINCIS UHM FROM SUNSHINE IND WATER
11659,IT ONLY EATS PLANTS THAT MEANS IT'S A HERBIVORE,IT ONLY EATS PLANTS THAT MEANS ITS A HURBEFORE

11664,GET THEIR ENERGY FROM EATING OTHER THEY CAN'T THEY CAN'T EAT THEMSELVES BECAUSE AND THEY CAN'T MAKE THEIR OWN FOOD SO THAT'S WHY THEY HAVE TO EAT THE OTHER ANIMALS AND THEY EAT PRODUCERS,LE'S GET THER ENERGY FROM EATING OTHER THEY CAN'T THEY CAN'T EAT THEEMSELVES BECAUSES AND THEY CAN'T MAKE THEIR OWN FOOD SO THAT'S WHY THEY HAVE TO AT OTHER ANIMALS AND THEY PREDUCERS
11665,IT'S NOT A PRODUCER OR A CONSUMER IT'S A DECOMPOSER,I'S NOT A PRODUCER OR CONSUMER IT'S A DECOMPOSURE
11666,THEY EAT IT ALL AND THEN THEY TURN IT INTO SOIL THAT'S WHY THEY ARE A DECOMPOSER,THEY EAT IT ALL AND THEN THEY TURN IT INTO SOIL THAT'S WHY THEY ARE A DEECOMPOSURE

11668,WHAT IT'S ALL ABOUT BECAUSE IT BREAKS DOWN HERE OR DIGGING UM ALL ORGANISTS OF MATTER,WHAT IT'S ALL ABOUT BECAUSE IT BREAKES TDOWN HER OR DIGING DICARIA UHM ALL ORGONES OF MATTER
11669,NO THEY ARE NOT,KNOW THEY ARE NOT
11670,I THINK WHY IT'S SO IMPORTANT IS JUST BECAUSE UM THEY RETURN NUTRIENTS AND WE NUTRIENTS IN OUR BODY,I THINK WHY IT'S SO IMPORTANT I'S JUST BECAUSE UHM THEY RETURN KNEW TRANS AND WE KNEW TRANS IN OUR BODY
11671,I THINK WHAT'S TO BE A CONSUMER IS UM TO UM EAT OTHER THINGS THEY'RE NOT THEY DON'T THEY CAN'T MAKE THEIR OWN FOOD THEY HAVE TO EAT OTHER THINGS TO GET THEIR ENERGY,I THINK WHAT' TO BE A CONSUMER IS UHM TO UM EAH OTHER THEIR THINGS THEY'RE NOT THEY DON'T THEY CAN'T MAKE THEIR OWN FOOD THEY HAVE TO EAT OTHER THINGS TO GET THEIR ENARGY

11673,I THINK WHAT IT MEANS TO BE A DECOMPOSER THAT IT MEANS IT EATS IT AND THEN IT UM RETURNS NUTRIENTS TO THE EARTH,I THINK WHAT B MEANS TO BE A T COMPOSURE THAT IT MEANS IT EATS IT AND THEN IT T UHM RETURTS NEW TRAN TO THE EARTH
11674,BECAUSE THEY BREAK DOWN BONES AND ALSO THEY CAN TURN IT INTO SOMETHING NEW LIKE SOIL JUST LIKE WORMS,BECAUSE THEY BREAKE DOWN BONES AND ALSO THEY CUNTUR IT INTO SOMETHING NEWLIKE SOIL JUST LIKE WARMS
11675,THE DECOMPOSERS ARE MUSHROOM OR FUNGI AND BACTERIA,THE DEEP COMPOSURES ARE MUSHROOM OR FUN GUY IN BACKTERIA
11676,I BEEN LEARNING ABOUT THE FOOD WEB ALSO PRODUCERS DECOMPOSERS AND CONSUMERS,I'V BEEN LEARNING ABOUT THE FOOD WEB ALSO PRODUSERS TYCOMPOSURS AND CONSUMERS
11677,IT'S A DECOMPOSER IT EATS DECAYING AND DECAYING MATTER AND RETURNS NUTRIENTS TO THE EARTH,IT'S A DEECOMPOSUR IT EAS DICAN AND DICAYN MATER AND RETURNS NEW TRANCE TO THE EARTH
11678,I THINK WHAT THE LUNGS DO IS THAT UM THEY GIVE US OXYGEN AND THE MAIN ORGAN FOR BREATHING IS IN HUMANS AND SO THAT'S WHAT I THINK ABOUT LUNG,I THINK WHAT THE LUNGS DO IS THAT UHM THEY GIVE US OXYGEN AND THE MAIN ORGAN FOR BREATHING IS IN HUMANSE AND SO THAT'S WHAT I THINK ABOUT LONG
11679,THEY UH BRING IN OXYGEN WITH EXCHANGE OF THE CARBON DIOXIDE,E U BRING IN OXGEN WITH EXCHANGE OF THE CARM DIOXKSA
11680,WHAT THE LUNGS DO IS THAT ONCE WE BREATHE IN IT GETS KIND OF FATTER AND BIGGER AND ONCE WE GO OUT IT GETS SMALLER,WHAT THE LUNGS DO IS THAT ONCE WE BREATHE IN IT GETS KIND OF FATER AND BIGER AND ONCE WE BREATHE OUT IT GOS SMALLER
11681,THAT UM IT'S GOING THROUGH AND THROUGH LIKE I SEE LIKE SOME CIRCULAR THINGS AND IT'S GOING BY FROM THE HEART AND THE CAPILLARY AND OTHERS,THAT UHM IT'S GOING THROUGH AND THROUGH LIKE A SEE LIKE SOME CIRCULER THINGS AND IT'S GOING BYLEP FROM THE HART AND THE CAT A PAURLY AND OTHERS
11682,HOW THEY INHALE AND EXHALE IS INHALE IS LIKE ONCE YOU BREATHE IN FROM THE NOSE WHICH IS THE FILTER AND THEN EXHALE IS WHEN YOU BREATHE OUT,HOW THEY INHALN EXAL IS IN HAL IS LIKE ONCE YOU BREATH IN FROM THE NOSE WHICH IS THE FILTER AND THEN EXTALS WHEN YOU BREATH OUT
11683,I THINK WHAT IT'S ALL ABOUT IS THAT IT'S SHOWING HOW UM WHERE AIR GOES IN AND CARBON DIOXIDE GOES OUT IN AND OUT OF YOUR MOUTH OR YOUR NOSE,I THINK WHAT IT'S ALL ABOUT IS THAT IT'S SHOWING HOW UHM WHERE AIR GOES IN AND CARM AKS I GOES OUT IN AN OUT OF YOUR MOUTH OR YOUR NOSE
11684,WHAT THE RESPIRATORY SYSTEM DOES IS LIKE IT HELPS YOU BREATHE LIKE WHEN IT IT GOES IN AND OUT OF YOUR LUNGS WHEN OXYGEN GOES IN AND CARBON DIOXIDE GOES OUT,WHAT THE RESPLITORY SISTOM DOES IS LIKE IT HELPS YOU BREATHE LIKE WHEN IT IT GOES IN AN OUT OF YOUR LUNGS WHEN OXGEN GOES IN I CARMDXSIDE GOES OUT
11685,I SEE LITTLE CIRCLES LIKE IT'S GETTING PASSED THROUGH LIKE A SYSTEM LIKE THE CARBON DIOXIDE IS GOING OUT AND OXYGEN IS GOING IN,I SEE LITTLE CIRCLES LIKE IT'S GETTING PAST THRUGH LIKE A SISTOM LIKE THE CARB DYOXI IS GOING OUT AN OXAD JEN IS GOING IN
11686,DOING GOOD,DOING GOOD
11687,THEY'RE RESPONSIBLE FOR I THINK WHEN CARBON OXYGEN GOES IN AND THEY'RE RESPONSIBLE FOR CARBON DIOXIDE TO GO OUT,THERE RESPONSIBLE FOR I THINK WHEN CAR OXGEN GOES IN AND THERE RESPONSIBLE FOR CAM DAXSIT TO GO OUT
11688,WHAT THE EXCHANGE OF GASES IS ALL ABOUT IS WE SURVIVE WITH OXYGEN WE CAN'T SURVIVE WITH CARBON DIOXIDE CAUSE THAT'S KIND OF A POISON OXYGEN TO US,WHAT THE EXCHANGE OF GASS ALL ABOUT IS WE S SURVIVED WITH OXYGEN WE CAN'T SURVIVE WITH CAR DIOXACAUSE THAT'S KIND OF B POIZON OXYGEN TO US
11689,FIRST OF ALL WE NEED TO SURVIVE SECOND OF ALL UM IT'S OUR ONLY WAY OF LIFE TO BREATHE,FIRST THA VALL WE NEED TO SURVIVE SECOND F ALL UHM ITS OURE ONLY WAY OF LIFE TO BREATH
11690,THAT WOULD PROBABLY BE OXYGEN,THAT WOULD PROBALY BE OXGEN
11691,THE GAS EXCHANGE IS FROM THOSE ALVEOLI AND UM THAT'S WHERE UM WHERE THE OXYGEN GOES IN AND THE CARBON DIOXIDE GOES OUT,AGASTICCHANGEMAN IS FROM THOSE ABVALY AND UHM THAT'S WHERE UHM WHERE THE U OXGEN GOES IN IN THE CARBON DY OXIDE GOES OUT
11692,I THINK IT IS E FOR LUNGS,I THINK IT IS EA FOR LUNGS
11693,I THINK THEIR BEHAVIOR IS SAFETY BECAUSE THEY DON'T WANT TO BE EATEN WHEN THEY ARE FLYING HIGH IN THE AIR,I THINK THERE BEHAVEIEOR IS SAFETY BECAUSE THEY DON'T WANT TO BEAT EATENNTHER FLYING HIGH IN THE AIR
11694,I'M DOING GOOD,I'M DOING GOO
11695,THIS IS A NON LEARNED BEHAVIOR BECAUSE THEY'RE HATCHING FROM THEIR EGG AND THEY'RE THEY'RE ALREADY CRAWLING OUT TO SEA,THIS IS A NONLEN BEHAVIEOR BECAUSE THER HATCHING FROM THEIR EGG AND THEIR TEIR ARE READY CRAWLING OUT TO SE
11696,THE STIMULUS IS BECAUSE THE SKUNK OR THE COYOTE HAS AN ADAPTATION THE SKUNK HAS A,THE STIMULUS IS BECAUSE UHM THE SCUGAR THE KOTI UHM HAS A ABECTATION THE SCUNOUSE
11697,SO I THINK WHY SO IT COULD SWIM AND LIKE IT COULD LIKE IT COULD LIKE PUSH IT IN CASE IF LIKE ONE OF IT'S DUCKLINGS LIKE COMES FALLING BEHIND,SO I THINK WHY  SO IT CAULD SWIM AND LIKE A KI LKE IT COULD LIKE PUSH IT UM INCASIVE LIKE ONE OF ITS DUCK LENS LIKE COMES FALLING BEHIND
11698,HE WOULD PROBABLY ATTACK FOR IT OR JUST RUN AWAY,HE WOULD PROBABLY A TACK FOR IT OR JUST RUN AWAY
11699,THAT THE RATTLESNAKE IS RATTLING IT'S TAIL TO SAY GO AWAY FROM ME OR ELSE I'LL BITE,THE THAT THE RADDTLE SNAKE IS WRALING ITS TIL TO SAY GO AAWAY FROM MYEOU OR ELSE A BIHT
11700,IT'S TELLING THE PERSON LIKE ONCE A SNAKE'S TAIL IT RATTLES THEN IT'S ABOUT TO ATTACK THE PERSON,IT'S TELLING THE PERSON LIKE ONES O SNAKES UHMTIL IT RATLES THEN IT'S ABOUT TO ATTACK THE PERCE
11701,NO,NO
11702,LIKE THE REACTIONS OF PEOPLE AND ANIMALS,LIKE THESE REACTIONS OF PEOPLE AND ANIMALS
11703,I THINK IT'S MIGRATE BEHAVIOR CAUSE THEY'RE LIKE NOT GETTING EATEN,I THINK IT'S MY GREAT BEHAVIOR BECAUSE YOUR LIKE NOT GETTING EAE
11704,THAT THEY WANTED TO PROTECT THEMSELVES FROM OTHER PREDATORS,THAT THEY WANTED TO PRETECT THEMSELVES FROM OTHER PREITERS
11705,LIKE THE FLIPPERS HELP EM KIND OF LIKE FEET TO SWIM AND ALSO THE BEAK FOR LIKE TO EAT LIKE FISH OR SOMETHING FOR LIKE ITS FOOD OR SOMETHING,LIKE UHM THE FLIPPERS HELP THEM KIND LIKE FEET TO SWIM AND ALSO THE BEA UHM FRLKE UM TO EAT LIKE FISH OR SOMETHING FOR LIKE IT'S FOOD OR SOMETHING
11706,IT'S A NOT LEARNED BEHAVIOR,IT'S A NOT LEARNED BEHAVEIOR
11707,THAT IT COULD SHOOT A BAD SMELL OUT OF ITS TAIL,THAT IT COULD SHOUOT THE BAD SMELL OUT OF ITS TAILE
11708,A CAT IS FALLING FROM A TREE,A CAT IS FALLING FROM A TREE
11709,IT'S PRETTY MUCH MARKING ITS TERRITORY SO PREDATORS CAN'T EAT IT AND ALSO HOW ONE WAY THEY COULD DEFEND THEMSELVES,IT'S UHM PRETY MUCH MARKNG IT'S UHM TARITORY SO UHMPRIDERS CAN'T EAT IT AND ALSO HOW UHM ONE WAY THEY COULD DEFEND THEMSELE
11710,I THINK IT'S A LEARNING BEHAVIOR BECAUSE YOU ARE LEARNING HOW TO WRITE YOUR NAME,I THINK IT'S A LEARNING BEHAVEIOR BECAUSE YOU'RE LEARNING HOW TO WRIGHTE YOUR NAME
11711,THAT HE'S TELLING THE PERSON TO GO AWAY OR ELSE I'LL BITE YOU BECAUSE HE'S TRYING TO DEFEND HIMSELF FROM PREDATORS LIKE HUMANS,THAT HE'S TELLING THE PERSON TO GO AWAY RASCALBITE YOU BECAUSE UHM HE'S TRYING TO DEFEND HIMSELF FROM PREDTORS LIKE HUMANS
11712,THAT THE SKUNKS TAIL IS ONE OF THE ADAPTATIONS BECAUSE IT SHOOTS THE SMELL OUT OF IT,TAC THE SKUN'S TILL IS ONE OF THE AGTATIONS BCAUSE IT SHOULD S UHM THE SMELL OUT OF I
11713,THAT THEY ALL HAVE DIFFERENT REACTIONS ON DIFFERENT THINGS,THAT THEY UHM ALL HAVE DIFERENT REACTIONS ON DIFERENT THING
11714,BECAUSE USUALLY ANIMALS ARE SCARED OF BRIGHT COLORS OR PREDATORS ARE SCARED OF BRIGHT COLORS,CAUSE USUALLY UHM ANIMALS ARE SCARED TO BRITE COLORS OR PREDITORS ORE SCARED O BRITE COLORS
11715,LIKE IT'S KIND OF LIKE THE SAME COLOR AS THE GROUND AND ALSO THE TURTLE CAN ACTUALLY HIDE IN ITS SHELL AND ALSO IT CAN COME IN SO NO PREDATORS CAN GET IT,LIKE IT'S CN LIKE THE SAME COOR AS THE GROUND AND ALSO THE TURTLE CAN ACTUALLY HIDE IN ITS SHELL AND ALSO IT CAN COME AND SO P NO PRETORS CAN GET IT
11716,THAT MEANS WHAT THE REACTION PART IS I WOULD PROBABLY JUST GO AWAY FROM IT,THAT MEANS UHM WHAT THE RACTION PART IS I WOULD PROBLY JUST GO AWAY FROM IT
11717,I THINK IT'S A MIGRATION BEHAVIOR BECAUSE THE BLACK THING IS STUCK ON THE HUMAN'S KNEE,I THINK IT'S OF MYGRATIONAL BEHAVIOR BECAUSE UHM THE BLACK THING IS STUCK ON THE HUMANS NEE
11718,THAT LIKE THE DOG WANTS TO CATCH THE FRISBEE AND HE IS HAVING FUN AND ALSO THE BIRDS ARE FLYING TOGETHER SO THEY COULD BE SAFE,THAT LIKE THE DOG ONCE TO CATCH THE PRIZBI AND HES HAVING FUN AND ALSO THE BIRDS ARE FLYNG TOGETHER SO THEY COULND BE SAFE
11719,IT'S INSTINCTIVE BECAUSE IT'S REACTING CAUSE IT'S FALLING AND HE WANTS TO LAND SAFELY ON THE GROUND,IT'S INSTINCTIVE BECAUSE IT'S RE ACTINGCAUSE IT'S FALLING AND HE WANTS TO LAND SAFELY ON THE GROUN
11720,I THINK IT'S KIND OF LIKE LIKE A MIGRATION BEHAVIOR,I THINK IT'S KIND OF LEG AND LIKE A MIRANA BEHAVIEOR
11721,I THINK NUMBER TWO THE TEETH BECAUSE THAT'S HOW IT CHEWS THE MEAT,I THINK NUMBER TO THE TEETH BECAUSE UHM THAT'S HOW IT CHEWS THE MEAT
11722,I THINK IT'S THE WINGS BECAUSE IT HELPS IT FLY AWAY FASTER FROM THE PREDATOR,I THINK IT'S THE WINGS BECAUSE UHM IT HOLPS IT FLY AWAY FASTER UHM FROM THE PREDO
11723,I THINK IT'S SIX BECAUSE THE HOUSES THE LAND THE MOUNTAINS THE SKY THE TREES AND THAT LITTLE UM BLUE GREY BROWN THING,I THINK IT'S SICK BECAUSE THE HOUSES THE LAND THE MOUNTAINS THE SKY THE TREES IN THAT LITTLE UM BLUE GRAY BROWN THING
11724,I SEE THE WATER I SEE THE ATMOSPHERE WHICH IS THE SKY I SEE THE MOUNTAINS I SEE SOME TREES AND SOME HOUSES,I SEE THE WATER I SEE THE ATMSFERE WHIACH SIS THE SKY I SEE THE MOUNTTAINS I SEE SOME TREES AND SOME HOUSES
11725,I THINK THE BIOSPHERE IS MADE OUT OF UM PROBABLY TREES AND HUMANS AND ANIMALS PROBABLY JUST TREES PLANTS AND ANIMALS,I THINK THE BILES FAR IS MADE OUT O UM PROBLY TREES AND HUMINS AND ANIMALS PROBLY JUST TREE'S PLANTS AN ANIMALS THAT'S WHT I THINK
11726,THE BIOSPHERE IS PROBABLY ALL ABOUT LIFE LIKE TREES PLANTS AND US LIKE HUMANS,THE BYCE FEAR IS PROBABLY ALL ABOUT LIFE LIKE TREES PLANTS AND H US LIKE HUMANS
11727,GOOD,B
11728,I THINK THEY'RE JUST TRYING TO SURVIVE NOT LIKE TO GET EATEN BUT PROBABLY THE MOST DANGEROUS ONES ARE A SNAKE A RED TAILED HAWK,I THINK THE'RE JUST TRYING TO SURVIVE NOT LIKED TO GET EATEN BUT PROBLY THE MOST DANGEROUS ONES AREE SNAKE AND A RED TAILED HAWK
11729,WELL PROBABLY MOST ANIMALS GO FOR PROBABLY BACTERIA MUSHROOMS AND UM THE OTHERS JUST GO FOR LIKE PLANTS,OH PROBABLY MOST ANIMALS GO FOR PROBLY BACK TRIA MUSHROOMS AND UHM THE OTHERS JUST GO FOR LIKE PLANTS
11730,I THINK SOME YEAH,I THINK SOMEW YEAH
11731,IT'S KINDA MOSTLY IN THE SAME THING BUT IT'S MOSTLY IN THE WINTER OR LIKE ANTARCTICA OR LIKE WHERE MOUNT EVEREST IS,IT'S KIND OF MOSTLY IN THE SAME THING BUT IT'S MOSTLY IN THE WINTER OR LK UHM AND AR TO GO OR LIKE WHER MOUNTEVER ISIS
11732,I THINK IT REPRESENTS THE CLIMATE OR WEATHER OR LIKE THE TEMPERATURE,I THINK IT REPRESENTS THE CLYMA OR WEATHER OR LIKE THE TEMPEATURE
11733,WHAT IT NEEDS IS TO SURVIVE IS PROBABLY SOIL WATER AIR AND SUNSHINE,WHAT IT NEEDS IS TO SURVIVE IS PROBABLY SWAL WATER AIR AND SUNSH
11734,THEY DON'T GET THEIR OWN FOOD THEY MAKE THEIR OWN FOOD CAUSE THEY'RE A PRODUCER AND IT MAKES IT'S OWN FOOD THROUGH PHOTOSYNTHESIS,THEY DON'T GET THE ROWN FOOD THEY MAKE THE ROWN FOODCAUSE THER A PRODUCER AND IT MAKES ITS ON FOOD THROUGH POOTOCIPANCES
11735,THEY MAKE IT THROUGH THEIR OWN PHOTOSYNTHESIS,THEY MAY ET THROUGH THEIR OWN POTO SIMPPFOCES
11736,IT KIND OF LOOKS GREEN BUT IT IT HAS SUNSHINE AND AIR BUT NO WATER SO THAT'S WHY IT'S KIND OF LIKE BENDING,IT KINDO LOOK SGREEN BUT UHM IT IT HAS SUNSHIN N AIR BUT NO WATER SO THAT'S WHY IT'S KIND OF LIKE BENDING
11737,I THINK ALL THOSE CELLS LIKE COMBINE TO MAKE ONE WHOLE LIKE TINY GRAIN OF SAND OF YEAST,I THINK ALL THOSE SELLVES LIKE COMBINED TO MAKE ONE HOLE LEKE  TINY GRAIN OF SAND AF EA
11738,IT'S LIKE WHAT EATS WHAT AND WHAT EATS THEM,IT'S LIKE WHAT EAT'S WHAT AND WHOD EATS THE
11739,WHEN WATER SUNSHINE AND AIR AND LIKE ALL THOSE COMBINE TOGETHER THE ROOTS GO DOWN INTO THE DIRT AND THEN WHEN WHICH COMES OUT IS LIKE A PLANT,WHEN WATER SUNSHINE IN AIR  LIKE ALL THOSE COMBINED TOGETHER THE ROOTS GO DOWN INTO THE DIRT AND THEN WHEN UHM WHICH COMES OUT IS LIKE A PLA
11740,IT'S KIND OF LIKE WHEN YOU GET LIKE A SUNBURN LIKE A HUMAN AND IT'S GETTING ALL YELLOW CAUSE IT HAS NO SUN AND IT'S NOT GETTING ANY GREEN,IT'S KIND OF LIKE WHEN YOU GET LIKE A SUNBURNE LIKE A HUMAN AND IT'S GETTING ALL YELLOW BECAUSE IT HAS NO SUN IN ITS NOT GETTING ANY GREEN
11741,DOING GOOD,DOING E
11742,THEY DO NOT BECAUSE BECAUSE WHEN IT RAINS IN THE SPRING IT GETS WATER AND THEN SUNSHINE AND THEN IT GETS AIR WHEN IT BLOWS,THEY DO NOT BECAUSE UHM UH BECAUSE WHEN IT RAINS IN THE SPRING IT GETS WATER AND THEN SUNSHINE AND THEN IT GETS AIR WHEN IT BLOWS
11743,I THINK PLANTS I READ A BOOK ABOUT THIS AND IT PROBABLY NEEDS CARBON DIOXIDE WHICH IS KIND OF IT'S AIR,I THINK PLANTS I READ A BOOK ABOUT THIS AND IT PROBLY NEEDS CARM DAY OXSIDE WHICHS KIND OF ITS A
11744,ACTUALLY NO BECAUSE WHEN I DID MY EXPERIMENT IN THE BAG WE DIDN'T USE ANY WATER AND IT'S AND IT'S STILL GROWING ON ITS OWN,ACTUALLY KNOW BECAUSE UHM WHEN I DID MY EXPERIMENT UHM IN THE BAG WE DIDN'T USE ANY WATER IN ITS INIT'S STILL GROWING ON ITS OWN
11745,YES THEY DO NEED IT,S THEY DO NEED IT
11746,YES IT DOES,YES SAIT DU
11747,IT'S BECAUSE THEY WERE ALL SICKLY AND NOT HEALTHY,IT'S BECAUSE THEY WEREL SICKLY AND NOT HEALTHY
11748,IT WOULDN'T BE A PROBLEM BECAUSE LIKE I JUST SAID IT GOES THROUGH IT'S OWN PHOTOSYNTHESIS WHICH IT MAKES IT'S OWN FOOD IT CAN'T EAT ANYTHING,IT WOULDN'T BE A PROBLEM BECAUSE UHM LIKE A JUST SAID UHMMI GOS THROUGH ITS OWN POT OF SIMPUCIS WHICH IT MAKES IT'S OWN FOOD THEY CAN'T EAT ANYTHI
11749,WHEN WE PUT THE PLANTS IN THE BAG IT HAD LIKE A TON OF AIR OR CARBON DIOXIDE IN IT AND THAT'S WHY IT NEEDS TO SURVIVE,WHEN WE PUT THE PLANTS IN THE BAG UHM IT HAD LIKE A TON OF AIR CURB AN DIOXHAD IN IT AND THAT'S WHY IT NEEDS TO SURVIVE
11750,IT HAS TWO OUT OF THREE BUT NOT THREE OUT OF THREE BECAUSE THEY IT NEEDS WATER AIR AND SUNSHINE IT CAN NOT BE WATER AIR AND NO SUNSHINE,IT HAS TWO AT A THREE BUT NOT THREE OUT OF THREE BECAUSE UHM THEY IT NEEDS WATER AIR AND SUNSHINE IT CANNOT BE WATER AIR IN NO SUNSH
11751,I THINK IT'S TRYING TO MAKE SOME KIND OF SIGNAL OR SOMETHING,I THINK IT'S TRYING TO MAKE SOME KIND OF SIGNAL OR SOMETHING
11752,BECAUSE IT CAN'T BREATHE ANY CARBON DIOXIDE AND IT'S NOT BREATHING OUT ANY OXYGEN,BECAUSE UHM IT CAN'T BREATHE ANY CARMVA DIOXSIDE AND IT'S NOT BREATHING OUT ANY OXYGEN
11753,I THINK IT'S KIND OF LIKE PLANTS LIKE THEY NEED SUNSHINE AIR AND WATER,I THINK IT'S KINDO LIKE PLANTS LIKE THEY UHM NEED SUNSHINE AIR IN WATER
11754,YES IT WOULD BE MISSING THREE THINGS SUN WATER AND AIR,GUESS IT WOULD BE MISSING THREE THINGS SUN WATER AND AIR
11755,HOW IT RELATES TO ME IS LIKE IT GOES THROUGH IT'S OWN PHOTOSYNTHESIS IT NEEDS SUNSHINE WATER AND AIR FOR IT TO GROW,HOW IT RELATS TO ME IS L UHM IT GOES THROUGH ITS OTO VO BOATO CIMPUCES AND NEEDS SUNSHINE WATER AN AIR FOR IT TO GROW
11756,WHERE FOOD WEBS START WILL PROBABLY BE AT THE PRODUCERS BECAUSE PROBABLY MOST CONSUMERS EAT THOSE PRODUCERS,WHERE FOOD WEP STAR WILL PROBLY BE AT THE PRODUCERS BECAUSE PROBLY MOST CONSUMERS EAT THOS PRODUCERS
11757,THEY JUST STAY IN ONE PLACE THEY DON'T MOVE BESIDES THEY MAKE THEIR OWN FOOD THROUGH PHOTOSYNTHESIS WITH THE SUN CARBON DIOXIDE AND WATER,I YUS STAY IN WONT PLACE THEY DON'T MOVE BESIDES ON THEY MAKE THER OWN FOOD THROUGH FOTO CEMPICIS WITH UHM THE SUN COME CARPAN DYE OKSIDE AND WAL
11758,THINK WHAT IT'S TRYING TO SHOW IS THAT SUNSHINE REFLECTS OFF THE PLANT SO IT CAN,ITHINK WHAT IS TRYING TO SHOW IS THAT SUNSHINE REFLECTS OF THE PLANT SO IT CAN
11759,BECAUSE GRASS AND THE PINE CONE ON THE TREE ARE PRODUCERS AND THE PLANTS ARE PRODUCERS THEY MAKE THEIR OWN FOOD WHICH THE CONSUMERS EAT,BECAUSE UHM GRAS I IN THE PINE CONE ON THE TREE ARE PREDUCERS AND THE PLANTS ARE PREDUCERS THEY MAKE THEIR OWN FOOD WHICH UHM THE CONSUMERS EAT
11760,YES THEY DO NEED IT BECAUSE IT'S KIND OF LIKE WHAT THEY NEED TO BREATHE,YES THEY DO NEED IT BECAUSE IT'S KIND OF LIKE WHAT THEY NEED TO BREA
11761,WHAT I JUST REALLY THINK IS JUST WHAT EATS WHAT EATS THE PRODUCERS CONSUMERS AND THE DECOMPOSERS,WHAT I JUST REALLY THINK IS JUST WHAT EAT'S WHAT AND WHAT EAT THE PREODUCERS CONSUMERS AND THE DEECOMPOSERS
11762,IT'S BECAUSE IT DOESN'T HAVE ANY WATER,IT'S BECAUSE IT DOESN'T HAVE ANY WATER
11763,I THINK LIGHT WHEN IT REFLECTS SO IT HELPS IT GROW I THINK THE WATER WHEN YOU POUR IT SO IT STAYS HEALTHY AND THE CARBON DIOXIDE WHICH IT BREATHES IN AND OXYGEN IT BREATHES,I THINK LIGHT WHEN IT REFLECTS SO IT HELPS TIT GROW I THINK THE WATER UHM WHEN YOU PORE IT SO IT STAYS HEALTHTHY AND THE COWARDBIN DYHOOK AID WICHAD BREATHS AN AN OXYGEN IT BREATHS
11764,I THINK THEY DO BECAUSE SOME ANIMALS EAT THEM AND THAT WILL PROTECT THEM FROM ANIMALS,I THINK THEY DO BECAUSE UHM SOME ANIMALS EAT THEM AND THAT WILL PRTECT THEM FROM ANIMALS
11765,I THINK WHY IS BECAUSE THERE'S NO WIND AND THERE'S JUST SUNSHINE AND WATER BUT IT HAS TO BE COMPLETE WITH WATER AIR AND SUNSHINE FOR IT TO GROW,I THINK WHY IT IS BECAUSE UHM THERE'S NO WIND AND THERE'S JUST SUNSHINE IND WATER BUT IT HAS TO BE COMPLEATE WITH WATER AIR AND SUNSHINE FOR IT TO GROW
11766,IT HAS WATER SUNSHINE BUT NO AIR,IT HAS WATER SUNSHINE BUT NO AIR
11767,THE SUN,S THE SUN
11768,NO THEY DO NOT NEED FOOD BECAUSE THEY THEY HAVE THEY HAVE THEIR OWN PHOTOSYNTHESIS WHICH THEY MAKE THEIR OWN FOOD,KNOW THEY DO NOT NEED FOOD BECAUSE UHM THEY THEY HAVE THEY HAVE THEIR OWN POTO SUBBENCES WHICH THEY MAKE THEIR OWN FOO
11769,LIKE SOME PEOPLE SAY SO IT DOESN'T DAMAGE IT,LIKE SOME PEOPLE SAY UHM SO IT DOESN'T DAMGE
11770,SOMETIMES WHEN CONSUMERS ARE EATING THEM THEY'LL HAVE TO PUT FERTILIZER AROUND IT SO THE ANIMALS CAN'T EAT CAUSE IF THEY EAT IT IT'LL KIND OF BE LIKE A GROSS TASTE,SOMETIMES WHEN CONSUMERS ARE EATING THEM THEY'LL HAVE TO PUT TURTLE LIZSER AROUND IT SO THE ANIMALS CAN'T EAT IT CAUSE IF THEY EAT IT CANT BE LIKE A GROSE TAST
11771,IT SHOWS LIKE A LIKE A LIKE A SOME KIND OF OF DRINK THAT MAKES IT GROW FOOD,IT SHOWS LIKE A LIKE A LIKE A SOME KIND OF OF DRINK THAT MAKES IT GROW FLU
11772,IT'S BECAUSE THEY DO THEIR OWN PHOTOSYNTHESIS WHICH THEY MAKE THEIR OWN FOOD,IT'S BECAUSE THEY DO THEIR OWN POA SEMPICES WHISH THEY MAKE THEIR OWN FOOD
11773,IT HAS ALL THREE THINGS WATER AIR AND SUNSHINE,THAT HAS ALL THREE THINGS WATER AIR IND SUNSH
11774,I THINK ANYTHING ELSE TO POINT OUT TO ME IS LIKE WHEN THE YEAST KIND OF LIKE RISES FROM THE BREAD EXCEPT IT GETS IT PUFFY FOR THE AIR OR CARBON DIOXIDE THAT FLOWS IN THE BAG,I THINK UHM ANYTHING ELSE TO POINT OUT TO ME IS LIKE WHEN THE EAST KIND OF LIKE RISES FROM A BREAD EXCEPT IT GETS A PUFFY FOR THE CAR LIKE AIR OR CARD Y OSI THAT FLOWS IN THE BA
11775,YES IT CAN BECAUSE IF IT DOESN'T HAVE ANY SUNSHINE IT WILL TURN LIKE FIRST DAY IT WILL TURN TAN THEN IT WILL TURN YELLOW NOT GREEN,YES IT CAN BE CAUSE UHM IF IT DOESN'T HAVE ANY SUNSHINE IT WILL TURN LIKE UM FIRST DAY IT WILL TURN TAN THAT IT WILL TURN YELLOW NOT GRE
11776,IT'S ALL HEALTHY AND BECAUSE IT HAS ALL THREE THINGS WATER AIR AND SUNSHINE,IT'S ALL HEALTH YAND NEW TREE BECAUSE IT HAS ALL THREE THINGS WATER AIR IND SUNSHI
11777,WHAT I OBSERVE IS LIKE LITTLE TINY PARTICLES INSIDE THE YEAST WHEN IT'S LIKE KIND OF LIKE MIXED WITH THE WATER,WHAT I OBSERIVE IS LIKE LITTLE TIDY PARTICLES INSIDE THE EAST WHEN ITS LIKE  LIKE MIXED WITH THE WATER
11778,IT'S A HOUSE,IT'S A HOUS
11779,WHAT'S IMPORTANT ABOUT PRODUCERS IS BECAUSE THEY MAKE THEIR OWN FOOD AND ONCE A CONSUMER COMES BECAUSE THEY CAN'T MAKE THEIR OWN FOOD THEY HAVE TO EAT SOMETHING THAT'S WHY THEY EAT THE PRODUCERS,WHAT'S IMPORT ABOUT PRODUCERS IS BECAUSE UHM THEY MAKE THER OWN FOOD AND THEM WANTS A CONSUMER COMES BECAUSE UHM THEY CAN'T MAKE THEIR OWN FOOD THEY HAVE TO EAT SOMETHING THAT'S WHY THEY THE PREODUCERS
11780,THAT MEANS IT'S A ALL AND HEALTHY PLANT,THAT MEANS IT'S A ALL NEW TRADED AND HEALTHY PLANT
11781,IT'S BECAUSE THEY NEED LIGHT ENERGY CARBON DIOXIDE AND WATER SO ALL THOSE THINGS SO IT CAN PRODUCE IT'S OWN FOOD WITHOUT THOSE THREE THINGS IT CAN NOT GROW,IT'S BECAUSE THEY NEED LIGHT ANDETY CAM TY ESIDE AND WATER SO ALL THOSE TRINK SO UHM IT CAN PRODUCE IT'S OWN FOOD WITHOUT THOSE THREE THINGS IT CANNOT GROW
11782,THERE IS ONE OF LIKE PARALLEL THERE IS THAT IS PALMATE AND THERE'S ONE THAT IS PARALLEL,THERE IS ONE OF LIKE PARLELL THERE IS ONE THAT IS PALLMA AND THERE'S ONE THAT IS PARLLEL
11783,SOME EXAMPLES ARE SIMPLE LEAF PARALLEL LEAF AND PALMATE LEAF,SOME EXAMPLES ARE SIMPELIEF PAILALIEF AND POLLMTLEAF
11784,I THINK THE VEINS ARE FOR LIKE THEY ALSO USE LIKE THE BLOOD WHICH IT PUMPS IN KIND OF LIKE THE HUMAN BODY'S VEINS,I THINK THE VAINES ARE FOR LIKE UHM THEY ALO USE LIKE THE BLUD OF WHICH IT PUMPS IN KIND LIKE THE HUMAN BODYES VAINS
11785,I'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT VEINS FROM LEAVES AND FROM SAP FROM TREES AND ALSO SOME OTHER STUFF FROM SCIENCE,I'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT VAINS FROM LEAVES IN FROM SAP FROM TREES AND ALSO SOME OTHER STUF FROM CIENCE
11786,ONE IS CALLED SIMPLE ANOTHER IS PALMATE AND THE THIRD ONE IS PARALLEL,ONE IS CALLED SIMPLE ANOTHER IS PALMA AND THE THIRD ONE IS PARLELL
11787,I THINK IT COMES FROM THE AIR CAUSE KIND OF LIKE FROM THE CLOUDS IT GIVES LIKE WATER OUT ONCE IT RAINS SO I THINK THAT'S WHY,I THINK IT COMES FROM THE AIR CUES KINDOF LE FROM THE CLOUDS IT GIVES LIKE WATER AT ONCE IT RAINS SO I THINK THAT'S W
11788,IT IS THE PATTERN OF THEIR VEINS AND ALSO THE OUTSIDE SHAPE WHICH IT WAS BORN WITH,IT IS THE PATERN OF THER VAINS AND ALSO THE OUTSIDE SHAPE WHICH IT WAS BORN WITH
11789,THAT TELLS ME THAT IT IS A SIMPLE LEAF,THAT TELLS ME THAT IT IS A SIMPLE LIAF
11790,I THINK IT'S A SIMPLE LEAF BECAUSE IT'S KIND OF LIKE HALF AND HALF AND IT'S ALL PARALLEL AND IT'S KIND OF LIKE THE SAME ON HALF,I THINK IT'S A SIMPLELIEVE BECAUSE UHM IT'S KIND OF LIKE HALF AND HALF IN IT'S ALL PAROLELLE ND IT'S KIND LIKE THE SAME ON HAF
11791,I THINK IT IS A SIMPLE LEAF BECAUSE IT'S VEINS ARE GOING KIND OF LIKE A CIRCULAR OUTSIDE DIRECTION,I THINK IT IS A SIMPALLYEF BECAUSE IT'S VAINS ARE GOING K LIKE A SCIRCULER OUTSIDE DIRECTION
11792,HOW IT GETS IT'S NUTRIENTS AND THAT'S GETTING OUT OF IT KIND OF LIKE THE CARBON DIOXIDE IT'S BREATHE I MEANT SORRY THE OXYGEN IT'S BREATHING OUT,HOW IT GETS ITS NEW TREANS AND THE LIUMS THAT'S GETTING OUT OF IT KIND OF LIKE THE  UHM CARAN DIOXIDE IT'S BREETH I MEANT SORY THE OXYGEN IT'S BREATHING OUT
11793,I THINK IT WAS SOMEBODY THAT PUT A GUY A BAG AND POURED WATER IN IT OR MAYBE IT WAS JUST RAIN,I THINK IT WAS SOMEBODY THAT UHM UHM PUT A GOT A BAG AND PURED WATER IN IT OR MAYBE IT WAS JUST RAIN
11794,IT IS THE AIR AND WATER I SEE LIKE PARTICLES OF AIR AND PARTICLES OF WATER,IT IS THE AIRIN WATER I SEE LIKE PARTACLES OF AIR AND PARTACLES OF WATER
11795,LIKE THE PHLOEM IS LIKE GOING DOWN IN THE PLANT LIKE IT'S NUTRIENTS AND PROBABLY THAT KIND OF LIKE THE OXYGEN THAT'S COMING OUT OF IT,LIKE THE FOULLEM IS LIKE GOING DOWN IN THE PLANT LIKE IT'S NEW TREEANS AND PROBABLY EXCELIN THAT UHM LIKE KIND OF LIKE THE OXYGEN THAT'S COMING OUT OF IT
11796,I AM DOING GOOD TODAY,I AM NOT DOING GOOD TODAY
11797,THAT IT HAS LIKE DIFFERENT THINGS LIKE LIKE THE NUTRIENTS GO INSIDE AND THEN SOMETHING ELSE GOES OUTSIDE OF IT,THAT IT HAS LIKE DIFFERENT THINGS LIKE UHM LIKE THE NEW TRANS GO INSI AND THEN SOMETHING ELSE GOATS OUTSIDE OF IT
11798,THE ESOPHAGUS IT DOES THAT PUSHES ALL THE FOOD DOWN INTO THE STOMACH,THE SOPFICT GIES IT DOES UHM THAT IT PUSHES ALL THE FOOD DOWN INTO THE STUMICK
11799,MOUTH THE MOUTH USUALLY JUST CHEWS IT AND SWALLOWS IT,MOUTH THE MOUTHE USUALLY JUST CHOSE IT AND UHM UHM SWALLOWESE IT
11800,OH IT IT PUSHES DOWN ALL THE CHEWED UP FOOD LIKE IT LIKE THOSE LITTLE BITS SO IT COULD LIKE FIT THROUGH THAT KIND OF LIKE LITTLE TUBE OF THE ESOPHAGUS,OH  IT UHM PUSHES DOWN ALL THE TUED UP FOOD UHM LEKE IT LIKE THOSE LITTLE BITS SO IT COD LIKE UM FIT THROUGH THAT K LIKE LITTLE TUB OF THE SOFIGURS
11801,I SEE,I S
11802,JUST TO USUALLY JUST TO BREAK DOWN THE FOOD AND ONCE YOU'RE HUNGRY YOU EAT SOME SO IT WON'T GO KIND OF LIKE HUNGRY FOR A LITTLE BIT,JUST O USALLY JUST UHM BREAK DOWN THE FOOD AND ONCE YOU'RE HUNGRY YOU EAT SOME SO IT WON'T GO UHM KINDI HUNGRY FOR A LITTLE BIT
11803,I THINK WHAT'S FOR THE MUSCLE CELLS IS LIKE THEY HELP YOUR MUSCLES GROW OR SOMETHING OR I THINK THEY'LL HELP YOU MOVE IT,I THINK WHAT'S FOR THE MUSSCLE SELVES IS LIKE OF THE HELP YOUR MUSCLES LIKE GROW OR SOMETHING OR I THINK THE'LL HELP YOU MOVE IT
11804,THEY ARE PROBABLY MADE OUT OF MEAT,THEY ARE PROBABLY MADE OUT OF MEATS
11805,LIKE IN A DIGESTIVE SYSTEM IT HAS TO HAVE LIKE SOME KIND OF CELLS CAUSE MAYBE LIKE THE SALIVA THAT'S BEEN IN YOUR MOUTH ONCE YOU EAT IT MAYBE THOSE CELLS KIND OF LIKE BREAK IT DOWN,LIKE IN THE DIJUSTIF SISTOM IT HAS TO HAVE LIKE SOMEKIND OF SELVES CAUSE MAYBE LIKE THI SALIVA THAT SPIN YOUR MOUTH ONCE YOU EAT IT MAYBE THOSE SELVES KINDOF LIKE BREAKE IT DOWN
11806,THINK THE LEAF HAS LIKE A TON OF,I BELEAVE HAS LIKE A TUN
11807,THERE ARE LIKE ALL SORTS OF CELLS AND MAYBE THEY CARRY THE NUTRIENTS FOR THE ARM SO THE SKIN'S HEALTHY,THEY ARE LIKE ALL SORTS OF SELES AND MAYBE THEY CARY THE NEW TREEANS FOR THEIR ARMS SO THE SKINS HEALTHY
11808,DOING GOOD,DOING GOOD
11809,THEY USUALLY JUST BREAK DOWN THE FOOD WHICH YOU EAT WHEN YOU'RE HUNGRY,I USEALLY JUST BREAK DOWN THE FOOD WHICH YOU EAT WHEN YOU'RE HUNGRY
11810,I THINK WHAT THEY ARE IS LIKE SOME KIND OF LIKE NUTRIENTS THAT HELP THE SKIN LIKE STAY LIKE HEALTHY AND STAYS SMOOTH,I THINK WHAT THEY AR IS LIKE UHM SOME KIND OF WIKE NEW TREEANS THAT HEALTH THA SKIN LIKE STAY LIKE HEALTHY AND STAS SMOOTH
11811,IT'S TRYING TO SHOW ME THOSE BRAIN CELLS,IT'S TRYIN TO SHOW ME THOSE BRAN BRAIN SELLVS
11812,WHAT THE MOUTH DOES IS ONCE YOU CHEW IT GOES DOWN INTO YOUR BODY INTO THE STOMACH,WHAT THE MOUTH DOES S WHEN ONCE YOUCHEW IT GOES DOWN INTO YOUR BODY INTO THE STUMICK
11813,WHAT I NOTICE ABOUT IT IS A HUMAN BODY AND I THINK IT'S POINTING TO CERTAIN THINGS WHERE THE CELLS ARE FOR MOST IMPORTANT STUFF,WHAT I NOTICED ABOUT IS A HUMAN BODY AND I THINK IT'S POINTING UHM TO STURT AND THINGS WHERE THE SELLVES ARE FOR MOST IMPORTANT STUFF
11814,I THINK THE BUTTERFLY HAS CELLS BECAUSE IT NEEDS SOME KIND IF THING LIKE IT LIKE SUCKS UP POLLEN,I THINK THE BUTTERFLY HEUSCLES BECAUSE UHM IT NEEDS SOME KIND OF THING LIKE IT LIKE LOOKS UP POLLEN
11815,WHAT IT TELLS ME IS LIKE THERE'S LIKE HUGE CELLS AND LIKE THERE'S LESS CELLS IN A LEAF BECAUSE THEIR ALL ALL THE CELLS ARE IN ONE SECTION,WHAT IT TELLS ME IS LIKE THERES LIKE HUGE SELVES AND LIKE THERE'S LES SELVES IN A LEAF BECAUSEERE ALL ALL THE SELVES ARE IN ONE SECIO
11816,I SEE ALL SORTS OF CELLS AND I SEE SOME VEINS PLUS I SEE THE SKIN,I SEE ALL SORTS OF SELLVS AND I SEE SOME VAINS PLUS UHM I SEE THE SKIN
11817,IT USUALLY JUST USUALLY JUST PUSHES IT DOWN INTO THE STOMACH THAT'S PROBABLY WHICH I ALL KNOW,IT USUALLY JUST USUALLY JUST PUSHES IT DOWN INTO THE STUBIC THAT'S PROBABLY WHICH I ALL KNOW
11818,THEY ARE THEY ARE ALL SORTS OF CELLS,THEY THEY ARE ALL SORTS OF SELVES
11819,THEY BOTH DRINK,THEY BOTH DRAN
11820,LIKE IT'S KIND OF LIKE ALL IN THE DIGESTIVE SYSTEM LIKE ALL OVER YOUR BODY LIKE SOMEHOW IT COULD LIKE BREAKS IT DOWN OR HAS A CERTAIN JOB TO DO FOR THE WHOLE BODY,LIKE IT'S KIND OF LIKE ALL IN THE DIJEUSTIVES SISTOM LIKE ALL OVER YOUR BODY LIKE SOMEHOW IT CA LIKE BREAKES IT DOWN OR HAS A SCURTEN JOBE TO DO FOR THE WHOLE BODY
11821,I NOTICE THAT WHAT THIS IS SIMILAR TO THEM THAT THEY HAVE CELLS,I NOTICED THAT UM WHAT THIS IS SIMILLER TO THEM THAT THEY HAVESELVES
11822,I THINK WHAT IT'S TRYING TO SHOW US IS LIKE ONCE YOU EAT IT WHERE IT GOES THROUGH AND HOW LIKE THE STEPS WHERE IT GOES THROUGH TO BREAK DOWN ALL THE FOOD AND THEN YOU PEE IT OUT,I THINK WHAT IT'S C TRYING TO SHOW US IS LIKE WHE UHM WHENCE YOU EAT IT WHERE IT GOES THROUGH AND HOW LIKE THE STEPS WHERET GOES THROUGH TO BREAK DOWN ALL THE FOOD AND THEN YOU PEE IT OUT
11823,I SEE LIKE SHAPES KIND OF LIKE A AND MAYBE THERE WILL BE ALL SORTS OF CELLS KIND OF LIKE A TO TELL LIKE MESSAGES TO THE BODY,I SEE LIKE SHAPES KINDOF LIKE OF SPARKS AND MAYBE THERE'LL BE ALL SORTS OF SELVES KINDOF LIKE A MOVINT TO TELL LIKE MESSAGES TO THE BO BODY
11824,I THINK WHAT THE MUSCLE CELLS ARE LIKE THEY HELP YOUR MUSCLES MOVE,I THINK WHAT THE MUSCILE SELVES ARE LIKE THEY HELP YOUR MUSCLES MOVE
11825,I THINK THEY ARE BECAUSE THEY BOTH HAVE BLOOD INSIDE OF EACH OTHER,I THINK THEY ARE BECAUSE THEY BOTH HAVE BLOUD INSIDE OF EACH OTHER
11826,I THINK THIS WAS TRYING TO SHOW IS KIND OF LIKE THE YEAST IS KIND OF LIKE THE SKIN OF A HUMAN BODY,I THINK IT WAS TRYING TO SHOW HIS KY LIKE THE AST IS KY LIKE THE SKIN OF A HUMAN BODY
11827,BUT I ALSO KNOW IS JUST TRAVELS ALL ALONG WITH THOSE CELLS LIKE WITH THE FOOD HOW LIKE SIDE BY SIDE OR LIKE IN A LINE OR SOMETHING,BUT I ALSO KNOW IS JUST TRAVELS ALL ALONG WITH THOS SELVES LIKE WITH THE FOOD LIKE SIDE BY SIDE OR LIKE IN A LINE OR SOMETHING
11828,THAT IT HAS ALL CELLS BECAUSE IT'S A LIVING ORGANISM,THAT IT HAS ALL SELES BECAUSE IT'S A LIVING ORGONISOM
11829,I THINK WHAT THOSE BRAIN CELLS LIKE THEY LIKE SEND MESSAGES TO THE BODY LIKE LIKE TELL THE HAND TO MOVE,I THINK WHAT THOSE BRAIN SOS LIKE THE UHM LIKE SEND MESSAGES TO THE BODY LIKE UHM LIKE TILL THE HAND TO MOVE
11830,IT'S THE GASTRIC JUICE IN THE ACID,IS SAGASTIC JUCE IN THE ASID
11831,THE SKIN CELLS ARE FOR LIKE YOUR SKIN SO THEY STAY HEALTHY,THE SKIN SELVES ARE UR LIKE YOUR SKIN SO THEY STAY HEALTHY
11832,I THINK THEY'RE BOTH DIFFERENT CELLS BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT WORKING FOR LIKE LIKE YEAST CELLS ARE NOT WORKING FOR HUMAN CELLS,ITH THE'RE BOTH DIFFERENT SELVES BECAUSE UHM THEY'E NOT UHM WORKING FOR LIKE UHM LIKE UHM EAS SHELLVES ARE NOT WORKING FOR HUMAN SELVES
11833,I'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT THE DIGESTIVE SYSTEM AND ALSO I'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT LIKE HOW IT WORKS THROUGH YOUR BODY,I'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT THE DIJUSTIF SISTOM AND ALSO I'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT LIKE UHM HOW IT WORKS UHM THOU YOUR BODY
11834,IT WAS IMPORTANT BECAUSE THEY HAVE TO BE GOOD IN HAVE TO PUT IN GOOD AND IF IF THEY'RE NOT WELL DONE THEY CAN BREAK,IT IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE I HAVE TO BE GOODEN TY HAVE TO PUT IN GOOD AND IF IF THEY'RE NOT WELL THEM THEY CAN BREAK
11835,I THINK WHAT I WOULD LIKE TO TEST IS SEEING SEEING HOW FAR IT GOES AND SEEING THE LI THE BLOCK CAN GO BE HEAVIER,I THINK WHAT I WOULD LIKE TO TEST AS SEYING SEING HOW FAR IT GOS AN SEING THE LITTLE THE BLACK CAND GO BE HAVIER
11836,I THINK IT'S,THANK YOU TO MOY
11837,WE HAVE SEEN A FLIPPER SYSTEM,WE HAVE SENOGH O PERSISTOM
11838,GOOD BYE,GOODBYE
11839,YOU NEED A SOMETHING TO MAKE IT FLIP YOU NEED YOU NEED A STICK AND TO MEASURE IT,YOU NEED A SOMETHING TO MAKE IT FLIP YOU NEED YOU NEED A STICK AND TO MEASURE IT
11840,I THINK YOU WOULD JUST BY UM FOR EXAMPLE YOU CAN SAY THE BROOK HOLDS THE STICK IN AND IT MAKES IT AND YOU MEASURE IT AND IT MAKES IT GO IN,I THINK YOU WOULD DESCRIBE IT BY UM FOR EXAMPLE YOU CAN SAY THE BROK CULDS THE STICKEN AND IT MAKES IT AND YOU MEASUR IT AND IT MAKES IT O
11841,IT MAKES IT A SYSTEM BECAUSE THE PROPELLER'S SPINNING AROUND,IT MAKES AT A SISTAM BECAUSE THE PERPELLOR IS SPIING AROUND
11842,I THINK WE HAVEN'T,I THINK WE HAVEN
11843,WE HAVE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT FLIPPERS AND WE HAVE BEEN YEAH WE HAVE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT FLIPPERS,WEU HAVE BEN LEARNING ABOUT FLUPPERS AND WE HAVE BEN YU HO WOU HAVE BEN LEARN ABOUT FLUP
11844,I THINK WHAT YOU CAN CHANGE YOU CAN,DO  HEAVIR B BLOCK TO SEE IF IT GOS FARTHER
11845,I THINK WHAT THAT IS ALL ABOUT IS MEASURING IT AND SEEING HOW FAR IT GOES,I THINK WHAT THAT IS ALL ABOUT IS MEASURING  AND SEEING HOW FAR IT GOS
11846,I THINK WHAT'S GOING ON THERE IT MAKES A GOOD FLIPPER SYSTEM BECAUSE IT BOUNCES OFF AND IT HOLDS IT TIGHT AND YOU DON'T WANT TO BOUNCE IT OFF THAT HIGH BECAUSE THE THE STICK CAN BREAK,I THINK WHAT'S GOING ON THERE IT MAKES IA FLIPER SISTOM BECAUSE IT BOUNDS IS OF AND IT HOLDS IT TIGHT AND YOU DNON'T WANT TA BOUND IT OF THAT HIGH BECAUSE IT IT SICK CAN'T BREAK
11847,I'M VERY GOOD,AND VERY GOOD
11848,YOU CAN ALSO UM DO A SMALLER STICK AND SEE YEAH YOU CAN DO THAT TOO,YOU CAN NOL SOLU DO A SMALTHER STICK AND TO SEE AT OU CAN DO THAT TOO
11849,WHEN YOU CLICK IT IT BOUNCES OFF,WHEN YOU CLICK IT IT BOUNCE  SAW
11850,THESE ARE ALL ABOUT MEASURING HOW FAR THE BROOK GOES AND SEEING IF IT GOES THAT FAR,THESE OBJECTS ARE ALL ABOUT MEASURING HOW FAR THE BROKOLS AND SEEING IF IT GOS THAT FAR
11851,I FOUND OUT THAT YOU GET YOU'RE MEASURING IT AND THAT YOU'RE SEEING HOW FAR THE BROOK GOES AND IF IT DOESN'T GO THAT FAR YOU PUT THE CAPACITY YOU WRITE THE CAPACITY AND YOU,I'V FOUND OUT THAT YOU GET YOU'RE MEASURING  AND THAT YOU'RE SEING HOW FAR THE BROOKEOS AND IF IT DOESN'T GO THAT FAR IT PUT THE COPASITY YOU R AT THE COPASITY AND YOU
11852,UM YOU CAN FLIP,YOU CAN DO THIS EXPEROIMENT YOU CAN DO
11853,UM YOU CAN THINK OF,UHM YOU CAN THINK OF
11854,I THINK WHAT THE BASE IS ALL ABOUT IS MEASURING IT AND LIKE SEEING IF IT GOES FAR,I THINK WHAT THE BASES ALL ABOUT IS MEASURING IT AND LIKE SEEING IF IT GOS FAR
11855,I THINK WHAT IS UP WITH THAT OBJECT WOULD BE UM SEEING HOW FAR IT GOES MAYBE,ND I THINK WHAT IS UP WITH THAT OBJECT WOULD BE UHM SEEING HOW FAR  GO MAYBE
11856,UM YOU CAN THE BLOCK THAT HOLDS THE STICK IT CAN BE SMALLER OR IT CAN BE HEAVIER,UMYOU CAN THE BLOCK THAT HOLDS THE STICK IT CAN BE SMALLER OR IT CAN BE HEAVIER
11857,THERE IS SOMETHING ON THE ON TOP OF IT AND THAT YOU HOLD IT YOU PUT IT UNDER THE BLOCK AND YOU JUST FLIP IT AND YOU SEE HOW FAR IT GOES,THERE IS SOMETHING ON  HE ON THE TOP OF IT AN THE YOU HOLD IT YOU PUT IT UNDER THE BLOCK AND YOU JUST FLIPP IT AND YOU SEE HOW FAR IT GOS
11858,IT CONNECTS IT BY PUTTING THE STICK ON THE BOTTOM OF THE BRICK AND IF IT GOES FAR YOU JUST PUSH IT IN YOU JUST TAKE IT OUT AND IT'S AND THEN JUST PUT IT,IT CONNEX IT BY PUTING THE STICK ON THE BOTTOM OF THE BRICK AND IF IT GOS FAR YOU JUS PUSH ITEN YOU JUST TAKE IT OUT AND ITS AND THEN JUST PUT IT
11859,SPINNING THE RUBBERBAND AROUND AND SEEING HOW HOW FAR IT GOES,I THINK IT IS ALL ABOUT
11860,SYSTEMS ARE ALL ABOUT MEASURING AND DOING SEEING SEEING WHAT HOW THE SYSTEM LOOKS,SISTEMS ARE ALL ABOUT MEASURING AND D SAYING SEING W HOW THE SISTOM LOOKS
11861,WHAT'S GOING ON WITH THAT IS THAT WE HAVE TO LEARN ABOUT PENDULUMS WE HAVE TO LEARN HOW TO P HOW TO DO SCIENCE AND AND TO LEARN MORE THINGS,WAS GOING ON WITH THAT IS THAT WE HAVE TO LEARN ABOUT PENDLUMS AN WE HAVE TO LEARN HOW TO P HOW TO DO SCIENCE AND AND TO LEARN MORE THINKS
11862,NO SOME OF THEM HOLD TEN OR NINE,NOW SOME OF THEM HOLD TEN OR NINE
11863,VERY WELL,'S VERY WELL
11864,YOU CAN BUILD THEM OUT OF LIFEBOATS YOU CAN BUILD THEM OUT OF WOOD,YOU CAN BUILD THEM UD OF LIFE BOADTS YOU CAN BUIL THEM MUD OF WOOD
11865,LEARN ABOUT O,RIN ABOUT L
11866,I I THINK I'M NOT SURE I THINK YOU HAVE TO MEASURE THIRTY CENTIMETERS ON THEM AND WE LEARNED HOW TO HOW MANY PENDULUMS THAT IT CAN HOLD AND HOW MUCH WATER IT CAN HOLD,I I THINK I'M NOT SURE I THINK HAVE THE MASER THIRTY SENTMEORS ON THEM AND WE LEARND HOW O HOW MANY PENDLUMS THAT IT CAN HOLD IN HOW MUCH WATER IT CAN HOLD
11867,ABOUT ELEVEN AND C COULD HAVE TEN AND THE SHORTEST ONE COULD HAVE EIGHT,ABOUT ELEVEN AN SEE COULD HAVE TEN AND THE SHIRTEST ONE COULD HAVE EAIGHT
11868,I THINK IT COULD CONNECT TO THE CAPACITY OF THE BOAT WOULD BE WE CAN JUST MEASURE MEASURE EM AND IT CAN BE EIGHTY MILLIMETERS OR SIXTY TWO MILLIMETERS THIRTY EIGHT FIFTY FIVE MILLIMETERS,I THINK IT CI CANNECT O THE COPASKETE OF THE BOA WOULD BE WE CAN JUST MEAGURE MEGURE IM AND IT CAN BE EIGHT MILLIMETERS OR SIXTY TWO MILLIMETERS THIRTY EIGHT FIFTY FIVE MILLIONETERS
11869,BYE,BY
11870,I'VE BUILT MINE OUT OF PA OUT OF PAPER CUPS,I BUILDT MINE OUT OF PAITE OUT OF PAPER COUPT
11871,FIRST YOU HAVE TO MEASURE A THE BOAT AND SEE AND PUT IT IN THE WATER AND YOU I THINK YOU MEASURE THIRTY CENTIMETERS ON THEM AND THEN YOU'D NEED TO,FIRST YOU HAVE TO MEGURE UP THE BOAT AND SEE AND PUT IT IN THE WATER AND YOU D THINK YOU' MEASURED THIRTY SENS AND MEUS ON THEM AND THEN YOU NEED TO
11872,WHY I THINK THEY GOT A DIFFERENT NUMBER OF PENNIES IS BECAUSE THEY CUTTED THEM SHORTER OR LONGER,WHY I THINK THEY GOT IAT DIFFENT NUMBER OF PITES BECAUSE THEY CTAT THEM SHOURTER OR LONGER
11873,I WOULD THINK ABOUT PUTTING PENNIES IN IT OR WATER,I WOULD THINK ABOUT PUTTING PENIES IN IT OR WATER
11874,I DISCOVERED THAT THE BOAT CAN FIT TWELVE TWELVE PENDULUMS IN THE LITTLE BOAT,I DISCOVERED THAT THE BOAT CAN FIT TWELVE TELVE PENDALUMS ON IN THE LITTLE BOAT
11875,WHEN I WHEN I NOTICED THAT A WASN'T DROWNING THAT MUCH I STARTED PUTTING MORE AND MORE UH PENDULUMS IN EM AND WHEN I DROWNED IT I I GOT MY ANSWER REALLY EASILY,WHEN I WHEN I NOTICED THAT A WASN'T DROUNING THAT MUCH I STARTED PARTING MORE AND MORE PENDLMS AND HIM AND WHEN I DROUNDED I I GOT MY ANSER REALL EASILY
11876,WE HAVE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT BOATS AND WE HAVE BEEN PUTTING PENDULUMS IN THE BOATS AND SEEING HOW MANY PENDULUMS CAN FIT INSIDE THE LITTLE BOAT,WE HAVE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT BOATS AND WE HAVE BEEN PUTTING PENDALUMS IN THE BOATS AND SEING HOW MANY PENDALUMS CAN FAHTE INSITE THE LITTLE BOAT
11877,WE,WE
11878,THE LIFEBOATS ARE ALL ABOUT YOU GO YOU CAN GO ON A ROMANTIC DATE YOU CAN,UHM GO TO THE RIVER AND GET ON THEN YOU CAN HAVE A PICKNICK IN THEM
11879,WHAT IS GOING ON THERE IS THE PROPELLER IS THE STRING IS MAKING IT BALANCE IT AND IT KEEPS GOING AROUND AND AROUND PROPELLER KEEPS GOING AROUND AND AROUND,WHAT IS GOING ON THERE IS THE PEORPRLOR THE STRING S MICKING AT BALLANSAY AND THE KEEPS GOING AROUND AND AROUND PURPLE THAT KEEPS GOING AROUND AND AROUND
11880,I THINK IT WILL BECAUSE IT HAS TO HAVE MORE POWER ON IT AND IT HAS TO GO UP FARTHER AND I THINK THAT WOULD AFFECT IT,I THINK IT WILL BECAUSE IT HAS TO HAVE MORE POWER ON IT AND IT HAS TO GO UP FARTHER AND I THINK THAT WOULD EFFECT THE
11881,SO IT HAS ALSO BEEN NICE TALKING TO YOU MARTY,S AL IT HAS ALSO BEEN NICE TUCKING TO YOUR MARTY
11882,WHAT WE'VE BEEN DOING IN SCIENCE WE WERE WE HAVE BEEN DOING AIRPLANES WE HAVE BEEN SEEING IS THE AIRPLANE PROPELLER CAN FLY,WE 'VE EVEEN DOING IN SCIENCE WE WOR WE HAVE BEEN DOING AIRPLANGS WE HAVE BEEN SEING IF THE AIRPLANE PERPILLER CAN FLY
11883,THANK YOU,PINKIN
11884,THANK YOU,THANK YOU
11885,I THINK WHEN SETTING UP YOUR MY EXPERIMENT WAS IT WAS TRICKY TO PUT IT TOGETHER BUT IT WORKED REALLY WELL AND,I THINK HENES SETTING UP HERE T MY EXPEREIMENT WAS IT WAS TRICKED TO PUT IT TOGETHER BUT IT WIKED REALLY WELL AND
11886,IT'S GOING VERY WELL MARTY,SGOING VERY WELL MARTY
11887,YOU CAN ALSO CHANGE THE PROPELLER YOU CAN USE FISHING YOU CAN USE FISHING WIRE AND YOU CAN MAKE THE PROPELLER SMALLER YOU CAN MAKE THE THE,YEAH
11888,YOU,OU
11889,OKAY SO HOW MANY SPINS IT TAKES SPINS ARE FORTY FIVE SPINS IT MADE AND THE DISTANCE IS HOW MUCH METER HOW MUCH METERS YOU MEASURE IT,OKASO HOW MANY SPENDS IT TAKES SPENCE ARE FORTY FIVE SPENDS IT MADE IN THE DISTANCE IS HOW MUCH METER HOW MUCH METERS YOU MEASUR IT
11890,SO WHAT THE PARTS OF THE PLANE I USE THE PROPELLER IS MAKING IT SPIN AND THE STRING THE STRAW AND THE STRING IS MAKING IT BALANCE IT,SO WHAT THE PARTS OF THE PLANE ARE USED THE PERPELLOR IS MAKING A SPIN AND THE STRING THE STRAW IN THE STRING IS MAKING A BELLONCE I
11891,I THINK THE KINDS OF THINGS THAT ARE IMPORTANT WHAT MAKES IF FLY IS THE PROPELLER MAKES IT FLY AND THAT THE STRING IS BALANCED AND A AND THAT THE STRAW IS GREAT IS PUT GOOD ON IT,I THINK THE KINDS OF THINGS THAT ARE IMPORTANT WHON MAKES IT FLY IS A PROPROLER MAKES IT FLY AND THAT THE STRING IS BALLONCE AND A AND THAT THE STRAW IS GRA IS P GOOD ON IT
11892,I THINK WHAT THAT IS ALL ABOUT IT MAKES THE PROPELLER SPIN AND IF WE DON'T HAVE THE RUBBER BAND IN THE BOTTOM IT'S NOT GOING TO WORK,I THINK WHAT THAT IS ALL ABOUT IT MAKES THE PEORPELLER SPIN AND IF YOU DON'T HAVE THEMU RUN THE WATER TS LIKE ANA WORK
11893,YOU HAVE TO THE PROPELLER IS ALL ABOUT MAKING THE PROPELLER SPIN,YOU HAVE TO THE PERPELLOR IS ALL ABOUT MAKING THE PERPELLR SPIN
11894,WHEN IT SPINS THE THING ON THE BOTTOM SPINS AROUND TOO WITH IT AND M AND THEN YOU MEASURE HOW MUCH FAR IT WENT,WHEN SPINS THE THING ON THE BOTTOM SPINDS AROUND TO WITH IT AND IM AND THEN YOU MEATERE HOW MUCH FAR IT WENT
11895,I THINK THE NUMBER OF SWINGS ISN'T RIGHT BECAUSE YOU HA ALSO THE STRING HAS TO BE BALANCED AND THE PROPELLER HAS TO BE MOVING,I THINK THE NUMBER OF SWINGS IS I' RIGHT BECAUSE YOU  ALSO THE STRING HAS TO BE BEALLOANS AND THE PORPILLER HAS TO BE MOVING
11896,WITH STRING,STRING
11897,THANK YOU,THANK
11898,MARNIE,T
11899,I THINK WHAT IS IMPORTANT ABOUT THE FLYING LINE IS BECAUSE AND IT ATTACHES TO IT AND IT MAKES IT BALANCE AND IF E YOU DON'T HAVE IT ON THE BOTTOM IT'S GONNA NOT GO THAT FAST,I THINK WHAT IS IMPORTANT ABOUT THE FLY IN LINE I'S BECAUSE I IT ATATCHES TO IT AND THET MAKES IT BALLONCE AND I  YOU DON'T HAVE IT ON THE BOTTOM IT'SA NOT GO THAT FAS
11900,OKAY,K
11901,WHAT YOU CAN ALSO DO WHEN THE PARTS ARE ALL WORKING TOGETHER IS YOU CAN PUT THE STRING INTO THE STRAW AND THEN YOU CAN JUST SWING IT ACROSS AND IT BALANCE IT AND IF IT DOESN'T BALANCE IT'S GOING TO WIGGLE A LOT,WEL YOU CAN ALSO DO WHEN THE PARTS ARE L WORKING TOGETHER IS YOU CAN PUT THE STRING IN WITH A STRAW AND THEN YOU CAN JUST SWING IT ACROS AND T BELLONSI AND IF E DOESEN BELLONCE ES GET A WIG LO
11902,OKAY,K
11903,I THINK THAT IF THE STRING ISN'T BALANCED THAT WELL IT'S NOT GONNA WORK IT'S NOT GONNA SPIN IT'S IT'S IT'S JUST NOT GONNA WORK,I THINK THAT IF THE STRING S N BEALLONCED OT WELL IT'S NOCT ON O WORK IT'S NOT ENOUGH SPIN IT'ST'S IT'S JUST NOCK ON O WORK
11904,YEAH THAT'S IT,THE PERPELLER ON IT AND THEN YOU NEED TO JUST STABLE THE TWO OTHER OTHER UHM
11905,I AM VERY WELL HOW ARE YOU MARNIE,IM MIRE WELL HOW ARE YOU MARDY
11906,I THINK THE OTHER THINGS THAT ARE IMPORTANT WHEN YOU ARE FLYING YOUR PLANE IS THAT IT'S REALLY BALANCED AND IT'S NOT WIGGLING A LOT AND THAT YOUR PROPELLER SPINS,I THINK THEO THER THINGS THAT ARE IMPORTNT WHEN YOU'RE FLYING YU'RE PLAYN IS THAT IT'S REALLY BALNCE AND IT'S NOT WHEN BIGLING A LOT AND THAT YOU PRPELLER SPINS
11907,I THINK THE PROPELLERS ARE ALL ABOUT I AM GUESSING THAT THE PROPELLERS ARE TO KEEP IT BALANCED,I THINK THE PRPELLEORS ARE ALL ABOUT I AM GUESSING THAT THE PERPELLERS ARE TO KEEP IT BALLONE
11908,ME TOO,ME TO
11909,UM WELL MAYBE IT'S YOU HAVE TO PUT THE AIRPLANE HANGING ATTACHED TO A STRING AND YOU HAVE TO SEE HOW IF IT CAN FLY,U WELL MAYBE IT'S YOU HAVE TO PUT THE AIRPLANE HANGING ATATCH TO A STRING ANDYOU HAVE TO SEE HO A FI CAN FLY
11910,BYE IT'S BEEN NICE TALKING TO YOU TOO,BUY IT' SPEND NICE TALKING TO YOU TOO
11911,I THINK HOW I MIGHT AFFECT IT IS BECAUSE THE SECOND ONE ISN'T REALLY WELL DONE AND IF IT GOES UP IT'S GONNA GO BACK DOWN AND THE FIRST ONE IS GONNA KEEP GOING STRAIGHT,I THINK HOW E MIGHT EFFECTT IT IS BECAUSE THE SECOND ONE ISN'T REALLY WELL DOWN AND IF FIT GOLS UP IT'S GONG TO GO BAT TOWN AND THE FIRST ONE I'S GOING TO KEEP GOING STRAIGHT
11912,I THINK IT'S BALANCING IT AND IT'S MAKING THE AIRPLANE FLY,I THINK IT'S BELLONCING IT AND IT'S MAKING THE AIRPLANE FLY
