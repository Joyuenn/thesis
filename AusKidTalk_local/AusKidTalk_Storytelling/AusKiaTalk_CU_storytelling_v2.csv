when they get older they can live on land so juan's frog will get
tadpole that lived that lived in water yeah billy s exclaimed exclaimed
on each sign said
where to put the animals we can put sam's goldfish next
the next sign is fish sam's goldfish have have scales
amphibians
said sue
like turtles
the three set
with the fish grandpa shook his head
the zoo in the city said sue
but they don't have hair or fur
the later that day grandpa came to help the kids he
that's that's good thinking said grandpa
he is going to draw a picture of his favorite animals
it was the first day of summer vacation sue and billy were eating breakfast what can we do today billy asked i don't know
and horses and lions grandpa smiled
baby whales come from their mother's body
at at the end of the day all animals get to th get to go home

and sue my
i know who
our cat fed her kittens milk from the from her own body added sue
painted on one word
that
cats like to eat fish cats at fish do not belong
they they have gills to breathe in water most baby fish
like birds fish and amphibians do
that's what happened when or cat had kittens
a whale is a strange animal
to the work making cages for the the animals
all our friends can bring their pets
reptiles read billy a snake is a reptile so reptiles are animals with no fur wings are feathers so sue
he made
he found sue and billy in the yard
mammals
so mammals have hair and or fur
and scales crocodile turtle and lizards
ellen has
the whale should
we can go to the zoo but the zoo is far away said billy
out they were mammals too
and and mother whales nurse their babies in water they also breathe with lungs
amphibians
from eggs in the water like fish do
when when the first
birds have feathers wings and right eggs they also lay eggs
near the sign that says amphibians said sue
exclaimed
and now it can hop on land or swim in a pond swim in a pond
p
like

s
pretty

pink
weren't
little pink rose
or any pink
why are you looking at me
the
rose
t
the world were white
hard
all of her children
ones
the big round sun
know what to do
one morning a little white rose woke up
at the little
all her
red
a
he started
uhm
bud rosebud
blushed she
hard
all the rose in
said
didn't did not
hmm
very early
after that
any red
says
bud
ones there were only white roses
so hard
sun looking at her
once a long time ago there were no
bu
there
were
and the little white rose
so she looked up
any yellow ones
at him and said
she saw
white rose
all
b
started
in
because you are so
didn't
uhm
thankfully someone was digging a hole
bad as millions of flies i suppose
but just then a man moved into town who played the flute so badly that people would run away screaming
no fly
was the town hero
a big band played as they marched up
to
the tuba and the piano and the clarinet
why don't you
said the police much sheriff sanders
because as bad as the flute sounded it was a lot better than
and had no one
he started shaking the flute to get the flies off and accidentally smashed it into pieces he was very upset at first
in a
lead
his
the noise they couldn't even swat flies anymore
town because they all had such nice teeth
before they knew it the town was filled with flies again
echo in the well that made the flute sound louder
up at
when
don't know why but i feel like i have
scratching a chalkboard with a fork and then
he
it's called cops and robbers
the people of franksville realized that they would
john in jail since he wasn't really breaking any laws so there was nothing the police could do besides every
so he
and
the people in the town decided
begged dr wong
what should they do
a little girl then a fly
sheriff sanders
s
they got tons and tons of flies
in the little town of franksville
don't play your old flute
a well and let him play down there where no one could hear him
it was
didn't that didn't work
the town of franksville
the local scientist dr wong
but soon after that they started to get files
he wasn't called rooster john yet
but just try to imagine someone scratching and
he alway
and no flute problem
and it turned turned out john could play
up and down the main street everyone cheered
reason
oh that's a nice instrument but it's not but it's just not the flute
he and the cats and dogs are trying to chew off their ears
from then on john would wake up
good thing i brought my old flute as a back as back up
so the
the flies hate john's flute playing as much as we do
then they decided to
well i'm sure you you guessed
the flies would land all over people and they couldn't swat it off
in town started make to make milk sour
to play
new was an excellent dentist but his real love was music
look john i've heard you play the clarinet
shaped made a funny made has flute sound fun awful
that they would have to take
hated the sound so much that he threw john in jai
the flies were annoying so he had to swat them as he
the town dentist everybody's teeth were
the stars of the parade they were up on the main float
thought for a second
just
to have
and
when the towns
then some landed on a bunch of people
but there was
and guess what
then they
an ok an ok idea
that's how the flute sounded when this guy played it
the other
he thought that if he made up a new mouthpiece especially shaped
that the bad flute payer player was rooster john
and found water
maybe a poorly played flute doesn't sound that bad
s sanders said just when a little was going good for franksville
no fly problem and no and the flute problem
the flute sounded normal
as they marched
however for some
to keep
play that instead said sheriff sanders
the neighbors are complaining
thousands of crawling flies on them
then he said oh well
and no one had any cavities
it's the flute sounds that
a normal life
so they decided that john could play the flute and everybody else would have to wear earplugs
they had to cover their ears from the horrible sound
windows were breaking and all the cows in
oh no chief
he knew he was the new town dentist
like a rooster
to or else bad things will happen
shaped
multiply
have
then he played the song the police chair sheriff
just kept on playing his flute
everybody loved john since the since he had become
as fast as they could dr wong
at dances dancing to the music they couldn't hear
john were
they couldn't keep john in jail they
i but it was too late john had started playing
t
then a fly landed on someone else
then
john thought there that was
no one could hear anything people were getting into car accidents and everybody looked really silly at dances
gross suddenly the flies flew away
multiply that that times a hundred
franksville was a town that seemed to have a problem after
came up with an idea
that came later
flies
i don't know why
the way his mouth was shaped
at
it was that it was then that
but they couldn't keep
john didn't know what to do
dr wong
it quite well
some then suddenly a fly landed on
the flies away
i even wrote a s you a song
but i have to play i was born to do it
and strings strings of
so there was a problem
no no please
lower him down
john the dentist is driving the flies away
they couldn't swat them off
that
before i tell you how rooster john got his name you should know a little bit about
local
he played many musical instruments such as the guitar
the flute
you're quite good
we can't let you play the flute anymore john
the good with the bad
much whiter and cleaner
with his hand or even his new flute
perhaps he could play the flute normally
they just couldn't
then uhm pronounced
but
when the townsfolk heard the
they didn't want to kick him out of
a great big parade
an
pretty soon tons of flies were landing on everybody
in franksville to celebrate the fact for once there was no problem
it worked dr dr wong
then the flies stopped
i'm i'm serious still i it's not as
for john's mouth
their problems started when they ran out of water

aunt helen said
wind at all
fleabag didn't know what to do because he had been on his leash so long just then snot
fleabag play without the leash since he still
fleabag came he would sometimes get a yummy
because he knew fleabag could never catch him
vet
he was allowed to run so
which means in dog talk why do you have to wear my stupid looking collar
be let off his leash when
s
to lick his legs but there was a big white
that made him
eventually
his back leg and run away saying bark bark bark
one day fleabag went to the vet
which in dog talk means don't you ever miss
sprinted
your
there was a dog park near where he lived he enjoyed playing with the other dogs because he didn't
owed
to see all his friends mean old snot
by then
itched very badly he thought
a puppy
gave him a treat
on
fairly
was walking with his
he
he knew it fleabag ran into
do you look silly in that ugly collar ha ha
he was wearing a collar that made it impossible to lick
it's hard to
bag
when he ran
realize which meant he was
him up and drove him home
the collar
which in dog talk means you're are s too slow to catch me with your limp
vet because unusually the people in the white
its legs then it legs
as usual
he was so happy that he could run fast
gave them big kisses
his back
would always fleabag
there was one dog named snot
bark
allowed
he thought
that
and go to the dog park but he
fleabag
what
owners named him fleabag
the dog park
and took a
needed to
bit him on the back leg and ran away
but suddenly he noticed that fleabag was catching up to him and before
to have s surgery on his legs when he awoke
boy
fleabag started running after snot
which made him
s
thing in his way
limp
fleabag got to take
from the surgery he didn't remember where he was but he sure did want to see his owners soon they came and picked
bark
fleabag didn't mind the v
a little mad at his owners one day he took a walk to the dog park and all his friends were there
miss with me again snot fleabag was able to run faster than he could ever remember
to his owners and gave them a
was a puppy he was older now and had problems with
fleabag
have to be on his leash at the dog park
said bark
all
the legs didn't itch so he didn't want to lick them for six weeks he could take walks
oh
snot was
was very dirty so his
ts
his owners reached around the bag
owners on his leash and they went to
heal but
him and knocked him down and said bark bark bark
ha ha ha
it's hard to s
that was a long time ago when
like most dogs he loved to run
all
it always it was nice
but that didn't stop him from running
fleabag suddenly realized that his legs
off but
coats
so i'm going to pick up
m as
the next day he
very com
legs
would always chase snot but could never catch him
that would always come up to fleabag and bite
it's cause the words are so small and my eyes are so small
bark bark
oh boy i'm going to lick my leg so hard that the itching is going to go away so he turned his head around
he sprained s
couldn't
was at the v
he soon learned that whenever his owner said
la
his owners wouldn't let
his leash off
why i am sorry before i was allowed
b
my toes
i'll bet you didn't know something else
the gerbils
need fur in the winter sometimes i think
just cause she's a good student didn't mean she's really responsible
to the cat to get the cat
and
mrs
if i had a cat i would teach it
and not be cuddle
last night i saw
of
harder each time and soon have an incredible coat
the cat liked being shaved anyway
have shaved it
dad please don't read the next part
by the clippers and shaved herself i kept saying no kitty no don't shave yourself
away all my allowance when i shaved the neighbor's dog
it
plus if you weren't always
that we saw on t v
to making me do this because it wasn't my fault
all that great under pressure and
my sister jenny
know what else to do so i grabbed dad's
see the cat getting all hot and uncomfortable and stuff
dear mom and dad parents
you wouldn't always take the cat's
when we shave it hair it grows back
i'm getting hungry and i'm sorry for shaving the cat
i think that should be brush her teeth twice tonight
i couldn't buy him anything nice since you took
on the animal channel
and get lots of money so that you can send jenny to college even if sh she has
and poor kitty that is your fault really
but so what
cause know i have
actually the truth is that i by accident turned the noise hair clippers and the cat was being chased by the turtle
i would like to start by saying that i think
to make
oh sure it's easy to say that i shouldn't have just picked the cat
and you told us we couldn't hit the animals
i was going to sell the cat fur
plus oscar my turtle told me to shave the cat
besides the real reason i shaved the cat was to keep it nice and cool
she made us save shave something for science ask her
i can get can i get a dog please
that's for sure i don't
that
my father's day to gi
then she would be super cat and you could take her
danny
you guys will just probably say it's winter danny cats don't
the only reason it hasn't come out for two weeks is because you guys made such a big deal about it poor kitty
my own head i can practice by shaving jenny's head
plus i forgot to tell you
a cats get
how to listen she just got ignored she just ignored me
n i know how much you hate him always sneezing and stuff so i thought if i get rid of this f
p s if you have
you would have been with her cat instead
gerbils didn't even
you could
and sometimes even darker so i thought if we could shave
told
did to me poor turtle
though i'll opinion though
you should be proud for
she's good at school and you bought
ok here is what happened as i remember it
would grow fur back but some cats don't
and i'll just
that i shaved the cat though
out of my room i am mad at you
realest reason i shaved the cat was
did you know that i wanted to be a barber i was afraid to tell you a a reason i shaved the cat was i wanted to be a barber and i needed to practice i was afraid if you wouldn't practice
oh sure thinking
i swear that's the reason
did stupid things that's why the last time i shave the cat to protect any stupid gerbils
used to the idea before it got really hot
casper my science teacher
that she didn't brush her teeth oh yeah i forgot to tell you
to to not shave itself
cuddly
of cat fur armor
bitter marriage so it's really m
on m
so don't see the big deal i think it really liked its haircut
sincerely
but my stupid sister never taught her cat
how come
he's always sneezing around it
cuddling with my sister so much maybe
you always s s say and not brushing her teeth
i couldn't help it anyway
and you know what those stupid
braces for her big stupid face
noise hair clippers and shaved it
harder
since you have grounded me and
side if you knew the stuff
that's just my opinion
although you can see it's really jenny's fault for being as responsible as
is a dumb little tattle tale
it was an a accident and i didn't even do it on purpose i really didn't mean to s shave the cat really i swear
i knew our cat
what dad calls life experience not what
if it's winter i mean it'll be summer soon enough
and ran right
dear mom a dear mom don't let dad know that i the real reason i shaved the cat was he always
to know that you should teach a cat to shave itself
a wig for those poor hair l hairless cats
you are very mean
up but sometimes we don't always think
buy
so we didn't
i just wanted to
fine oscar can't really talk but if he could he would said please shave the cat it cat it keeps hitting me on the shell and trying to roll me over
when you leave the room you guys never liked oscar as much as the cat anyway
she said that we
dear mom and dad jenny didn't brush her teeth last night
t c
have to get good grades
on t v shows
father's day gift to him
promise that i'll do a better job then i did the cat cause i know
overheat in the winter
this
should be blame that you should be blaming
a cat and i get stupid turtle anyway turtles don't do anything except poke their heads out
see she's not so responsible after all
a bunch of times hair would grow back
his fur he won't sneeze and you wouldn't have
if you'd have bought her a turtle i couldn't
that cat came into my room because jenny never plays with it enough
thank me they just ran
told me to write down
cat's aren't always nice just like my sister jenny isn't always nice
a cat
thinking so fast on
i'll let
i saw the cat was trying to get
have hair they called hairless cats
her a cat cause she's responsible and stuff
on that stupid wheel
and i just wanted to
it's not so quiet said rita there are lots of sounds they're just not the same kinds of sounds that you hear in new york
ramon said rita p
dad said ramon we have many sizes of bottles
blew
ramon listened he heard a bird singing
around here joked rita
so that's what's been making those odd noises said a voice behind them their mother was standing at the door
our ears send a message to our brain
ramon looked around the porch he saw nothing but some empty bottles i think the house is groaning whispered rita
ramona and rita sat on the back porch of their new home they had moved the country just they moved to the country just two weeks ago ramona still missed the city
rita began to laugh it's not spooky she said it's just
well the air inside the bottle moves back and forth very quickly mom answered these movements are called vibrations
no
i
walked over to the empty bottles on the porch rita followed he picked up a bottle and blew across the top of it
and vibrations make the sounds right asked
when they heard something
everyone looked around where is that awful noise coming from asked mom i never heard a sound like that in new york rita whispered ramon was standing near the fireplace
let's try them said dad each bottle made a different sound
ramon walked over to the empty
several boxes sat at the kitchen floor mom was taking dishes out of one box and putting them away when you blow across the top of a bottle mom explained the air inside the bottle vibrates
it's thunder said mom there must be a storm
she felt silly for thinking
there is more room inside it the air to vibrate a shorter bottle makes a higher sound
the sound stops when the wind stops it starts when the wind blows it's the house that's making the noise i don't like it ramon said rita
tying string onto a kite
as if to prove that they had seen the wind blew again the house groaned
look kids he said i can show you what vibrations are he held a rubber band in his hand dad pulled the rubber band tight between two fingers pull the rubber band rita he said and then let it go
just listen ramona
he heard cowbells ringing from the farm down the road he heard the soft sound of wind blowing through the trees
ramon watched rita pull the rubber band and let go it moved quickly it made a funny sound did you see the rubber band vibrate asked dad it moved back and forth very fast and made it the air around it move very fast the air moving back and forth those movements are vibrations right asked ramon
ramon and rita picked up the bottles and followed their mother into the house
we'd better shut the windows ramon and rita raced to close the windows dad closed the door they finished just in time the wind started blowing harder suddenly the house really did begin to groan
they heard the sound again this time ramon knew it what it was
will they all make different sounds
why does the bottle make that sound mom asked rita
then a new sound filled the room
maybe it's the wind said ramon
and that's how we hear sounds rita picked up a bottle it was shorter than the others she blew it across the top of it that bottle sounds like a whistle said ramon that's right said dad a tall bottle makes a deep sound
he missed their old school he missed playing with his friends on their street rita finished
the chimney the chimney is like a giant bottle when the wind blows over it the air inside vibrates and because it's so tall it makes a really deep sound ramon added i think ramon and rita are right laughed mom
dad came into the room
ramon
there it was that strange sound
told you there were lots of things to hear
strange what was that asked rita i don't know ramon ra
right asked rita mom smiled you're both right she said those vibrations move through the air into our ears mom explained
when they heard the groan again i think it's coming from the fireplace he said the fireplace is making that spooky sound the wind slowed down for a moment then house became quiet again
what does vibrate mean asked ramon
that the house had groaned come inside said their mother we can talk while i work
the wind
it has less room inside for the air to vibrate
what a great day for flying a kite she smiled at her brother just listen to the wind in the trees i hate the country ramona said it's too quiet here
it looked as if neither of them had moved at all
to break this rule would mean an end to the great turtle race forever
they looked at the horizon
swish's father said son i have something to tell you
faster than you
to their little pond
the mayor say runner's please take your positions the slowest turtles from each pond were carried to the starting
to race
the crowd thought he must have realized
festival
race that was the most exciting finish we've ever had
then mud tried
blue pond became
for
the turtle cup to sludge pond again
legends about him
mud didn't answer the mayor tapped mud
everyone thought he was a little slow but as he got a little older the turtles began to realize that swish was really really really slow
rule number four no turtle may fall asleep
without him we don't have a chance but he doesn't want to be treated special he just wants to be normal and he doesn't want everybody to hate him if he can't beat mud
he had ever seen
and all these turtles will know that blue pond rules
they are nice to me now because they think i can win the race but if i lose
started toward great pond
the great race begins at sunrise and ends at sunset
but this time swish was just as slow
for swish they were very proud he gave mud such
there was
the tricks that his
a free shell waxing today
out of the field
than you would have liked
champion in the history of shell dweller's festival
the mayor dr softshell said this is ridiculous
swish
but the main that event was the great turtle race the winner of the great turtle race was so important that he or or she didn't have to move for four years until the next festival
for the first time in six hundred years
he was tired
but he was going to give swish a free
became the greatest he became the greatest and biggest turtle of all time much greater or bigger than mud he always made
every four years turtles from all over the land would crawl to the great pond
the turtle cup again this time it was a bit closer
but swish wouldn't let mud scare him
ladies and gentlemen
swish read the rules even
peek a boo from big puddle village
the turtles all stretched and thought really slow thoughts
we all want you to look good when you bring home the cup mrs s snapper would say
it would take some turtles
at great pond
all turtles must go as fast as they
all the turtles were very very slow
tied and had only moved a few inches
there rise just then the mayor said ready set slow and off they went
swish's ear
mr peeks the local shell cleaner would say
you're going to ruin the great race forever
swish saw a rock in the middle of the field and wondered
his name was mud
once it took him three days just to yawn
for many years since turtles only get
but then right as the end
turtles could catch up with friends they had not seen since the last festival
he started singing a soft beautiful b
he would never lose the turtle cup for the rest of his long life
mrs peeks
the real winner is swish
well mud it looks like
his heart would only beat beat once a day
mud still didn't answer in fact mud was sound asleep
and he didn't make it home until
you are asleep
at be being slow
all having a great time
the were
the race i can't beat mud anyway i heard
him months to get to great pond by himself
rule number three no turtle may pretend to
dis
swish was t happy too but deep down inside he knew he was just as slow as mud
after seven days of playing and dancing and bug eating finally the day of the race ca came the mayor of the great pond miss
he hadn't had to move for over fifty years he was the biggest most respected and also one of the trickiest turtles there was there was
that's not a rock sweetie s said his mom that's mud
what would you like to say
when mud
shell dwellers festival
has heard race he's the slowest turtle i've every seen
swish took the cup that day f for the first time
oh no shouted the fans mud's winning it looks like mud is still the greatest turtle of them all
treated him special
and after a while swish decided that he would be proud to race for his village and the time of the festival
this was the kind of thing that swish would get all the time
mrs t
he reached in his shell and pulled out a couple of earplugs
i'm not going to fall for your tricks he said
so you can see winning the great
and when the sun went down mud was the closest turtle to the starting line
hundred years so with swish they thought maybe just
them by heart
mud said to swish there's no way that a turtle as young
swish's mom smiled and said
swish was suddenly very excited he told his mom s
you down for the big race a fat turtle is a slow turtle
did the sky turned
first ever
most of the turtles had gone a few feet all except two swish and mud
all at all times
they were both moving of course but they were s so slow that it was hardly to tell after six hours mud and swish were still
as you know it your great great grand turtle raced mud once he wasn't as slow as you but he did teach about mud's dirty tricks then you whispered in
the turtle cup was the trophy that the winner would take home in their village
and saw the sun was starting
said swish's mom
when i was your age you're cheating
everyone treated swish differently for example
line by members of their villages
that his singing trick wasn't working
where there was lots of eating and laughing
i think that you'll be a great champion
another trick
this snapper was never nice to anyone but she was being nice to swish
the most respected pond in the land
sleeping during the race this means that we have a new champion
it was r morning he was so slow
there was lots of eating and l
she announced
once his mother called him in for dinner
on the shell and said hello hello mud
you have to remember that even though he's gifted
there were thousands of turtles all of all different s spices
since if
i'm not afraid of stupid mud
there were about three hundred turtles racing
rule number two all turtles must run as fast as they can and the turtle that is closest to the starting line wins
they'll be disappointed and mad at me i never promised that i would win
swish had to be carried on his father's back since it would have taken
mud from sludge pond has been
mud knew that this would be his closest race ever and he was actually getting a little bit scared
great great grand turtle taught him
he was the slowest turtle of all time
a close race
it seems to be in everyone's way to swish
he was unbeatable
hello bet
swish was
started to pull ahead of mud
the less a turtle moves the bigger they get and
i would like to present the turtle cup to blue pond the crowd went wild again
he was tired from racing and thought that it would be nice to just listen to mud's sweet voice and fall asleep
we never thought of that they all said the town agreed to treat swish like a normal turtle
shell waxing
sure that no one
it would take some turtles from far away villages two whole weeks just to get there
then he snapped out of it and remembered his father had warned him of h this trick
you're just trying to make me quit
the longer they live
she said
said swish's mother you'll get to meet all sorts of new turtles
who is this young punk he thought to himself
though he knew
seven
as they
hi swishy do you want some yummy pie to fill you up and slow
so it took some time before anyone could figure out which turtles were the most slowest after a few hours
can
this was swish's
and he was only a foot away
by now all the turtles were usually way ahead of mud
there was the most famous turtle
all
swish was sad that he lost but al all the turtles from blue pond cheered
how come they don't move that big rock
hey there swish do you want
and he was the greatest
so one day he told his parents i don't want to race all the turtles in blue pond held a meeting to discuss the problem
slower with age
but then right at the end right before the sunset
everything about the festival was fun
said swish's father
swish started yawning
but though
would never do anything for free
softbelly of blue pond the crowd went wild
you've done it sludge pond wins
breakfast the next morning
mud had actually sung himself to sleep
look there's your cousin
h he's still very young
you aren't running as fast as you can
blue pond was a nice village located about three days crawl from great pond
every four years turtles from all over the land would crawl to great pond
all the slowest of the slow
be going fast but go slow instead
finally after the long journey all the turtles arrived
there was were many
tort posted the rules of the race on a tree for everyone to see
the mayor of pondland went to present
swish made a loud gulp sound
was in his prime there was a new turtle born in blue pond for the turtle was named swish when swish was born
to all the turtles at the festival the crowd started yelling speech speech
except for mud of course
and he thought it was the most wonderful thing
he would take it many more times after that
i know it
rule number one
and that he treated everybody like he wanted to be treated like a turtle with honor
drew near all the turtles in the land
all the extra attention made swish very uncomfortable he thought sure
ort for went up to swish and gave him the turtle cup she said swish you are the youngest winner of the great turtle
drought dwellers
he put the earplugs on his ears and couldn't hear mud's singing anymore mud kept singing his lullaby for a few hours but he stopped right before sunset
turtles never cheat and i'm a turtle with honor
it was because of swish that
race is a good honor
you know what i'm going to win this race
i know that you can win swish but it's an honor just to get
maybe he could bring back the turtle cup to their pond
then he heard
as you can be so slow even i was
just do your best said his mom
from black to dark blue
since turtles never cheat this is the most important rule
were both back at the starting line
night they camped on the river bank

tricks
it would be nice just to listen to mud's sweet voice and fall asleep
that was the most
i'm not afraid of stupid mud
it looked as if
no one treated him special and
when the time
day for
there were thousands of turtles of all different species
so it look
so you can see winning the great race is a great honor
a they can at all times
the the turtles all stretched and thought
swish
the starting line wins
to swish and gave him the turtle cup
and he was only a foot away
to discuss the problem
all th we never thought of that
a seven day festival called the shell

for with the time in six hundred years i would like to present the turtle cup to blue pond
have a new champion the
to
lose they'll be disappointed and mad at me
finally after the long journey all the turtles arrived at great pond

the earplugs
i'll never i never promised

was the of the trophy that the winner would take take home to their village
s song
he must have realized that his singing trick wasn't working
that big
was never nice to anyone but
the mayor of great pond
over fifty years he was the biggest most
him
slower with age
after six hours mud and swish were still tied
on his father's back since it would have taken him months to get to great pond by himself
the rest of his long life
punk
peek a boo from big puddle village
after a few hours most of the turtles had gone
all turtles must go as fast as
you're you're cheating
by
no turtle may fall asleep since if you're
run as fast as they can
in for dinner and
what you would h you like to say to all the turtles at the festival
a slow turtle
all the turtles in blue pond held
when all the turtles arrived
was the slowest turtle of all time
the sunset went down mud was the closest turtle to the starting line
he doesn't want to be treated special
the great turtle race
he thought sure they are nice to me now because they think i can
deep down inside he knew he he was just as slow as mud
to their little pond
and he was the greatest champion in the history of
the
said son i have something to tell you
said mud try
the field it and wondered
he stopped right before sunset
after seven days of playing and dancing
out of it and remembered his father and warned
had i think that you'll be a great champion for many years since turtles only
they were both moving of course but
the land started toward
you're going to run
pond in the land
actually getting a little bit scared
before anyone could figure out which turtles were
having a great time
since turtles never cheat this is the most important rule
that's not a rock sweetie said his mom
but swish wouldn't let mud scare him you're just trying to make me quit i'm not going to fall for your tricks he said
thoughts as they as they did the sky turned from black
i know that
then he heard the mayor say runner's please take your pos
no turtle may pretend to be going fast but
are you are the youngest winner of
the shell and sa said
and all these turtles will know that
dwellers
wh the town agreed to s treat swish like a normal turtle and after a while swish decided that he would be proud to
or bigger than mud
swish took the cup
blue pond the crowd went wild
you have to remember
the less
ever shell dwellers festival and
mrs snapper would say
to sludge pond again
this turtle was named swish
in his ears and couldn't hear mud's singing anymore
hi swishy
she announced well mud
i would win the race
every four years turtles from all over the land would crawl to
raced mud once he wasn't as slow as you
swish started yawning he was
in
the end be right before the sunset swish started to pull
it seemed to be in everyone's way said swish
except for mud of course without him
but he was going to give swish a free shell waxing
pow
he reached
they all felt a little sad because they hadn't held it the turtle cup in over a
the turtles from blue pond cheered for swish
there were many legends about him
by now all the turtles were usually way ahead of mud
r chapter
all except two swish and mud were still
go slow instead all turtle
must go
even i was faster than you when i was your age
there were carried
that this
no turtle must m
and off they went
rule number two all turtles must
he told his parents i don't want to race
what you
a fat turtle is
hour hours but
once his mother called him
this a was the most famous turtle there was
weeks just to get there
but
ladies and gentlemen
it looks like mud's mud is still the greatest turtle of them all and when
but
they thought maybe just maybe he could bring back the turtle cup
his name was mud and he
he thought sure
but the main event was the
the
a turtle with honor
just then the mayor said ready set slow
swishes father
swish saw a rock in the middle of
but
then he snapped
and then he whispered in swish's ear all the tricks that his great great grand turtle taught him
neither of them had moved at all
exciting finish we've ever
that he treated everybody like he wanted to be treated like a turtle with honor
of the festival drew near all the turtles in
would be his closest race ever and he was
the first time he would take it it many more times after it was because of swish that blue pond became the most respected
all
so it took some time
since turtles that
really slow
set swish read the rules even though he knew them by heart
swish's mom smiled and said
rule number three
i'm going to win this race i know it
the mayor tapped mud on
she said swish
they all said they all said
of all time greater
hate him if he can't beat mud
the real winner is swish softbelly from
the crowd went wild again
today we all want you to look good when you bring home the cup
the turtle cup
when mud was in his prime there was
this was swish's first
for four years until the next festival
promised that
the put doesn't make really sense but the put the earplugs
a new turtle born in blue pond
a soft beautiful lullaby
it had been
grand turtle
said this is ridiculous swish has a r to ra has to race he's the slowest turtle i've every seen
but then right as
rock out of the field
blue pond was a nice village located about three days crawl from great pond
of his of his this trick
swish was sad that he lost but all
respected and also one of the trickiest turtles there was
she was being nice to swish mr peeks would never do anything for free
mrs mrs tort
and had only moved a few inches
rule
he he thought to himself
but thou though he became the greatest and biggest turtle
said swish's mother you'll get to meet all sorts of new turtles swish was suddenly very excited he told his mom you know what
a few feet
they can
members of their villages there were about three hundred turtles racing they were all the slowest of the slow
you are asleep you aren't running as fast as you can
and the turtle that is the closest to
a meeting
and he didn't make it it home until breakfast the next morning
the crowd started yelling speech speech
mrs tort went up
he hadn't
there was a s
we never thought of
he just wants to be normal and he doesn't want everybody
disqualified for sleeping during the race this means that we
this shell dweller's festival he was unbeatable
the mayor of
everyone treated swish differently for example mr peeks
the winner of the great turtles turtle race
win the race but if i
the put
the turtle cup
said then then mud tried another trick he started singing a soft beautiful
as you know th your great
how come they don't have
the crowd thought
himself
and bug eating finally the day of the race came
mr snapper
they were so slow that it was hard to tell
get
ruin the great race forever
the great pond swish had to be carried
who is this young
he would never a lose the turtle cup for
the slowest
look there's your cousin
to break this rule
to dark blue
turtles
that's mud swish m swish m made a loud gulp sound
positions the slowest turtles
you can win swish but it's an honor just to

he did teach about mud's dirty
blue pond rules
hello hello mud
the great turtle race what
festival where there was lots of eating and laughing
race for his village
always m he always made sure that no one
that
all the turtles were very very slow
the less a turtle moves the bigger they get and the longer they live
he thought it was the most wonderful thing he had ever seen
i can't beat mud anyway i heard once it took him three days just to yawn
when swish was born everyone thought he was a little slow but as he got a little older the turtles began to realize
do you want some yummy pie to fill you up
mud kept
it looks like you've done it
sludge pond
at being slow he's still very young and swish's father
tired from racing
a great pond
but he did teach about
we don't have
ahead of mud
mud still didn't answer in fact mud was sound asleep
a seven hundred years
all of h h this his shell
they were very proud he gave
turtles could catch up with friends that hadn't that they had not seen since the last festival
this was the kind of thing that swish would get all the time
pa posted
would mean an end the great turtle race forever
but this time swish was just as slow

he told his parents i don't want any wear those
he even imagined himself as a grown up wearing the hat and speaking in front of many people he imagined the people whispering to themselves what a fine speaker
he
shrink if you wash it and then it will be too small he said
justin was eight and a little too smart for his own good justin was his
hence

com
it totally fit his head he loved the way
his parents looked at each other and knew that justin had learned a good lesson son
his hair
and found the perfect one but from
he the hat

it wasn't
but smile
know it wasn't perfect fit for looking but he knew
if it gets dirty it wasn't
the hat out carefully he slowly slid out
then he noticed that it wasn't
would look at the hat display and imagine himself walking around the school and with the hat on his head once
but it will
since he was so smart
it on the supposed to be before
and his ninth birthday he decided to wear the hat
he got
justin being pretty smart knew that his father needed to know
he thought it was great
he even liked the way
them all and try to find a new perfect hat instead
good he figured that
silver for you own
so justin and his mother went shopping for hats
was roll her eyes
so happy that he couldn't help
even
he opened the plastic box and grabbed
he loved the way it was
some
i don't want
he and is a such a handsome
soon you're
knew crying wouldn't help make the hat perfect again
i promise of you find the perfect hat
justin and his mother went shopping for hats and found the perfect but justin would never
it was like remembering he was so happy could
something was wrong it was a little tight
there were many presents but the only thing that made justin
plaints the on the hat the first time he wore it at school and everyone thought he looked handsome in his hat
know what you're going to say
the
looked when he took the hat off
we would
you should really wear the hat if you like it or else you'll be sorry
get dirty or lost if he wore it too much so he made the promise to himself he would never wear the hat except on special days he wanted
then on justin would never take off
that he didn't like the hat in fact he loved it
i know it's just a hat he thought to himself but i sure love it
but justin didn't listen and everyday but
i'll
justin knew it was perfect anymore
on so he could hear the fabric against his hair
this three toads learned their funny song from him
to a barnyard where we found some feathers from a peacock
she fell to the ground and
they were her very good friends she liked the ducks she could talk with them as much as she liked
she would not even move her mouth she was very happy so the duck got a strong stick and held the ends
the peacocks came into the yard they did not know what to think at first
whom had always
then they came to town people looked up and
and old friends but one of the crows had seen him in the barnyard and had t and told the others how silly he had been acting
said the tortoise the ducks felt bad they had an idea of how to take her we have a way to take you
don't
then he danced back and forth looking
we will not
the two ducks could not live without water they were going to fly away to more water they w
how high we are but she could not talk the stick was in her mouth she kept still they saw a pretty house she wanted to say what is that
peacock feathers and many of his black ones
be quiet but she did not
you take the middle in your mouth then we will fly up in the air with you but do not
in his own
hi
where have you been they cried we know
the tortoise and the ducks lived together for a long time the pond
then the two ducks flew away with their friend
away with the cheat
made eyes at him and screamed cheat
at the ducks carrying a tortoise they said
of a stick
be cheat don't be a be cheat
away away and they drove him away
i will die if i stay here but you can not fly said the ducks how can we take you with us
look they said the tortoise forgot the stick
a lone he lived
said a
this
he picked these up with his bill and placed them
that was the end of the tortoise it is very good to be able to be quiet
the tortoise liked to talk she liked the sound of her voice
the tortoise bit the middle
then they saw the crow was trying to dress and act like they did they flew at him calling
hated
saw them look
they said but you must not move we'll each take one end
don't
at his fine new coat he even tried to walk like a peacock
have you in this flock
went to the tortoise to say goodbye
but she kept quiet
oh don't leave me said the tortoise take me with you
this that is funny look at it
talk if you open your mouth you will fall
he flew into the forest there in a tree by a pond lived
i hate black feathers no matter how shiny said a proud crow i want to be a peacock
feathers then the
is his warning to them
we know
ran out of water the ducks and the tortoise had no water to swim in
they were high over the trees the tortoise wanted to say
away with the cheat they pulled out the
cheat
everyone ran to look the tortoise wanted to say
you w
even the owls
the crow was glad to get away alive but he flew back on to his own family
take me with you take me with you
once upon a time a tortoise lived in a pond with two ducks
the tortoise said she would not say a word
she opened her mouth to say hush
he flew away
a lonely life
white thing
reached out around his neck and took off his leash just then
he went to his owner the dog he went with his owners to the dog park
costumes gave him treats racer didn't know it but
day on fang never bit racer's leg racer was so happy that that he could
when
soil by an astronauts boot it looked li like a the prints of a big tennis shoe the soil looked like dirty sand altogether there were six apollo missions or trips to the moon between nineteen sixty nine and nineteen seventy two terry said
kissing and hugging her good bye that they hadn't noticed the very mysterious man who had boarded
after lunch the man pushed his seat back and took a nap christina took his chance to glance at the pad it read return the moon by return the moon by tuesday
so much for your mystery said mark that's part of it were clearing up the man on the plane had something to do with n a s a and probably worked with the moon samples but i still
he was at the vet to have surgery to fix his legs
imagination was overactive
as a puppy all he wanted his to do was run and run
his f and g gave them big kisses for fixing his legs
i is it the n a s a johnson space center she works near the lu lu lunar sample exhibit
christine christy had never met anyone in los angeles who wore two watches
scientist learn about how the moon formed and and changed over billions of years
f
fang was laugh laughing because he knew racer could never catch him but suddenly he noticed that racer was catching up to him racer was running faster than he could ever remember before he knew it he had caught
saying bark bark bark bark which in dog means y you are too slow to catch me with a limp of yours so i'm going to pick on you racer would always chase fang but he could never catch him one day racer went to the vet racer liked
when a mysterious man left his seat christine noticed he had dropped a photograph she looked at it and saw that the man had already left christina put the photograph in her pocket u
sure it sure does look silly
you wouldn't want me to call my family in the middle of
there was something and very mysterious going on spring vacation to and was always very exciting but this one was more exciting than usual
then when he got older he
that the itching is go
he was wearing a collar that made
run s so racer started running and chasing fang
and ran and ran in circles finally he ran back to his owners
since he still needed to heal from surgery
terry is training to be an astronaut i'm sure i saw it it on in one of her books well
well said terry for one thing rocks very old about the same age as the oldest rock in earth
he enjoyed playing at the dog park because he didn't have to be on his leash when he was there so he could run as much as he liked there was one dog at the park named fang
it
and that sitting right next to her
return the moon
her wild stories would get her into trouble this
on the drive home racer realized that his leg was very was itchy was itched very badly he thought
his owners named him racer
maybe she can help you find the answer to the mystery they found terry r right away first she showed
then there was very a very mysterious box he was carrying on this on this side on a big read letters it said nasa also he kept scrub
her
hole was emptying black rubber gloves
gloves fingers held tweezers were lift
when his owners got h
the people in
dog talk means don't pick on me any more fang
fo few
so he didn't want to lick them for six weeks racer would take walks and go to the dog park but he still had to be on a leash one day he took a walk through the dog park and with
and cousins her good
so would
he ran he would limp
in his way
fang bit him on the back leg and ran away racer's owners said go
racer had been on a leash since he
d run fast
can you explain this she asked what d do you think return the moon by tuesday means i don't know mark answered but this photograph looks very familiar i know it was in a book my sister has known that
one astronaut stayed on the command model well the two other astronauts explored the surface and collected moon rocks what is so special about moon rocks asked mark
now christina was sure she was into something strange
the plane
there was a dog in the park near where he lived
for each mission space craft carried three astronauts one once in the moon orbit
don't understand why anyone would want to wear two watches or how someone could return the moon it was time to go aunt grace terry and mark and christy were in the parking lot when christina saw a familiar face
when he woke up from the surgery he didn't even remember where he was but soon his owners came and drove him home
and was run and run so
there next to and that someday
and she could think of a good reason why anyone would
we can visit the her this afternoon maybe she can help you find
when they reached the second floor christy and mark were amazed they were looking at a glass case with two holes in each
parents
u u and aunt grace was waiting for her christina at the gate christina ran and hugged her on the drive home christina told aunt grace about the flight and the mysterious man who sat next to her on the plane
fo
up with fang and knocked him down racer said bark bark bark which in
the vet because
the
eventually racer didn't have to wear the collar but then his legs didn't itch
going to go away
he developed problems with his back legs every time
christi now was going on airplane for first time she was going to houston texas to visit her aunt
and gave them a big kisses
but it was nice to see all his friends
aunt grace said mark christy terry
but studying moon rocks has comparing them to earth rock s scientist l learn
he would always come up to racer and bite his back leg and run away so
impossible to click to lick his legs
i always wear two watches it tells me what time it is in the yoke tokyo and where my f where my family lives and in the other watch tells me what time it is it is where i am
i work for the n a s a carrying moon samples and i from labs around the world i was very upset when i found i'd lost the picture is there anything i can do to thank you for returning it he said
mean uhm mean old fang said bark bark bark bark which meant why do you have to wear that stupid looking collar
when th
oh boy i'm going to lick my leg so hard that i
this time however christi was sure that
bling scribbling things on a note pad christina had try tried without success to see what the man was writing
parents had been so busy
he like most dog most dogs racer loved to run
them a large photograph uh of the first man on the moon nearby the glass case was a footprint pressed into the lunar soul
like one of the photographs and they signed on a wall nearby scientists use this case of gloves to examine rocks
him when his owners got him
told her that her
white
and from that
days later
and his friends were there as usual then his owners re
because
so so he turned to his head around to lick his legs but there was a
he eased himself gently
dr thomas had captured the alligator
dr thomas set
he tried
then they looked at each other
new orleans
see
into the creek's brown water
explained that he was going to catch the alligator and take it to a place far away from where people lived
nature and science center
ok
and tosses it down
he smiled through the
only its head still t showed
i use it
well dr thomas answered
mr degas
took some big
dr thomas laughed
deep in the swamp
and grandparents
could hear the sounds of the frogs and insects that lived near the creek
you might say win
explained about the alligator
my cat
the truck pulled a trailer with a boat
its wet bumpy
when the log splashed and dragged itself up the bank
what do we do asked bryan
invited
lots
warn
to get away the loop closed tightly around its neck
shut
dr thomas would find a place where it would be
said bryan usually dr said dr thomas explained when an alligator wants to eat
and
he asked
in the boat and bring it
its front
of alligator
a creek ran behind their houses
getting cassie
of their creek
it looks like a bumpy old log
truck
don't
as it struggled
he knows about reptiles
mr degas
come see the alligator judy ann cried
because alligators come in different sizes
slipped
i don't want that alligator getting c
turtles or snake and snakes
from his pocket
long before people did
they were crossing the bridge over the creek when suddenly bryan stopped what's up
its neighborhood
the fireman said
ann
then the alligator snaps up meat
at dr thomas
in the sun
i've seen alligators before but never this close bryan said
the handle is square to keep the pole from
so why don't you stand a little father away if you want to watch continued dr thomas as he walked down toward the animal
said judy ann
said bryan
bryan and judy ann were best friends
to warn the alligator
there was
bryan and judy ann looked
otherwise it would be too dangerous to catch by hand
animal turned his dark eyes toward dr thomas and tried to dive
until something comes by
dr thomas pulled on his
now it was time to put the alligator
he tied up his
his feet firmly on the top muddy bottom
they had heard plenty
louisiana
sure enough a big alligator was wrestling on the bank of the creek
see
dr thomas is a scientist
he took a long pole out of his
slowly now
through the curly brown and gray beard
its throat
let's go go get my dad said bryan
i want that alligator
why is one loop bigger than the other asked judy ann
and gently
alligators live h lived here
black rubber
d
now they had t ta a tale of their own to tell
call dr bob thomas
one saturday judy ann and bryan were riding their bicycles
what invaded
bryan and judy ann looked up
declared judy
alligators can run for only a short distance but they can run fast
wow
hide shone
our use this to catch the alligator he said
our neighborhood
let's call the fire department
dr thomas pulled the alligator to the surface and dragged it to shore
the alligator
on each end
far from people
i can easily hold them closed
he quickly pulled a black rubber
it waits quietly in the water
the
to a new home
and back legs
stories from their parents
at night judy ann and bryan
in a truck that had wildlife rescue painted on it
i'm
they both jumped back when
it was black and tan
it
breathless n news
fiercely
send the waves to
the pole had
but once the jaws are
it invited
listened to the children's
i'll bet it's waiting for its lunch right now
next he looped
answered dr thomas
see their big see these bands
dr
the emergency number
asked judy
dr thomas
he was very tall
meal
maybe we can help it get back where it belongs
what do alligators eat asked bryan
then it crawled back into the muddy water
twisting while
it invaded our neighborhood said bryan
dr thomas looked
now that's a good idea answered mr degas
they lived next door to each other in a small town west of
there's something down in the creek
there he was able to sit on the alligator
he said to himself
i would have to use a trap
at the alligator
finally the alligator grew too tired to struggle
high black boots
balloons are h
she looked at the sky let's see what the clouds tell us about the weather ruth laughed how can the clouds
doctor bell lived next door
ruth found doc by her garage
stratus clouds she said no balloon ride today
let's go

she thought about being blown across sky
fair weather is balloon weather said doc
when the weather
it is

thank you very much
but in less
in the sky
high in the sky are thin white and curly
measures the temperature of the air
she'd had a great time
the pumpkin balloon floated over the land
what a good day it had been
there's no rain or wind
ruth
what are clouds made of asked ruth
doc helped her climb into the basket doc's friends
to find doc she opened the back door she saw
then
okay
as
you need the right kind of weather
doc took her big balloon to the park
us anything
ruth knew what
doc showed ruth pictures of the kinds of clouds
it got bigger and bigger
ruth didn't mind
over
i can see why
balloonists
early thursday morning ruth called doc
ok
it covers the sky
and
sure doc
am i just supposed to read into this microphone
we'd better land now said doc
cumulus clouds
so cumulus clouds
soon the pumpkin balloon
it floated above mr hill's flag
she could hardly wait for a clear blue sky or some cumulus cumulus clouds without any wind
and they said yes she could she couldn't wait
there are only a few cumulus clouds in the sky you're right said ruth said doc
or bits of ice doc sky ex explained
hill's
united united
doc would climb into a large basket tied to the balloon
she could see a cloud dragon suddenly a door slammed
in the glass tube rises
hard to fly said doc
tell
doc liked to ride in balloons
they look like balls of cotton
sh she was looking at her big thermometer
on wednesday the sun was shining
at the park ruth watched the big orange balloon fill with air
in the big balloon
ruth smiled ruth smiled
ok where am i
it is a thick low cloud
ruth dressed in a rush
doc said ruth
than an hour the wind began to blow
those are cum
they tell me that the weather might change in about a day
soon the big pumpkin balloon was very
it floated above ruth's school
now ruth would watch the sky every day
the weather is just right
ruth asked her parents if she could go
clouds are made of tiny drops of water
united
she saw mr
to h to heat the air so the balloon would rise
that monday ruth leaned back in the warm grass
as the air warms the red liquid in the
her friends
doc pointed to the fluffy white clouds
the therm the therm the thermometer
cirrus clouds
the balloon looked like a big pumpkin t to ruth
she had a
floated over
oh yes said ruth
don't go up in the wind she thought it wasn't balloon weather after all
there's no rain no or there's no rain
when the weather is right we'll go for a balloon ride
fog is stratus cloud near the ground
it's a c it's a pumpkin balloon she shouted
ran
always helped to fill the balloon with air
replied i like having company would you like to go up again
okay
they tell us that fair weather is here
third kind of cloud to look for is stratus said doc
mean it's nice out and cirrus clouds mean
was back on the ground
it was so nice to be up high
then it'd be time for another ride in the pumpkin balloon
the next morning ruth saw fog the sky was filled with thick low clouds
you're right ruth said doc
i have an idea she said suddenly
flag flapping in the wind
untied the rope slowly the balloon rose
then the balloon would lift doc high toward the clouds
doc is home ruth said jumping to her feet
as the air cools the red liquid in the tube falls
was down by the river and saw him coming he waited quietly until the cow's
you three can do what you want
also
catch you said the third cow
they even walk down to the river together when they are thirsty
the lion may
i hate climbing the hill said the third cow
we will not s
one was eating g grass on the hill the cow saw the lion coming
mean not to go with me
if they had stuck together the lion would

be hungry
i don't like any of those places said the fourth cow come and
those cows are too hard to catch said hungry lion
with only one set of horns he couldn't fight the lion got him too
you may all be sorry

so the four cows went different ways
i don't like the grass there said another
you're not the boss just because you are older
and i will go
cow was very
i am not afraid of the lion said the fourth cow
and that is the way
if i could catch one of them by himself i could not

then he looked around for the other cows
pasture pasture than any of you
ended
but one of the
come with me and
they are never a far apart and when i get near them they turn their tails to one another and point their long sharp horns at me
if you go
the other two cows were far apart so it was easy

went the fairy when the fair was done was over clint came home a took out his special box
sometimes the wind doesn't blow enough pollen
of each corn
an an hour later
the kernels
maybe you should
where the
over the next few weeks the corn grew quickly
pollen into the corn silk
in the barn
good idea
o
i can't really read that word right there
grow something all by myself to enter the fair
he got a great idea
do it
your corn plants need
his father had
is that supposed to say you or your
to dig in
clint saw those words
said dad
there was a beautiful
take
that afternoon clint
clint could think of
sunny spot four plant seeds in
magazines
do i press that before
dad
when
clint
sprinkled the pollen on the corn silk
to see clint so excited
over a
the farmer was
to spread the pollen
plants for
clint

i'm worried
his father his father
for spring
corn
could i
i could enter th
the wind helps corn pollen fall over the plant

i'm going
clint looked at the seed
sweet corn in
the club gave ribbons for the best projects
look for his father he found
soon the green
if it doesn't if it does not rain
they grow on top of the corn
but the best thing
planting
what can i do for you well
it's time to watch for
there was
first you'd better start now
this summer i'll get the

husk
corn
every day clint
to sprinkle the pollen
grow will grow
the fields
clint asked sure

slowly long leaves grew out of
six the corn should be fully grown in eighty five days
as clint worked
i was thinking maybe
helped her
well do your
arrowhead he found in
plot
farm club
finished clint
he thought
they take
but clint was happy
if the wind would blow
into the bag finally
the
strings of corn silk
these ears are the best he said
on the corn silk
what does that word say
onto the silk
he smiled as he slid a new blue
begin to grow
clint ran to his
kernels
think up a way
one afternoon clint found his dad in
clint worked in his rows everyday finally he marked off the last
packet marked
stalks
dad can i talk to you for a minute

better
pollen to grow
i wonder

in four neat rows
and a key
in straight rows
clint took out his special box
said clint
read the directions
of each ear

tassels
thought and thought finally
that
when clint
good corn
seeds i could plant
what i grow as my project for
to grow sweet corn

as
early may
packets
soon the green shoots were growing tall and straight
clint s
a he found him
in
stalk
if it does not rain
clint
the
that words hard right there
clint always
do
chance
you can use the small
said dad
he wondered if
it was long hard work
when the pollen reaches
of corn
s
these
then
checked his plants
corn plants he had found a way
there is one string of corn
on to the silk yourself
dad he said
sweet
clint said
garden ready
to grow ears of corn
dad said
could plant
all by myself
this is this is it dad
blue ribbon you won
seeds the best
one plant sweet
farm club
whatever seeds you choose i'll be glad to help
when it didn't rain clint remembered to water his corn
he just might win
clint went to
dad answered
but the best thing h and
we
in the box
could win a blue ribbon just like his dad did
today is may
s
husks
he picked three ears
corn plants how does
want your corn to be especially
three plant seeds in a sunny
looked at some of his parents farming
a lot of work
dad smiled
first he put a brown paper bag
at the bottom of the basket was a
packet
the s
clint needed a
in the barn
dust called pollen
box was the blue ribbon
i think i can do
in the garden
i could
y your corn plants
a field
he loved
do your
if
by your mother's garden to plant your crop
go get the seed basket
it into it into the cob
good
enough
he had solved a problem just like a real farmer
cob
finally clint took the bag off the
well said dad
al entered them in the fair

julio grinned
when you run
julio said sadly
julio broke the tape beth was a close
you should do it every other day don't know
in a line
there is a pot of gold under the dirt dig for it if you want turn
you greedy boy you don't need a whole handful at once she said
tell them after
to pull his hand out
but they found no pot of gold
the olive trees in the orchard grew more fruit than ever the
he climbed up on the table and put his hand into the jar he grabbed a whole handful
the next
uhm k
and next time don't be so greedy
the sons
advice
had come from the orchard
the treasure is there
bert let go of the nuts and took only two his hand came out easily
yeah
tell them
so do i click exit now
to give them some ideas
they thought maybe their father had gone crazy
he pulled and pulled and became very angry at the jar
the was so good that when it was sold they got they got a whole pot of gold
they dug until they had turned up the soil from one end of the orchard to the other
do does that say olive
was on a table
they did not
they did not know where the hidden place was
but did not like farm work they wanted to make money fast
his mother laughed when she saw the
gold was hidden he would not
to see what was wrong with him
at one end of the orchard and dig until one of them found the money
try taking out a few at a time
turn over every foot of earth then turn it again and again
he would not
ok a farmer who had worked hard all his life was sick he knew that he would die soon he called his three sons to bed to give him
the mouth of the jar was too small for his fist
they thought maybe someone had stolen it
the good work they had done digging brought the fruit
olive
the glass jar half full of nuts was on the
went to work to find the pots of gold
they were good sons but did not
the sons tried to get him to tell them where the
then they knew what the wise what the wise father had meant when he said there is gold in the orchard dig for it
at last he began to scream and cry his mother ran ran to the room
when you get into trouble again stop and think of a way to fix it instead of screaming said his mother
the boy and the nuts
after the farmer was gone
what's that word
the three sons were upset to have worked for nothing
but it was no use his hand was stuck
the sons saw how much money
they dug around the tree roots and between them
then he tried to put his hand
the next olive s season
albert who loved nuts saw it
they decided to begin in
c cause of all the trouble
my sons he said take good care of the orchard do not sell it
tell
what's the matter albert she asked this mean old jar will not let me have this handful of nuts cried albert

s
than

the plane was in a
mountain
i guess
and we
they had to cover their ears from the horrible sound the flies
a great big parade in franksville to celebrate the fact that for once there was no water problem no fly pr problem no flute
things were going good for franksville
into car accidents and everybody looked really silly at dances dancing to the music they couldn't hear
made this flute sound awful
what they couldn't keep john in jail since he was really s since he wasn't really breaking any laws so
then pretty soon tons of flies were landing on everyone before they knew it the town was filled with flies again oh no the chief sanders it's just when
as bad as the flute sounded it was a lot better than a thousand of flies crawling on them
maybe a poorly played flute doesn't sound that bad but it just
john didn't know what to do so just kept on playing his flute the flies were annoying so it would swat them
and big band
when this guy played it i'm serious still it's not as bad as millions of flies i suppose
the neighbors are complaining and the cats and dogs are trying to chew off their ears but i have to play
their problems were started when they ran out of water thankfully someone was digging a hole and found water
they all had such nice teeth so
but
what up with an idea he thought that if he made a new mouthpiece especially shaped for
should i press end
i was born to do it i don't know why but i feel like i have to or else bad things will happen
as back up
dr wong and john were the stars of the parade
the police chief
before roos before i tell you how rooster john
and no one had cavities so there was a problem in the little town of franksville what should they do they couldn't keep john in jail
that was an ok idea but there was an echo in the well that made his flute sound louder windows were breaking and all the cows in town started to make sour milk
like a rooster and played
and then multiply
and accidentally smashed it into pieces he was very upset at first then he said oh well good thing i brought my old
and down main street everyone cheered suddenly a fly landed on a little girl then a fly landed on someone else
f
fleas
didn't work no one could hear
and the clarinet how however for some reason
i
folk
would land all over the people and they couldn't swat them off it was gross suddenly the flies flew away as fast as they could dr wong for the second pronounced
problem
they just couldn't lead a normal life then they decided to lower him down
we can't let you play the flute anymore john
there was nothing the police could do besides everybody loved john since he had become the town dentist everybody's teeth were much whiter and cleaner
a well and let him play down where no one could hear him john thought
from then on john would wake up at sunrise
it's the flute sound the flies hate john's flute playing as much as we do john is the dentist is driving the flies away
with his hand or even his new flute he started shaking the flute to get his flies
just try to imagine someone scratching a chalkboard with a fork
a big band played as they marched up and
but soon after they started to get fly
so they decided that john could play the flute and everybody else would have to wear earplugs well i'm sure you guessed that
his real love was music he played many musical instruments such as the guitar the tuba the piano
john's mouth then perhaps he could play the flute normally
look john i've heard you play the clarinet you're quite good why don't you play that instead said chief sanders oh that's a nice instrument but it's not the flute
they were up on the main float
that's how the flute sounded
chief sanders
got his name you should know a little bit about the town of franksville franksville was a town that seemed to have no problem after the other
and they didn't want to kick him out of town because
the bad flute player was rooster john he wasn't called rooster john yet that came later he was the new town dentist he was an excellent dentist
the local scientist dr wong came
and play to keep the flies away
flute
that times a hundred
then someone landed on some landed on a bunch of people
it was then that the people of franksville realized they would have to take the good with the bad because
flies they got tons and tons of flies then the flies stopped but just then a man moved to town who played the flute so badly that people would run away screaming
anything people were getting in
this way his mouth was shaped
even wrote you a song chief sanders it's called cops and robbers then he played the song the police chief hated the sound so much that he threw john in jail
and guess what it worked dr wong was the town hero the flute sounded normal and it turned out john could play it quite well people in the town decided to have a big
heard the noise they couldn't even swat the flies anymore

jet pack and flew off to the spring time was running out
shadows
sun is in the sky and shadows are shorter but when i hold
matt laughed
let
look matt it's a koala bear
wing is the place where it noon shadows are long said cassie
the second clue is that
what's the next clue
travel she had put postcards for cassie in mother's letters
school he worked after school
then aunt red red
so also
isn't the
cold
it's noon
you certainly can said matt he reached for the lamp on his desk look on the floor cassie
what is what when
what that
low in the winter it must be
aunt red
in january don't they
i
she looked at
always had a riddle about
cassie
uhm what do you see when i hold the lamp like this cassie looked on the floor
could be in the south america
n noon shadows
in january don't
what's new
aunt red wing is i think
the shadow grows longer that's right said matt
and aunt red wing and her riddles
yes i do cassie said shadows are first clue to the riddle
uhm
that this lamp is the sun
since the noon is sun and
said matt
soon
aunt red wing took people on trips all over the world
she looked carefully at the globe
as she walked to the library cassie read the riddle over
said she asked pointing to a line around the middle of the globe that's right said matt
in
she had some ideas but she
sun is in winter the shadows are long
that's right said cassie australia has koala bears
that's right said matt
ever since aunt red wing had
her brother matt was
that's true said matt
than
cassie s
on matt's desk it isn't the
the sun sets soon
said cassie maybe there's another clue said matt
long the sun
look too closely cassie turned
she said
look what i have another postcard from aunt
the noon
and winter in the june
at noon said matt
the lamp at this angle
that means you have another riddle to figure out
let's pretend that
they live in only australia don't they matt nodded
si si science
in the winter where aunt aunt red wing is right again matt
the suns sets
letters uhm aunt
wing must be somewhere south of the equator cassie thought
aunt at the public library cassie liked to visit him there
equator
studied the riddle i wondered how the length of shadows
so that also tells us
in the month of june
that
the light shines from above the shadow is short during the summer
wait we were trying to guess the riddle that we never even looked at the picture
wing
where aunt red wing is cassie was proud of herself
cassie thought
s that's
where she was this postcard read
the globe
know the sun sets much earlier
maybe she's somewhere in africa
are
i see a short shadow
it's some animal i didn't
or australia
i'll ask matt
hi said cassie
the n the noon wait
when i hold the lamp at an angle like
laughed laughed cassie
can you tell seasons by the length of shadows
w we were so busy trying to guess where riddle
said matt
cassie looked at the postcard it had no postmark or stamp because it came in a letter to her mother it was from a aunt
wait no since the noon is sun
but i haven't solved the riddle yet said cassie
cassie thought for a moment
the postcards she sent
aunt red wing
and over again
hi said matt when cassie came to his desk
well said cassie people who live south of the equator have winter starting in june and summer

and long winter sha
flour on the floor
until he came to the gears
up to her nest
he screamed with fear and ran to the as fast as he could go
came through the roof made it cool and
on the floor and
so the three little mice started off
afraid it's
for not listening to her so she did not scold them
hearts
they ate until the last crumb was gone
end worse than last night
the clock struck one the mouse ran down hickory dickory dock
there
at night there are no people around to bug them
we are big enough now said dock and if i knew my way i would go
she felt that people were mean to kill
he found nothing except a hole inside of
i will chew a hole in the back of the flour barrel
the wind that
it was now almost morning mamma mouse decided t
and slept all day
of in the family
so she dried her eyes and went to work chewing through the board
that lived in the house was fast asleep
their courage up and ran about suddenly dickory gave
that their parents that
wait i need to get a tissue
be good children said mamma mouse the next night just getting ready for her journey
let's go down s said dock so they went down the stairs to the hall
and i bet there are plenty more good things around if we look for them
it was a snug home
mamma came back in the morning she brought some nice flour with her for breakfast she told her
to leave the
it if we went out without her
the clock
but she was sad to find the bread covered with a pan
hickory wanted to go to sleep again but little dock was wide awake
louder than even now he looked he looked way up on the top of the clock and saw something bright
fast for it
she knew she could easily chew through that
only when they were safe
would they
and they were ear
i don't know said hickory again then they saw the clock didn't notice the
your mother knew best when she told you not leave the nest
mamma mouse was brave
hickory stuck his head through
he stuck his head into
this better
father
they crept over the thick carpet until they came to some stairs
there lived a family of mice
i knew
a shiny wheel to see what
even cats sleep some mice run
she kissed each one
mice can't earn money like people do so they have to live by stealing food
in their nest again did
named hickory
there in a corner lay almost half of
some night said dock it's dock it's no fun to stay here
he went
it took time to do this because she could only work at night
after tonight
when mama mouse came down to look for him he was dead
dock went to the clock
they were surprised by what they saw
and as dark as any mouse could ever want
what is it
she thought
but you must promise to be careful and not get into trouble
the next time you run away
through the crack and his two brothers came after
had always her
the bad dock
she took a few crumbs that were on the floor for her children and ran
if you could only get to it without saying anything to his brothers dock ran up
but just then she saw a barrel
beat
that made her happy
he was just bright
hickory dickory and dock were very glad to get the crumbs because they were hungry
when he got to the hall he heard his brother's running up the stairs he ran after them as fast as he could
ticked out the minutes loud and strong voice
summer wait
with hickory showing the way soon they came to a crack in the wall
it s is it alive asked dock
she only said you see my dears
while he was hunting for food one night he saw a nice piece of cheese in a box and tried to get it when
inside the hollow wall of the house way up near the roof
beat very fast because they knew if they were found they have to run for their lives
and they were fat and happy
after all remember what happened to your fath
there had once been a papa mouse as well but he died
and
to bite
out into the world and see what it looks like
a poor mouse because he wanted to get food for himself and his family
the clock
where it will not be found
there were three children
so
between the kitchen and the wall
i wish i could go with mother
a yell that made his brothers come running
more than their parents this adventure
when mama mouse came down
to the kitchen don't come out of our nest till i come back
it was it was nice and quiet
of the house very carefully
but they couldn't find more all the doors in the hall were closed
oh yes said hickory well said hickory i'd like to take a stroll myself
they told her about their adventure
should teach you always to listen to your mother
attack on the floor flour barrel on the next for the next night
she doesn't have to know said
the clock was just telling the time but the bell just beside docks ear
how mean wait how mean people are to put things where a hungry mouse cannot get to them said mamma mouse with a sigh
he jumped around in the nest so much that his brothers could not sleep
he thought it must be good to even he
that their little hearts
and they could eat the flour instead of bread
had eaten they all curled up with their mother
to the chimney to keep
but kept ticking away so they got
children sometimes think that
was a brave mouse and he knew that it was her job to find food for her children
he saw that all was quiet the family of people
box it closed with a snap
wait
this is better than the kitchen said dock they had finished their supper and i bet
but hickory and dickory and dock did not run away again
what shall we do now said hickory asked his brothers
i know a way out said hickory but mamma wouldn't like it if
it was one o'clock the clock
about in the day but they are not very smart
good bye and ran down the wall when they were left alone
dock could hear the ticking
at last mamma mouse chewed through a hole in the board big enough for her to get through into the kitchen
they stop to breath they were so scared that their little heartbeat
and dickory and dock
the little girl of the family had
all the time she will take us when we are big enough said dickory
mice like to sleep during the day and work at night
will not be hungry for a long time
mama mouse was sad to be all alone
mamma mouse liked it
there was a big wall for hats
and coats a bucket for umbrellas two very pretty chairs and best of all a tall clock that stood
said dickory very quietly i don't know said hickory he was afraid t
they had been punished enough already
i'll take you through the hole that i found
hickory dickory dock the mouse ran up the clock
it was a great find for the three mice
it may
their little heart beat
the little mouse
and ran back into the wall
side to the clock
of
fast for an hour

finally the day of the big race came everyone in school was at the track
he used his watch to time himself

they both agreed
a fact we can put on our article

louis said we're still not sure how we can find facts about eyesight here
and whether is something
he looked at louis
article about eyesight
did you sam
and you learned a lot
sam said reading the sign below the window
we can
a another cage look sam it's a big fat snake
pil
one of our our senses sh that shouldn't be too hard

wait i saw something moving out of the corner of my eye right here near that big a rock
sam and sh
d i saw that sam
ms gordon smiled
at our sides right continued louis per

every day clint checked
then the farmer has to help
they
by your mother's garden to plant your crop that afternoon clint planted the corn seeds in four neat rows
there was a beautiful golden shell and key chain from the zoo
almost taste the wonderful corn
the family garden ready for spring planting
i wondered what
once a week
he had solved the problem just like a real farmer over the next few weeks the corn grew quickly clint worked
father's now there were two blue ribbons in the family
shut at
his dad in the fields dad he said
clint took
long leaves grew out of
fall over the plant
ears are the best he said
on top of the cornstalk
as clint worked in the garden he got a great idea why don't i try to grow something all by myself
i think i can do it dad said clint good siad dad
what there was the
i'll be glad to help
i could enter what i grow as my project for the farm club
this
good corn takes a lot of work clint read the direction
i really want to win one said clint
three ears of corn these
i'm worried that not enough pollen will fall on the corn silk
corn silk
there is one string of corn
pollen for the corn silk
maybe you should think up a way to sprinkle the pollen
in to a the
when it didn't rain clint remembered to water his corn soon the green shoots were
blue ribbon sweet corn
his father had won at
the wind helps
and plant seeds the best part
finished clint
first
does not rain
so
the blue ribbon season
well
finally he marked off the last of the eighty five days
clint looked at his corn plant how does pollen help
by july plants were as tall as clint
it was long hard work but
called
them in the fair
bag shut
you can use the small plot
your mother
was a packet marked sweet corn
he found
plant sweet corn in early may
if clint could think of a project his farm club just might win
the f
plant seeds in straight rows
pollen
these strings
an hour later clint ran to his corn plant he found a way to spread the pollen
when the pollen reaches the cob
his plants for tassels he wondered if the wind would blow enough
you want your corn to be especially good
take it
this is it dad i'm going to grow sweet corn
spring turned into summer the days past quickly
of corn
clint always helped her he loved to dig in the dirt
of it
kinds of seeds i could plant
clint went to look for his father he found him working in the barn dad can i talk to you for a minute clint asked sure clint said his father what can i do for you
in his rows every day
the bottom carefully he bent
clint thought and thought finally he looked at some of his parents farming
soon the silk and husks of each plant were covered with pollen
the stock
i'll enter the
next he held the
today is may f first so you better start now
clint looked at the seed packets at the bottom of the basket
arrow arrowhead
on the directions on the seed packet
this summer i'll get the change he thought
plant the seeds in a sunny spot
i was thinking maybe i could grow something all by myself enter
well said dad sometimes the wind doesn't blow enough
out of each corn husk
magazines
skill for each kernel
one afternoon clint found
on the silk yourself
cob
the
dad smiled
growing tall and straight slowly
then he shook the plant the pollen
corn pollen
was watching the seeds sprout
top
the corn should be fully grown in eighty five days
he pulled
clint took his special box he kept his favorite things in that box
get the seed basket take a look at what's in there said dad whatever seeds you choose
county fair when he was a boy clint wished he could win a blue ribbon just like his dad did
to see clint so excited you'd better read the directions dad said growing
do you remember the blue ribbon ribbon you won at the fair
that morning he picked
the plant strings of
the pollen would not spill out of the bag
where the kernels will grow
one day dad and clint stood out by corn plant
clint was happy
pol
when the fair was over clint came home and took out his special box he smiled and he laid a new blue ribbon next to his
and
in a field
when clint saw those words he could
garden
get the ground ready for planting
it's time to watch for
water the seeds
to enter the fair
onto the silk
catch the pollen said dad
the kernels begin to grow

at the bottom carefully he bent
every day clint checked
five water seeds once
of the stalks but julie planted
seeds in neat in four neat rows in neat rows
a bot
porch
clint needed a good idea
this is it dad
why does the bottle make that sound
she smiled
the room
pollen was being sprinkled onto the
ramon knew what it was
they had moved to the
what does vibrate mean asked
when the wind stops
what i grow
plant sweet corn in early may
their mother
pull the rubber band rita he
there are lots of sounds
when he was a boy
tipped it down i mean closed it at the bottom
he picked up a bottle and blew
ramon watched rita pulled the rubber band
to vibrate
done
you there were lots of things to hear round
ramon said
want your corn to be especially good
the kitchen floor
the morning three ears of corn
then they heard something strange
and because it's so
when clint saw those words he almost
so that's what been making those add n odd noises
if clint
and forth very quickly mom answered
stalks came up and then he
clint asked sure clint his fat
like it
they take it into the cob where the kernels will grow
a bottle mom explained
he entered the
maybe it's the wind said
you'd better read the di directions he said
the wind blew again i'm done
that the house is
as clint worked in the garden
finished clint
and this is the how he did it he took
rita began
the porch
arrowhead he found in a field
and
blow enough pollen
good
laugh
dad and clint stood out by the corn plant
everyone looked around
how does
soon
rita decided to
ears if the corn
they heard a groan again
there
right
talking
he loved to dig in the dirt and plant seeds the best part was watching the seeds sprout
she blew across the top
vibrates
ramon said
the air into
the bottle moves back
ramon still missed the city
followed
is for
ramon
ok i'm done
did you see the rubber
room inside
that's how
there must be a
asked rita
let's try them said dad
there is more
in
the road
then the farmer has to help you
several boxes sat
looked at the seed packets
the air
in the contest and he won the contest
dad
uh
ramon was sitting
the noise
pollen said dad
like his dad did
suddenly the house
to his father's
groaning
an hour later clint ran to his head corn plants he found a way to spread the pollen
and rita are right laughed mom
dad smiled to clint
the winds
and then he thought up
all by myself to enter at
bottles
clint took out his special box he kept his favorite things in that box
his plants for tassels he wondered if
the pollen would not spill out of the bag
if it does if it does not rain
really
were as tall as clint
ramon
clint
they grow on top of the corn
them away
movements are
she felt
clint always helped her
empty
brother
i can show
just two weeks ago
mom smiled
ramon and rita picked up the bottles
the top of it
could win a blue ribbon just like his dad did
the same kinds of
and then
let it go
in a sunny spot
plot by your mother's garden to plant your crop
here joked rita
i'll enter
i don't know
dashes out of
up a way to sprinkle the pollen onto your silk yourself
farm club he just might win
taste the wonderful corn
a voice behind them
well do you remember that blue ribbon
and then one day he said to his dad that
the wind blew
movements are called vibrations
rita finished try try staring onto a kite
b
the sound stops
ramon and rita sat on the back porch of
air inside the bottle
i
work
round
and a key chain from the zoo
and he
look at
flowed
held a rubber band in his hand
on the corn silk e
silk of each ear soon silk husks of each plant were c covered with pollen
dad he said i'm worried that not enough pollen
you can use the small
chimney
awful noise coming from asked mom
clint went to his
hang
ok
dad closed the door
clint thought
greens shot
i think

it's coming
corn pol pollen fall over the plant
when pollen reaches the cob the kernel
ramon
many sizes
the bottle sounds like
quiet here
our ears

then a new sound filled
to vibrate
ramon an listened listened
vibrate
it has less
it and made the air around it move very fast
thunder said mom
and
will they all make different sounds
the sounds right
that's right said dad
to look
and he took the bag and sprinkled the pollen on to the corn silk and then he entered his three best husks
when the wind blows over it
well said dad sometimes the wind doesn't blow enough pollen onto the silk
cowbells ringing from the farm down
over next f over the next few weeks the corn grew quickly clint worked
ca catch the
it's the house that's making

new york rita whispered
and everyday he watered them finally the stalks came up and
ramon

advice from
our our study shows that
maria was

mo
by the end the week
r
when

she
a long time ago there
so she looked up at him and said
weren't any red
playing
and the little white
turned
he started
all the roses in the world were
looking at me so hard
or any pink ones there were only white roses
because you are so pretty
rosebud woke up
on pink
ter
w
and yellow ones
uhm all he wanted
early one morning a little
racer
pushed
rosebud
white
when
the little white
with
r
owners got him as a
white
where
to
wh
ones
puppy
ve very
which one this one
rose rose
racer
after that all her cousins and were little pink roses
so had that
were
should i
of
said the big round sun
turned
she saw the sun looking at her
she t
pick roses
why are you
ones
to do was run and run so his owner
w
blushed
once
didn't know what to do
there
has
named him
there's as was one dog at the park named fang
he went with his owners to the dog put
racer realized his legs itched very badly
costumes gave him treats but racer didn't
racer didn't have to wear
have
he like most dogs racer loved to run
just then fang bit him on the back leg and ran away
to be on a leash
finally
when his owners got him as a puppy
up to fang and knocked him down
there were
from his surgery but it was nice to see all his friends
as usual
how was where
go to the dog park
does
said go run
so happy that he could run fast
racer was running
on the day home
racer always chased fang but he could never catch him
he he developed problems with his back legs every time he ran
he was wearing
he enjoyed playing at the dog park because he didn't have to
racers had
through the dog park as his friends were
to have surgery to fix his legs
thing in his way
so he didn't want to lick them for six we weeks
looking collar
oh another typo
pick on me any more fang
knew racer could never catch him but suddenly he noticed that racer was catching up
just then fang bit bit him on the back leg and ran away
meant you are too slow to catch me
when
dog talk means don't
there was a dog in
out around his neck
but he still
eventually
he
remember and before
racer liked t the vet
on a big
which meant
but that didn't stop him from running because
collar that made it impossible to lick his legs
there
he would always
a walk
dog park
the collar but by then his legs didn't itch
he thought oh boy i'm going to lick my leg so hard that the itching is going to go away so he turned his head around to lick his legs but there was a big white
s but racer didn't racer didn't know it but he was at the vet to
have to wear that stupid
fang was laughing because he knew
ran away racer's owners
one day he took
come up to racer and bite his back legs and run away saying bark bark bark bark which which in dog talk
all he wanted to do was run run so his owners named him racer
he ran back to his owners and gave them big kisses for fixing his legs
racer said bark bark and which in
a dog
then his owners reached out around
mean old fang said bark bark bark bark which meant
and
so racer started running and chasing fang
sure does look silly
that
faster than he ever
it
one day racer went to the vet
and would limp
why
a
be on his leash when he was there
there
had to be on a leash since he still need to heal
racer would take walks and
how
so racer's owners
sure
and from that day on fang never bit racer's legs and racer was
racer was catching up to him
with that limp of yours so i'm going to pick on you
when he woke up from his surgery he didn't even remember where he was but soon his owners came and drove him home
when he got older
in a park near where he lived
and took off his leash
had
owners
ran and ran in circles
he knew it he caught
liked the vet because people in white
on the drive home
h like
why do you have
a few days later he went to the owners
so he could run as much as he liked
around his neck he had run
past
she said you're on julio grinned
told him to he always stretched his muscles before he ran
do that four times explained coach benson and don't forget to warm up before you run a
exe
julio was mad
happy at no
ok said julio
shouted derek
beat when he beat drake in the big race at first julio found
you
track track
t time
him but he made himself do it
race to race for a minute then race back
at
he could run the
but after a while derek was far ahead of julio derek turned and shouted
sure i do i want to be on the track
misses
rest
hey julio did you
now julio understood why the coach had told him to practice
benson if you want to be a
every day he wrote
his big sister elena asked there's going to be a big race derek is going to beat me he beats me at everything julio said said sadly
ran his heart beat steadily
he slammed the door behind him what's wrong
sprinting you should do
muscles aren't used to running if you you run a little every day your muscles will get stronger
julio didn't say anything he was too busy warming at last
never heard what w word that word before i don't think so coach he said pick up pick a spot that is not too far away race to it as fast as you can race for a minute then
your sister can show you how
beaten drake julio turned to beth
every other
ok so right
he powered on the speed
that is the third important thing to do
muscles that you haven't been stretching can get hurt
now
hardly catch his breath
you also want to run fast
he was out of breath he could feel his heart pounding in his chest but as the f
first
aren't used to running
derek turned to julio and said i'm sor
pr
do that for ten t
what does warming up mean he asked warming up means
derek and another runner came named beth
you might
mmm he
that are ex that are ex exercising
some day said beth so i so do i said julio
i'm going to race in it and i'm going to win julio laughed and
then he would run back to where he started then he'd do it over again each time he practiced sprinting he thought of what
are three things you should do she said first you should run for fifteen minutes every day how will that help asked julio when you run you use a lot of muscles in your body accept
beth was
for the race how do i do that julio asked
wrote down in his notebook how much he had run
a close second julio became
as they raced around the track julio sped
julio thought for a moment he and
he had run his very best that day and he had
drake now beth was the only runner ahead of julio he poured
is the
exercises his elena said you stretch your muscles muscles
what else can i do in the race you not only want to be able to run and not get tired
he could
at how well he was doing
your muscles aren't used to
the two boys ran as fast as they could at
found it hard to run he always
practice tomorrow you can talk to my coach i'm sure she can help you said elena
l lined up to start
anyway he
to where you started that's what sprinting means do you
elena what
out on your mark as get set go the race was on as quickly as they could drake and they could
team
he wa
told you told you i'm going to win the race
better runner there
sprinting as the two runners crossed the finish line julio broke the tape
by counting to sixty
hear there's going to be a big race in four weeks said dr drake great to his friend i'm going to the race in it
do you know what sprinting means
w
even sign up and had an idea why don't you train
he was tired and out of breath as
it even other day
the big moment came the principal of the school called
is always good to str stretch before running ok big sister show me what to do said julio for the next four weeks julio went to the park every day training for the race was training for the race was not easy sometimes he didn't feel like running
race r
julio looked
i bet you practice don't you
er he got the more
he's not so great thought julio
but so did beth
the next day julio went to see coach
day julio worked on his speed he w would choose a tree not too far away and race to it he would
like
it always
said coach benson so the second thing you should do is some
when he ran to
his body felt tired when he got home
wait
as the days passed he ran longer and farther without getting tired his muscles got stronger the strong
could at first they were running at the same speed
i'm surprised that you're even here i'm the one who will win this race y
practiced just like the coach and his sister
four
doing stretching exe
took the lead suddenly drake started to slow down
can work longer without getting tired
do you think we could practice running together
you might as well not even sign up julio
used his watch to time himself and he knew he was getting faster he was
explained coach benson
a laughed at derek and said oh really prove it i'll race you it at to my house and we'll see who wins ready set go
he it would be like when he
come to
finally the day of the big race came everyone in school was at the track the the runners
beamed as the principal placed a medal
sped
ok meet me tomorrow afternoon
the suddenly st strong breeze
and they
helped raise the sail on the mast
in the evening the opposite happens because the land cools off more quickly than the ocean does
right now the wind is coming from the ocean
on the western horizon the es the rosy glow of clouds stretched across the sky
the land and the sea are just
the ears
she had promised to take him sailing on her boat
aunt
in the daytime the ocean is cooler
newt and aunt
a pole rising from the center of the boat the sail reminded newt of a hang
newt ran n to the window he ope he couldn't see the lights in town he couldn't see the moon
aunt helen pointed up see it
soon sunlight will warm up the air
aunt helen replied why don't we
entered a cove newt steered a boat
no she said why not asked newt
said newt
a rowboat drifted from the rope tied to the dock they climbed in and aunt helen rowed
the cool air pushes the warmer ocean out of the way so now the wind is coming from the land newt and said i want to learn how to sail can we go again tomorrow aunt ellen smiled
no wind at all what happened to the wind he ask it is just the afternoon
the sail caught the breeze cast off mooring line aunt ellen said newt untied the rope that held the boat he could feel the boat begin to move
to a hazy world he watched water drip from the porch roof as he ate blueberry muffins the fog was beginning to clear
the mainland is beginning to cool it cools faster than the ocean
after newt and aunt helen ate they explored the island they returned to the beach
newt decided that tomorrow would be a fine day for sailing
how do you know newt asked one way is to look
so there's no wind
in the air
ocean air out of the way we get a breeze from the land to the ocean two hours later the
did you ever want a motor boat newt asked
do you know that
their picnic lunch and
late in the afternoon newt noticed that the air was still
from the next room aunt ellen spoke it's only the fog horn next we're fogged in he crawled back to bed and soon dreamed again
but the sail was tied
newt had arrived yesterday
then we can go sailing
a long low sound awakened
telltale this i this is the morning breeze blowing
as they raised the sail
into vapor again
t toward a sandy beach then aunt helen dropped the anchor
in from the beach
there's no wind but i know that soon the wind will the blow again
ocean air pushes the warm land air out of the way
the front of the boat moved to the right then when newt moved the tiller toward the right the boat turned left
what will that tell us asked
r rolled to the sailboat
doldrums aunt el
aunt ellen laughed
is the tiller you use it to steer the boat
is that magic or what know what asked it's changing temperatures that we talked about
waded ashore
and turned the white sail pink
how do you know
when the cooler air
about the same temperatures
this fog won't last long she said the temperature drops dropped last night the water vapor
ellen owned a small sailboat it had tin it had a tiny cabin
pushes the warm
ellen put on life jackets they carried
than the land so the air above the water is cooler than the air above the land
the night air felt cold and damp
hanging on a clothesline
neat newt said newt arrived yesterday
it's called a
collect some shells while we wait at six thirty the wind picked up aunt helen decided to get back on the boat
that will turn the fog on
if the wind stops then you can't go anywhere motors are noisy replied aunt helen i like the peace and quiet of sailing sometimes
the boat
she pushed the tiller and left the side of the boat
will tomorrow be a good day for sailing let's ask the sunset
will
right when the cool
the fog horn honked again why do they need a horn to tell us it's foggy he asked we can see the fog
i'm going to teach you to steer aunt helen said this
do
on the wind
at that flag on the town dock aunt helen explained what if you're far from land and you can't see a flag wind asked i tie a piece of red yarn to the top of the mast
but
constructed no water droplets that make up the fog
how will we get home again newt asked don't worry there's going to be a good wind after six o'clock
aunt ellen smiled
boat neared the island and
oars down the sandy path to the dock
what cool air does to warm air asked aunt ella it pushes it out of the way
at its corners instead of letting the breeze slip under it the way the sheet did
newt awoke
there
to spend a week of his summer vacation with aunt ellen
s to warn sailors about rocks and land it's like a lighthouse for
the day exploring
by ten thirty the fog horn had
newt from his dreams honk honk the sound stopped all newt could hear was the waves slapping on the beach then the lonely sound returned honk honk
newt watched it snap in
newt
in the evening the wind blows out from land why doesn't the wind always go the same way
and they waded
as they planned to sail to an island and spend
aunt ellen moved the sail to catch more wind you sail by knowing the direction of the wind she said
he asked she said red sky in the morning sailors take warnings red sky at night sailors' delight the red sun settled down
the breeze blows from the ocean to the land
the foghorn doesn't sound to tell us it's foggy it sound
aunt ellen
oh willow tree said the little bird
from the wind with jumper juniper berries to eat
i do not know said the bird the trees will not let me live with them and my wing is broken and i cannot fly you may live in on one of my branches said the spruce
so the little bird fluttered up into the warm branches of the spruce the pine tree kept the wind off his house
that night the north wind came to the woods to play he blew the leaves with his icy breath
and fluttering with his broken wing first he came to was a silver
the trees at the edge of the forest talked to each other i wouldn't take care of a strange bird said the birch i wouldn't risk my acorns said the oak i wouldn't talk to strangers said the willow and three tree stood up very tall and proud
what a thing to ask
i will li
he did not know what to do he looked all round to see if there was any place where he could keep warm
what the pine
he loved to see the bare trees may i touch every leaf he said to his father the forest king

so he went to the forest hopping
the poor little bird did not know where to go but he hopped and fluttered along with his broken wing the spruce tree saw him and said where are you going little bird
the little bird was very happy in his warm nest f
so north wind had to leave them alone the spruce and pine and the juniper tree kept their leaves all through the winter and they have done so ever nice
so the little bird hopped and fluttered with his broken wing til he came to a willow tree by the edge of the brook

will you let me live in your warm branches until springtime comes oh my said the birch
with his broken wing until he came to the next tree
by the edge of the brook oh willow tree said the little bird
he could he did did not know what to do
he wanted to touch every leaf in the forest
by
for the winter from her branches
what a thing to ask
yes said the spruce tree
fluttered in the warm branch of the spruce
let me live in your warm branches until the springtime comes what a thing to ask said the oak tree if you stay in my branches all winter
the pine tree stood beside the spruce when he saw little bird hopping and fluttering oh his broken wing
a would not talk i would not talk to strangers said the willow and the three trees stood up very tall and proud
so he went to the forest hopping and fluttering with his broken wing
the spruce the pine and the juniper tree kept their leaves all all leaves all the winter
the poor little bird did not know where to go
a long long time ago
said the spruce here is the warmest one of all
oh big oak tree said the little bird
he saw the trees of the big forest
the little bird was happy
he said to his father the frost no said the frost king the trees which were kind to the bird with the broken wing may keep their leaves
the little bird hopped and fluttered his broken wing until he came to the willow tree
then the juniper tree saw what the pine and the spruce were doing
he blew at the leaves with his icy breath and every leaf touch
but i can keep the wind off because i am big and strong
ever since
was a silver birch
they ever ha and had they ever done and they have done so
the spruce tree saw him he said where
winter was coming and the birds flew away to the warm south
he may live on one of my branches
it was a great big oak tree
will you let me live in your warm branches until the springtime comes no said the willow tree i will never talk to s i never talk to strangers go away
juniper branch berries are very good for the little birds
he loved the trees bare may i touch every leaf he said to the father
he looked all round to see if there was any place where he could keep warm
i have to take care of my own leaves through winter go away
i will like to have you
you will be eating my acorns go away
the pine tree kept the wind off his house
that night the north wind came to the woods to play
with his broken wing my branches are not very warm
and they
the first tree came he came to
it it was very cold
but he hopped and fluttered along with his broken wing
but may i stay all winter
the little bird
will you le
the pine tree beside the spruce
the tree at the edge of the forest the trees at the edge of the forest talked to each other i wouldn't take care of a strange bird said the birch a wouldn't risk my acorns said the oak
so north wind had to leave them alone
in his warm nest away from the wind with juniper berries to eat
maybe the trees will keep me warm through the winter he said
it he touched fell to the ground
by the e
she said that she would give the little bird his dinner
the one little bird had a broken wing and could could not fly
the little bird hopped and fluttered
beautiful birch tree he said
there they would wait for the spring
where are you going little bird i do not know said the little bird the trees will not let me live with them
clear the cliff sides it must be deeper there she thought
laurie asked listen whispered uncle don above the splashing laurie could hear a faint r roar
raft reached the canyon floor floor i tried happy group the paddles
rapids said uncle don the water is too
under the stairs in the morning the river looked even lower eat up laughed uncle john the more you eat the lighter the raft will be when
answered with a smile she's got to
that's how we'll buy the fruit
asleep that night next morning everyone got on the rafts laurie you a ride with your
the next day everyone at at the quickly they inflate the rafts and put them in the water
decided to stop and camp why are we shopping now
let's find out by estimating said uncle don he pushed a an oar into the water until it hit the bottom then he pulled out
this is
the left
his little aunt don said we must careful measure the height of everything we bring we don't want to
i'll also have to s repack the rafts very carefully laurie listened to the roar she wondered how a rock slide
he said the f the filled cooler can't weight more than twenty seven pounds our cooler weighs thirty pounds we can fill three two liter of plastic puddles of water and freeze them each one will weigh four pounds that means we can bring three pounds of fruit and laurie ac accidently said mom now let's estimate the weight of some fruit and make
the mountain of rocks
we going to ride any big
rapids uncle don told everyone how to travel through the rapids stay close
load if you want
laurel's favorite uncle the year he promised to take them on one of the river trips in
pulled through the water rafts bounced off the canyon walls water poured sh in what wh
to myself
we'll need a
middle of a spending raft all around her water a
at rock slide at
side
your right again
uncle don climbed the rocks over looking rock slide everyone followed laurie as down into the canyon there the lazy rio
some fresh fruit from uncle don
we get to rock slide laurie wondered the rock slide could be as they paddled small rafts rapids riddled in the distance why do rapids look different than the rest of the river ask laurie look at the water uncle don explained what
we'll put our rafts in the water she said she moved her hand down the
roared
it's a prize of
it's going to be a rough trip through rock slide what's a rock slide laurie laurie was puzzled
big bend national park
measure everything
took a long time for
branches of grapes at the store laurie and her mom carefully weighted the fruit on the list
no
laurie looked at the water
the rafts turned and and tossed
that's rock slide uncle don said mysteriously
soon laurie hugged in the
in the water uncle don is making his raft lighter she thought i bet it's shallow
rested on and nearby tired beach inside in
is fast too laurie added you
she had no sinking through rock slide
pack for clothes and pick up
get
this is where
mother today said uncle don laurie looked at the rafts the food chests of water jugs were almost empty the rafts seemed much higher
laurie watched uncle don
rock slide what is rock slide asked
it out com compare the wet part of the oak with the ice chest the ice chest is about eighty centimeters long wow the wet part is about twice as long as long that's only one and a half meters uncle don looked worried the river is low
left and read the words
we don't want the drafts to be too heavy he wants to fill our big cooler with fruit and ice we'll
could make such a sound it
a shopping list on the way to the store laurie wrote the list fourteen apples fourteen oranges twenty bananas two melons two pineapples and two
rides it's asked laurie
in the sides of the cliffs he said laurel looked
to master the rio grande as at rock slide
when laurie's boat leaned against the rocks she gasped as
pull out rows through the water when she looked into the river how deep is the rio grande she asked
grande river then she stopped and
laurie spread the texas map out on the dining room table she looked at the green patch on
need plenty of daylight when we reach it
santa el canyon then had served rock slide but laurie had learned something too she learned as that a safe trip
as they turned the next bend of the river laurie saw another rafts sinking on the bank the river had disappeared into
are
grande turned into fast
has nothing to do with luck you must carefully plan and measure your load of
is different about the water in the rapids
uncle don was
as he crashed over rocks paddles
what is the jugs asked laurie uncle don answered in summer people need lots of water each day laurie was surprised uncle don had measured everything carefully before the trip she was glad that they had been so careful with the fruit
don uncle don smiled just wait you'll find out soon that night the camp they camped on the river bank
the trip mom
her mother looked over her shoulder she pointed to a place called
in sounds because
her to fall
it weighed thirty four pounds that is the pretty good estimate mom said yes but i'd better take off some fruit
until rock slide uncle don smiled early in the afternoon uncle don is
it's was darker
as last the
laurie started at the riddles it's shallow she said i can see little rocks on the bottom right now watch that leaf float through the
duckbill

two days later scott carried the fossil to the museum
of your
pot of gold they thought maybe someone had stolen it they thought maybe their father had gone crazy the three sons were
the other
the gold in the orchard a farmer wh
together when they are t thirsty if i could catch one of them by himself
the sons tried to get him
they got a whole pot of gold
uhm dirt
and i will stay right here you may all be sorry if you go the lion may catch you said the third cow i am not afraid of the lion said the fourth cow if none of you will go with me i'll go by myself t i if myself to eat
i like grass right there i don't like any of those places said the fourth cow come with me and i will find the
of the
give them some advice they were good sons but did not like farm work they wanted to make money fast my sons he said take good care of
cow
oh if i could catch one of them by myself i would not be hungry
went to work to find the the pot of gold they did not they did not know where the hiding place was they decided to begin in a line
turn over turn over every foot of earth then turn it again and again the treasure is there
well why not w well w i mean why do no why will not do it well we will not do it said the said the other three cows you're not the boss just because you're older
him coming he waited quietly until the cow was very near and jumped then they then he looked around for the other cows one was eating grass on the hill
those cows are too hard to catch said a hungry lion there are they are v n never far apart and when i get near them they turn their tails
upset to have worked on nothing for nothing
two cows were were far apart so it was easy for the lion to jump to to jump them also and that is the way the cow's fight ended if they had stuck together the lion would still be hungry
if a farmer who had worked hard all his life was sick he knew that he would die soon he called his three sons to his bed to
i am going to the valley said the first cow you three can do what you want and i will go to the hill said the second
if i could catch one of them by himself
to tried to get him to tell them where the gold was hidden he would not tell them after the farmer was gone the sons
the sons saw how much money had from had come from the orchard then they knew what the wise father had meant when he said there's a there is gold hidden in the orchard dig for it
no there is a pot of gold under the dirt do dig dig for it if you want
i will find you the best grass you ever had
to eat at a better pa pasture that than any any of you can find i am older than you and i know where the best grass grows you had better follow me
so the four cows went different ways one went to the valley the lion was down by the river and saw
uhm orchard and to dig until one of them found the money
gr grew more fruit than ever the gold the good work they had done digging brought the fruit it was so good that when it was sold
the orchard do not sell it there is a part pot of
i think you are mean not to go with me
but one day the cows had a fight the best grass is over in the valley said one said one cow let's go there i don't like th the i don't like the grass there said another it is better on the hill i want to spend the day there i hate climbing the hill said the third cow
one of the or
they dug until they had turned up the soil from one end of the orchard to the other they dug around the th the the tree roots and between them but they found no
the cow saw the lion coming and was scared he couldn't get away and with only two set set of horns it was only one set of horns he couldn't fight the the lion got him too
to one another and p point their long sharp horns at me then they they they ever they even walk down to the river

what is so special about moon rocks
they found terry right away
now christi was sure she was
and each hole was an empty black rubber glove
sh tennis shoe
clearing up the moon
i'm stuck on this word
when they reached the second floor
present
the man

they then there was the very mysterious box he was carrying
two questions for me
one watch that tells me
terry is

the f
soil
they were looking at glass cases with two holes

the plan
familiar i know what

after lunch the man pushed his seat back and took a nap christi took
she said

a sign hung
apple
and she
into the lunar
also
showed two shiny gloves poking
in one of her books
while
first
for one thing there
mark answered
up
explored
story told her story
so much for your mystery said mark
to earth's rocks
you know that
one astronaut
could return the moon
a piece of moon rock
and carrying an umbrella
ex
where i am
the man turned around and christi
i'm stuck on this one right success to see what the man was
this time
rubber glove
in looked like the print
f
i can do to thank you
comparing them
nearby in a glass
the plane landed and when the mysterious man left
sure it wasn't

all together
through two round holes
christi and mark

parts of it were
in a
in each hole

and changed over billions of years
and she couldn't think of a good reason why anyone would
you know that terry is trying to be

that's puddles
ma news amusement park
time to do your homework
change your gears mike yelled jeff jeff wash
that's the name of the roller coaster lisa pointed toward a big steel hills wow it's huge said mike
answered lisa just then puddles jumped from jeff's arms jeff caught the puppy and climbed on his head he highs i guess puddles thinks it's time to go home laughed jeff
but jeff wasn't about to let him escape again
pedaling pad at off paid off
i don't know
a
with one quick push of the pedal the chain wrapped around the gear there he said
rememb
that's just another name for a ramp
on a roller coaster the cars are the attached
several simple mentions
need some big gears to climb them and strong legs too added mike jeff looked down the fun station
pulls things
had an idea our bikes go up hill are they machines
fence jeff dropped to his knees and peered through the hole
below
when the cars reach the top the force gravity pulls them down the hill
puddles puddles mike and jeff shouted but puddles did not return
c
it's it's like a brand new bike jeff grinned
puddles up up ahead
the hand
in a few minutes puddles was in jeff's
at the top of the hill the boys stopped that catch their breath
how you like the roller coaster ride as the boys turned toward home mike thought about his homework i know what i'm going to do for science fair
the roller coaster is made of si
look at those hills mike i'll bet
cried jeff
as mike's chain slipped over a larger gear
i can see why they call it it great but what about gravity
that's much easier if the roller coaster to climb a ramp than to go straight up explained lisa
on the roller coaster jeff and mike squeezed their hand brakes to slow down
my name's lisa
i'm just glad that we won't need to pedal so hard going down the hill
turns the gears the chain pulls the cars up the first hill
oh
the boys jumped on their bikes and
mike rode the bicycle down the driveway and circled back toward jeff
the the
can you make him come back through this hole the woman laughed
you're very welcome she said come back this summer and let me know how
had to climb straight up from the ground to the top of the roller coaster hill that would be h tough said jeff
parts one simple machine is an inclined plane
hmm oh
that's right lisa replied
they could see
do you have puddles well
as he ran over the hilltop
there goes puddles can we go after him on our bikes
how about the gears s asked mike
coasted down the hill
jeff hugged him hard
mike was puzzled jeff why did
he'd
the park was called fun station look
cried jeff
engine
puddles pulled up his light light leash
i can see way
watched
jeff wondered how fast they would they were going and he imagined how fast he could go
jeff looked at the woman thank you for bringing puddles out no problem said the woman
attached to a chin chain that wraps around gears when an a range
it's got something to do with the gears answered jeff
a new story
is made your bike is made of silver simple mentions
to his friend mike now try it
while the boys thanked lisa
remember you must turn in your ideas for your science fair project tomorrow
it's a ramp but is a ramp a machine asked mike sure said lisa a machine is anything that helps you do things more easily suppose that you had
engine
since there was puddles digging under the gate oh no he groaned
simple machines have only one or two
where did i go
when they reach the bottom the cars are going fast enough to get up the next hill by by themselves yeah jeff nodded gravity is why the coaster so f fast down the hill on our on our bikes
they could
then over the sounds of the workers they heard a familiar bark from the other side of the fence a woman spoke have you lost your dog yes cried jeff
brakes simply mention called levers
he liked fixing things then he looked up just in time to see his new puppy running up the hill mom he cried
his golden ears flopped up and down as
mom said the fun station was off limits until it opens next summer the boys
jeff's arms
he announced i'm going to figure out how the gears work on my bike jeff smiled he planned the he planned to build a roller coaster for his car collection
to catch their breath
look at those hills mike i'll bet we would
well gravity is a force a force pushes or pulls things
thanks jeff
i'm one of the engineers building the great gravity machine
when they reached the
then mike
first hill is always the highest one
the boys looked down the hill
puddles was nowhere in sight
i was playing with puddles when i heard you call
headed up the hill they saw
gee thanks he said
here it will be easier for puddles if i open the gate
you're very welcome she said come back this summer and let me know
jeff gripped the chain
that
pulls things explained lisa
our your bicycle and the roller coaster both use gravity
said the woman i don't know if it's puddles but i have a friendly little co cocker spaniel here
the ruler the roller coaster in the new jeff
what's the great gravity machine asked jeff
you're right gears are also simple mention
the boys pushed harder at at the pedals as they climbed the steep hill
jeff's mom looked out the window yes but come home in
puddles wiggled to get free but
all other uphill
he'd call it the little gravity machine
shifting make it easier to pedal

this is just type of
europe in order to improve trade
man that is great
his main objection was the to being eaten
one more thing sir
attend
it is interesting to point
and her best friend maggie
that i fear only you can answer she said
of this nonsense said yin yin's mother poo poo
automatically falls in love with them
but everything
all
birds
was very proud of her daughter
replied two hundred thousand and seventy six
said
in
the raw meat he had to feed to the tigers his main
things
despite
so it s
but he was supportive of his young daughter and showed
many people know that pandas eat bamboo
to the moon
an instant later
ob
if you must go it be best to fly nonsense said
there were three pandas and they were known as the panda pan family
said yin yin
said maggie yes but how many more
the what
uncomfortable
i know i shouldn't be telling you this but we might have
the zoo manager
home
oh well that makes sense then
just that there hasn't haven't
once you get over one thousand magpie together they tend
her father
and make her want
if her
he did manage to say i believe rolling
at least
so for fred when it came to pandas he had a warm spot on his heart actually it was
and i've it been
that zoo
consideration that once you get over a thousand magpie together they can tend to fly flight and can't agree on
anniversary
without getting a terrible pain in your neck said owl
and
going to the moon indeed nonsense your job is to be cute
but yin yin the young panda
oh yin yin i wish
re renamed
like what he was supposed to
tree quickly said
she could be a very
to move from their wonderful home but later
such nonsense going to the moon said her mother poo poo
so maggie flew
if
it turns out that owl didn't take
that is
hug
they were talking about since they hadn't thought
many little boy's cheeks have been of raw
and was in terrific shape
i see you wings flapping
when fred walked into
would look
this can almost be certainly
to look at that lady over there
figured that
back at the panda's home
the father watching this all through one eye
so people won't run to the gift shop and buy and bear dolls it's simple economics
human beings
you
me sir that yin yin wanted to be a great explorer
well sir when columbus set
now if you excuse me i need to squeeze something before i scream
could be purchased
and those magpies started fluttering
yin yin w was always one
didn't think it was very proper
but instead became a great explorer
no wait a second
pies flying around
and roll two days
magpie
what a zoo needs is a great
that more stuffed panda bears
that
all
is this fa for a young
it's taken me a couple of weeks to figure it out
she was very proud
and hugs at the zoo
going to the moon
why he
a week later maggie managed
if it weren't for yin yin they would
which young lady help
be my best to ask the owl
they were still trying to get out get
could
in s san angeles
the magpie about going to the moon
be dangerous so all of the people at the zoo would know the pandas had been
in itself will not
before he fell
quite heavy so because
they said together pulling
i'm sorry
who looked a lot like
it turns out was getting the rocket ship
i'm so mad i'm
moo man
further distances pandas have a strange
be
to the hug of
besides if you leave
i
and said what is going on with your pandas fred i've never seen anything like it
i think
did you know that since the little panda built
where
and pandas tend to handle i bamboo
her son cheeks
magpie friends were to the each grab hold of corner
but the point is that
decently round
sure was impressed though
very good at it
hmm heavier than i thought
fred was starting to feel
now while all
how many magpies would be needing to fly a four hundred pound panda bear and one hundred pound bamboo rocket ship to the moon
listening to fred
would come
you had to leave us after all
had fed the pandas
t
consideration
it's not that you aren't selling enough stuffed panda bears
the rather un cuddly palm trees
yin yin
for his advice
of much else since yin yin said i want to go there and pointed to the moon
under
physical fitness was not the only reason that fred loved pandas the other reason was that anyone who gets within
by stain
were birds
it wa
said maggie
one eye
we are spokes
fred fed the panda bears and the tigers and the turtles the turles weren't so bad but as for the tigers he wasn't so sure
makes
yin yin
a business woman
on his ship
profits have gone up just four thousand
exposure we needed
the young
he wanted a business man
s no one could blame fred really since no one really wants to be eaten
is a great idea
but i just learned how to make myself into a ball
about those magpie mag
how to turn your head
turns out
out at this time
the panda
she could think was to say nonsense as for yin yin
it's a law of nature
was not all bamboo
what sort of nonsense
give or take two
after all
was doing
were discussing about
much flapping
fred was not allowed to actually hug the panda bears since that
you and your family to the big zoo
she wanted
and dirty industry
this
his support by taking a nap
she was talking to her best friend maggie
a lot of it a lot of bamboo can get v
so they tired one two three to the moon
a young boy was heard saying ouch mom cut that out
they were in order of cuteness yin yin
obstacle
the mother
at
yin yin said i'm not sure exactly replied maggie
yin yin's father
do you supposed fred
those panda's will
urge
to sell
came up to him
you know
been enough people coming to see you in the first place
said the manager
with there
and less than a week later yin yin and maggie had built a rocket ship out of bamboo bamboo is very workable success
and the three of the strongest
eighty five point five degree spot on his left kidney b
in a
to the yin yins parents fred
said yin yin
becoming
no
a single thing single thing
comedian
after a fabulous explorer
that more people
the magpies want to take her there said fred
was not
pers
so one day after fred
it costs too much if you feed panda bears i would hate if
into
we don't get more money
to the owl and asked
t
most likely not made of cheese and most certainly not to be made of bamboo
ing
panda's home
when mother poo poo panda was upset
but
but we don't seem to be going anywhere
or talked
back at the panda's home
if pandas
be announced for by stay for
and she and maggie never stopped trying to get to the moon
which
why did panda with the beautiful girl name yin yin had her changed to the very beautiful girl name columbus if was fred's idea so let's begin with fred
for he always had at least
like or not
know that
and instead
set out
about the zoo's
me an um
or wise
to take good good advance of h
yes but
fell to sleep
so being eaten was definitely not something he looked forward to each afternoon at three o'clock when it was time to feed the tigers
about fly flying above the pandas do you think
ago
the way around
anniversary
are sold at zoo gift shops then all of the other stuff animals
owl didn't take
one morning fred was feeding yin yin and said
to re
panda bear
i think yin yin wants to go to the moon
to round up two hundred thousand and seventy eight magpie
have to had
her mother and father knew
so before he ran off to hug the palm
he was feeding the pandas
if you were
the rocket in the air
pay for the bamboo and that you eat
then closed his eye
that
yes the big one in the sky
fed wh when they saw fred
to say but
of the pandas fred became very strong
with all their might
what
going
off the ground maggie
the zoo manager laughed and walked away but did purchase a fashionable yellow umbrella for fred the next day
a panda
combined
almost magical effect on
with us for a long time fred thought about it and said you think
the panda
why does that have to do with pandas man said the zoo manager well it seems to me miss
i'll get terribly out of shape
second i don't understand
that bamboo rocket ship
a lot
places where there wasn't any bamboo
of the rocket ship they could all fly
she said spitefully
the main
about way to go
he was very fond of the feeding pandas
i think we need more magpies
i don't think it will take that long to roll there
the
was going on
to visit the zoo
little bird
it's the only
and were hugging the palm tree
it's
that
oh wise owl i have a question
outside of the panda's home
her best friend maggie
three feet of a panda
under his new yellow umbrella
when she wanted
enough a
the mother panda poo poo
the owl instantly
t almost magical effect on the pandas possess
were
us want to hug and squeeze
he didn't mind handling the raw meat and
a week later des
asleep at all times
people with panda stuffed animal
columbus the zoo keeper said good heavens
i see fred
he really t tried to find a quicker way to get around
percent
they
infected l
the two kinds of flowering plants one kind
finding pine sap was easy too
a bush with something white on it
opposite
for my leg
do all plants have seeds most plants do
and the searches
e
his father call i it was no time for grazing in campfires
doesn't have flowers
then he turned to pete
willows
inside fruits
then pete's father slept for hours when he woke
that
finding
was
on an early trip
an exciting discovery
the broken bone in place
that
it's a conf
that's a fine idea
expert
i want you to make me
flowers with groups
of the lessons his father had given him

and pete you're going to be a great flower hunter
the root was fat and bumpy exactly right
a flower hunter too
on the last hunting trip
to know
this is long

the bush had shiny green leaves some leaves
all around him
if you can
scratches
after letting
groups one flower
he thought might be a
gazing into campfires
soon the jar was
pete showed his father the plants
by the river pete l
pete's father felt much better the willow bark
and cone bearing plants have seeds in
with his broken leg wrapped in cloth
were turning red
tiny club moss
had an answer
we'll take some cuttings from this plant
pete and his father had been hunting
father wouldn't have fallen off
look pine cones said pete
of
looking at
from one last test pete dug up
broken called him flower hunter
the white
pete knew he must find the right plant his father
he could find right plants he would have to try

his father
it was fun looking at all those plants pete
s life depended on
he likes science
that
is
like this he brought
botanist
flowering
club moss spores
back to his lessons about plants
asked his father pete opened the cone seeds
his feet hurt
you are feeling better said pete good said father pete
carefully
as pete left
had discovered
and the club moss spores and the pine sap were helping
and roots to find each kind of plant
he was he went closer
pine trees stood
there was a lot to
leg heal
s
to make tea
they are divided into two
each other the stems too
club moss too
he returned to camp
it shook the plants over the small jar
into cr
botanist
awoke
and
with long skinny leaves were growing
he said
some plants don't have flowers pete
hurt he was lying on the ground
but healing would take a long time
his father added
conifer
bear
to see that plant well
the
each leaf had a partner right across from it
lumps of sap off the bark
of
pete felt sad he would his father be all right
he f
his father said in a
it had

pete
the land didn't seem as beautiful now as it
pete

amos
in flowering plants
for
he told him about the strange plant with white flowers too he yes these are
bonus plant he s
him proudly pete and
yes do you want
cone bearing plant it has hard brown cones
there were few towns
the plant and looked at the root
flowers
pete wanted to be
he hurried off into the woods
white
in his pouch
they hiked to the clearing pete's father studied the plant you've made
every flower pete's father had said on
at a campfire pete's father
pete and his father had set
to have a plant named after him
pete yelled at the grazing animal if you had not run from that
then
of plants ex ex
fir tree
a
he knew better than to touch a strange plant but he studied it closely then he then he turned to
heard
what he had learned he
plants have seeds
on his father's leg
pete's father had told him
it was easy to find the willow bark
he said father do you
boiled some water in a cup he put the willow bark
and
of pine sap
flowers the leaves were
too
his
his father was always reminded that pete
at
left the clearing he saw are
on his desk look
when i hold the lamp
when the light
seasons but
look too closely cassie turned the postcard over she laughed a koala bear
pointing to the line around the middle of the globe that's right said matt well
what that
somewhere in africa said
it does
is it c cold in the month of june
this postcard read cassie stood the r
to guess the riddle
every since aunt
since the noon sun is long
cassie thought her brother matt was in high school he
i see a short shadow
i hold the lamp at
the noon sun
only in australia
starting in june and summer in january don't they that's true said matt if it
cassie looked at the postcard it
said matt
she said
where aunt red wig is right again said matt
i can't see that word
have another postcard from aunt red wig matt laughed
of
postcards
we
what's the next clue
him there as she walked to the library cassie read
do you see when i hold the lamp like this cassie looked
the shadow grows longer that's right said matt
is short
you
south
matt it's a koala bear
what's
that's right said cassie australia
month of june
also tells
i wonder how the
high said matt when cassie came to his desk what's new hi said cassie look
had become to travel
public library cassie
was proud of herself
angle
the postcards
then
we
it
aunt red wig i think
aunt
and her riddles
i haven't solved the riddle yet said cassie she looked at the globe on matt's desk
aunt red wig must be somewhere south of the equator cassie thought she looked
wanted to ask matt a question
pretend that this lamp is the sun and
aunt wig
yes i do cassie sh
like the noon sung is the in winter the shadows are longer
none
he
cassie thought for a moment i
on the floor cassie what
at this angel
sun from above the shadow
that the length of shadows
said cassie people who live
look
cassie maybe there's another clue said matt
we never even looked at the picture
but
in the summer so that
riddle
wig
in winter it must be winter where aunt red wig is cassie
worked after school at the
an angel
is high in the sky and
is winter in june
don't they matt nodded
mother's letters aunt red wig took people on trips all over the world
had no postmark or stamp because it had come in a letter to her mother
and aunt r red wing
but
right there
but i don't see what it has to do with the seasons let's
that means you have another riddle to figure out
shadows can tell where
shadows a is short
it for cassie in
can't said matt
the second clue is that the suns sets soon
to the riddle over and over again
on the floor
when
during the summer the
cou
they live
of the equator have winter
has koala bears and winter in june and long winter shadows at noon
what is the picture on the card
tells us what it's winter
i had some ideas but she
length
at i
she had put po
looked to visit
that's right said matt
earlier in the winter aunt
sets soon where
were too busy thinking
she sent cassie always had a riddle about where she was
was from aunt red wig
laughed cassie
i'll ask matt
red wig is in a place where the noon shadows are long said cassie
it's some animal i don't
isn't this the equator she asked
carefully at the globe aunt red wig could be the south america australia or maybe
said matt
do i click this
shadows are the first clue to the riddle can you tell the
but
shadows were long the sun
reached for the lamp
know the sun sets much
which in dogs
the leash since he still needed to heal
came and picked him up and drove him home
realize
one day he took a walk to the dog park and all his friends were there
go away
the other dogs because he didn't have
them a big kiss
never catch him but suddenly he noticed that fleabag was catching up to him and before he knew it
eventually fleabag got to take the collar off but
old
he sprinted to his owners and gave
one day fleabag went to a vet fleabag didn't mind the vet because usually the people
his owners name
to be on his leash at the dog park
fleabag was able to run faster than he could ever remember
when his when his owners it doesn't understand me
o i'm going
which mean in dog talk
want to lick them
oh boy i'm going to lick my leg so
but that didn't stop him from running
the vet to have surgery on his legs
whenever his
fleabag
then
always come
which mean
meant he was allowed to run
he turned his head around to lick his leg but there was a big white thing on his way
into him and knocked him down and said bark bark bark which in dog
you are too slow to catch me with your limp
legs didn't
badly
so fleabag started running after snot
had problems with his back legs that made him
fleabag was
his owners reached around fleabag and took
fleabag
he was wearing a collar that made it
snot
happy that he could run
when his owners found him
fleabag would always chase snot but
boy do you look silly in that ugly collar ha ha ha
which made him a little mad
the
there was a dog
where he was but he sure did want to see his owners
just then snot bit him on the back leg and ran away
come he would sometimes get a yummy treat
was walking with his owners on the leash and they went to the dog park
bark bark bark
but it was nice to see all his friends mean old snot said bark bark bark
which in a
which
fleabag suddenly
as usual
so h
fleabag ran
by then the
which in dog talk means
older now and t
realized that his legs itched very
very carefully
him
in the white coats gave him treats
he was so
for six weeks he could take walks and go to the dog park but he couldn't be let off his leash
why do you have to wear that stupid looking collar
to pick on you
like most dogs he loved to run
hard that
didn't know what to do because he had been on his leash so long
owner said fleabag come
when he awoke up from the surgery he didn't remember
up to fleabag and bite his neck leg and run away saying
the next day he
dogs
talk means don't you ever mess with me again snot
itch so he didn't
dog
s
limp when he ran
he thought
he soon learned that
his leash off
at
that would
possible to lick his legs
fleabag was a puppy he was older
as a puppy he was very dirty so h
fast that
snot was laughing because he knew fleabag could
at his owners
would never catch him
park near where he lived he enjoyed playing with
itching is going to
that was a long time to go when flag bag
soon they
bark
his owners wouldn't let fleabag play without
the the shiny acorn rolled to the door and hit it
so the little field mouse gave the tiny necklace to his
then it rolled under a big
he looked in every little drawer
and ran and ran into the fields
he wanted to go back up the tiny stairs to his own home
at and every day the little red man went away out the tiny door and did not come back until afternoon
it is my acorn i found it said the field mouse
and the little red man never knew where
he set it down
he took it in his paws then
it was such a nice acorn i will take it home he said
his necklace went because he did not know where the little
my bed and clean my room and cook my make my bed and clean my room and cook my food
in a little room
the acorn was rolling down so he went down too
and into the door
she thought it was pretty
a teeny tiny door on the wall
once upon a time there was a little brown field mouse one day he was out in the grass to see what he could see
last he came
had the key
it shut a
he went in
at last one day he was in such a hurry that he turned the key before the door was shut
he did not know where it was he looked
he pushed open the little door he climbed up up up the little stairs
i have it
so the little brown mouse made the little red man's bed and cleaned the little red man's room
inside there was a tiny necklace it was a very pretty necklace it was made of jewels and
then he ran away
but the little acorn rolled away from him he ran after it but it kept rolling
he had a lit he had a little red cap and a little red coat and a little shoes with points
the acorn and down down down went the field mouse
hit it with a tap the little door opened and the acorn rolled inside the field mouse went fast down the stairs
to his little mouse sister
but it was not there he hooked in every closet but could not find it then he got up on a chair and opened
at
but the little door was locked and the little red man
but he always locked the door after him and the and took the key
little mr field mouse ran to the root and poked his nose at the acorn he saw a small hole in the ground
the little field mouse knew that he could run away home but he did not want to go without a the pretty acorn
no it is not said the little red man
then he took it in his mouth
too hard with a little snap it opened like a little box
so he put on so he put out his paw to touch it
field mouse lived
in it there was a funny red man
down down down rolled
you are in my jail he said to the field mouse why said the field mouse because you tried to take my acorn the little red man
when she did not wear it she kept it in the shiny acorn box
there it was his
when he was in his own house he set the k tiny acorn on the table
to his own house
and he said to the mouse you will be mine you will take
and he was
the the door did not lock at all he went away away in a rush
and saw some stairs going down into the earth
everywhere
he came out the hole under the root
you will never see it again the little field mouse looked at the room but he didn't see any acorn
and cooked the little red man's food
just the right size for a girl mouse
it came to a big oak tree with roots all over the ground
at the toes
he saw a tiny door at the foot of the stairs

the man was

then
took this change to
aunt
houston she pu
man
l
in a
hello say
wore two watches and she
and
chris
man left
she said spitefully
what the zoo needs is a great everything
when she wanted
actually it was a eighty five degrees
now if you excuse me i need
i have a question that i fear
it'll it'll take
many a little boy's cheeks
quickly he said it costs so much to
times said
to
in sa in angeles
to sleep he did
and buy panda bear dolls
at further distance pandas have a strange almost magical effect on human
we needed
the main obstacle it's turns out
magpie who looked a lot like a panda if
a lot of bamboo can get quite heavy so because of the pandas fred became very strong
did you know that since the little panda built
bamboo is a very workable substance and pandas
going to the moon said her mother poo poo
rocket ship
though
she was very proud to
was very proud of her daughter
what is going on with your pandas fred
uh actually it was a eighty five
i see fred
the
no wait
the
but everything was not all bamboo
it's a law of nature
just the type of exposure
this can certainly be accounted for
he
yes but how many more
and can't agree on a single thing
ouch mom cut that out
but later when fred walked into the panda's home under a his
no how many magpie
the zoo manager
wo
or take two
must go it will be best to fly
the palm tree
spokespeople
with the pandas man said the zoo keeper manager
fred
so
figured that if
that
reason that fred loved the pandas
to yin yins parents fred sure was impressed though
when columbus set out
are so old at zoo gift shop
i see your wing flapping but we don't seem to be going anywhere said yin yin
the rocket in the air it turns out
that's enough of this nonsense said yin yin's mother poo poo
yes the big one in the sky that is mostly
maggie never stopped trying to get to the moon
for the panda stuffed
had to move from their wonderful home
her mother and father knew i
to hug the panda
said fred
the father watching this all through one eye
and they were known as the pan family
it was very proper for a wise young panda bear to go rolling off to places
i wish that more people would come to visit the zoo
it's only home you know besides
but i just learned how to make how to make myself into a ball and roll in two days
he didn't mind handling with the raw meat he had to feed the ti to the tigers his main objection was to being eaten no one could blame fred really since no one really wants to be eaten some
nonsense said the mother
it's just that we're
later a young boy was
fred was starting to feel
but yin yin panda was not listening to fred
yin yin's father moo man
how to turn your head all the way around without getting a terrible pain in your neck
made raw
i would hate
said
i believe rolling is a decidedly round about way to go
the owl instantly
we are
instead became a great explorer
getting the rocket ship off the ground
fred was not allowed to actually hug the panda bears since that
will be with
pandas were birds
was not that
but physical fitness was not
and those magpies said started fluttering about
one two three to the moon
it is interesting to point out at this
well sir
a week later despite much flapping they were still trying
yin yin said i want to go there and pointed to the moon
renamed after a famous explorer
maggie the magpie about going
if it weren't for yin yin
were discussing
it's taken me a couple weeks to figure out it out but
the uncontrollable
five degrees on his left kidney but the point is that he was very fond of feeding the panda's
do you think that zoo could purchase me a large
one morning fred was feeding yin yin and said
but i just learned
fred fred
a business man but
do you supposed what fred was doing
it's not that you're
think to say was nonsense
a four hundred pound panda bear
for fred the next day
a week later maggie managed to round up two hundred thousand and seventy eight magpie
manager came up to him and said
and instead
were to each grab hold of a corner
i think we should rename yin yin columbus
know that the pandas
the main obstacle
have gone up four thousand percent
anyone
heavier
europe in order to im
of the other stuff animals combined
that once you ever get a thousand magpie
nonsense your job is to be cute so people want to
and most certainly not made of bamboo
yin yin was always one to take good advice from her father
which young lady helps for pay for the bamboo
hadn't talked
before he ran off to hug the palm
made
had at least one
were
but we m
and showed his support by taking a nap
and a one hundred
leave
ago and i'm becoming very good at it
so maggie flew to the owl and
do like to bite their finger nails but fred wasn't a nail biter so being eaten was definitely not something he looked forward to each afternoon at three o'clock when it was time to feed the tigers
coming
her son
an instant
companion
i don't think it will take that long to roll there said yin yin
only you can answer she said
to squeeze something before i scream
uh
have been
feed you panda bears
did manage to say
if we don't get more money
to the moon said maggie
it's simple economics like it or not
a lot like a panda would look if
beings which makes us want to hug and squeeze things
those panda's
it the main obstacle it turns out was
was in terrific shape
that bamboo rocket ship
tend to handle bamboo a lot so this itself
they hadn't thought or talked of much else since
the panda's room
i don't understand
they could all fly to the moon so they tried
she was talking to her best friend
be
after all
n
one more thing sir about those magpies flying above the pandas
i've never seen anything like it
and hugs at the zoo
rather un cuddly palm tree outside of
no wait a second
now while this was going on do you suppose
that
by this strange almost magical effect that the panda possess
name columbus it was fred's idea so let's begin with fred
wanted a busi to be
yin yin said i'm not sure exactly replied maggie
i'm sorry to say but
new yellow umbrella all she could
would be needed to fly
laughed and walked away but did purchase a fashionable yellow umbrella
t'would would be best
give or take two
well it seems to me sir that yin yin wanted be great explorer
the zoo
thought about it and said you know
all the other people at the zoo would
her and three of her strongest magpie friends
zoo's profits
the other reason was that
i know
that the owl didn't take consideration
on his ship he was really trying to find a quicker way to get around
then all
hmm
what sort of nonsense is this for young panda bear going to the moon indeed
no
not mostly likely not made of cheese
animal industry
knew what they were talking about since they hadn't
for he always
they
so
but many a little boy's cheeks have been
i know i shouldn't be telling you this
but where there wasn't any bamboo but he was supportive of his young daughter
roll two days
to ask the owl then closed his eye
if you
it's just that there hasn't been enough
i'm so mad i'm going to look at that lady over there and make her want to squeeze
people
heard saying
said owl
didn't
the zoo manager
t'wouldn't
made raw when mother poo poo panda was upset
if you had to leave us
replied two hundred thousand and seventy six
if you
yes but what does that have to do
spoke
after fred had fed the pandas and was hugging
maggie
could be dangerous
us for a long time
astonishing at least
only
that
that's
to get
they said together pulling with all their might
time that more stuffed panda bears
well sir
another that's enough of this
and she and
to the moon
they would they would have
were discussing about going to the moon
sized umbrella
there were three panda's
i think yin yin wants to go to the moon and magpies want to take her there
urge
didn't think
oh yin yin
how to
after all
like he was feeding the pandas like he was supposed to so one day
you aren't selling enough stuffed panda bears
fred fed the panda bears and tigers and turtles the turtles weren't so bad but as for the tigers he wasn't so sure
as for yin yin she was very
back in the in the panda's home the mother panda poo poo
she could be
and instead become a business woman
fred
of
the k the zoo keeper said good heavens man that is a great idea
had just been had just been fed when they saw fred hugging
it turns out
this is
who gets within three feet of a panda automatically falls in love with them
together they tend to fight
than i thought i think we will need more magpies said maggie
trade
why did a panda with the beautiful girl name yin yin have her name changed to
this
run to the gift shop
yin yin and her best friend maggie
was
and less than a week later yin yin and maggie had built a rocket ship out of bamboo
that you eat such such nonsense
oh well that makes sense then said the manager
many people know that pandas eat bamboo a lot of it
for
in order of cuteness yin yin the young daughter poo poo the mother and moo man the gentle and always sleepy father
eye asleep at all
tree
i'm sorry to say but
pound bamboo rocket ship
might have to sell you and your family to the big zoo
but before he fell
asked for his advice oh wise owl
i don't think
i'll get terribly out of shape
a very perceived little bird
to see the first place i think
i'm so mad i'm going to look at that lady over there make her want to squeeze her son cheeks
for fred when it came to the panda's he had a warm spot in his heart
the next day
we can now we can watch the leaf flow through the ra rapids a said uncle don the water is faster too laurel added you're right again
then she looked into the river how deep is the rio grande grande she asked
this is where we'll put our rafts in the water she said she moved her hand down the rio grande river then she stopped
that night they came on the river bank under the stairs in the morning the river looked even lower
uh lighter she's thought
uh when laurel's boat leaned against the rocks she laughed as the raft turned and tossed at last the r
uh she had one sinking thought
that's rock slide uncle don said mysteriously we'll need plenty of daylight when we reach i'll i'll also have to repack the rafts very carefully
one of his river trips
now we can estimate the way of some fruit uhm and make a shopping list
she learned that a safe trip has nothing to do with luck you must carefully plan and measure your load if you want to master the rio grande at rock slide
then the re rest of the r
water uncle don answered in summer people need lots of water each day
wow the wet pair is about twice as long
laurel looked at the water it was darker near the cliffs it must be deeper there she thought
early in the afternoon uncle don decided to stop and camp why are we stopping now laurel asked
don the more you eat the lighter the r rafts will be when we get to rock slide
what is rock slide asked laurel
as they turned to the next bend on the river laurel saw the other r rafts resting on the bank
liter plastic bottles with water and freeze them
let's find out by estimating said uncle don he pushed an oar into the water until it hit the bottom then he pulled it out
laurel watched uncle don load the rafts with supplies the rafts sank lower into the water as he piled the cooking gear
laurel looked down into the canyon there ws a lazy rio grande turned into fast
the next morning everyone got on the rafts laurel you ride with your mother today said uncle don laurel looked at the rafts the food and chests and water jugs were almost empty
we don't want the raft to be too heavy he wants us to fill our big cooler with fruit and ice we'll measure everything in pounds because that's how we'll we'll buy the fruit
and two bunches of grapes at the store laurel and her mom carefully weighed the fruit on the list it weighed thirty four pounds
i can see little rocks at the bottom
uhm asked laurel
she looked at the green patch on the left and read the words big bend national park
what is the r what's a rock slide laurel was puzzled
uhm was thirty one kilograms
all around her water roared as it crashed over the rocks
the rafts seemed much higher in the water
are we going to ride any big rapids asked laurel not until rock slide done uncle don smiled
eat up l laughed uncle don
and this is and this is rock slide
i bet it's shallow it's a shallow rock slide
the raft reached the canyon floor
a tried happy group
he said the filled uhm cooler w can't weigh more than seventy two pound our cooler weighs thirty pounds we can fill two three l
rock slide uncle don climbed in uh climbed the rocks overlook rock slide everyone followed
laurel listened to the roar she wondered how a rock slide could make such a sound it took long time for her to fall asleep that night
in his letter uncle don said we must carefully measure the weight of everything we bring
on the way to the store laurel wrote her list fourteen apples fourteen oranges and twenty bananas two melons and two pineapples
uh river
laurel stared at the ripples it's shallow she said
laurel spread on the tax texas map out on the dining room table
that's one and a half meters uncle don looked worried the river is low it is going to be a rough trip through the rock slide
laurel was surprised uncle don had measured everything carefully before the trip she was glad that uhm they had been so careful with the fruit each person h uhm put on a life jacket laurel's mass
as soon as uhm laurel huddled in the middle of the speeding raft all around the water uhm
listen whispered uncle don above the splashing laurel could hear a faint roar
it's a surprise of the trip mom answered with a smile we've got to pack our clothes and pick up some fresh fruit for uncle don uncle don was laura laurel's favorite uncle this year he promised to take them on a ri on
the river had disappeared into a mountain of rocks
each one will weigh four pounds that means we can bring thirty pounds of fruit said laurel exactly said mom
they had survived rock slide but laurel had learning something learned something too
what rock slide could be as they paddled small rapids rippled in the distance why do rapids look different in the then the
compare the wet part of the oar to with the ice chest the ice chest is about eight centimeters long
fierce rapids uncle don told everyone how to travel through the rapids stay close to the sides of the cliffs he said
that was a pretty good estimate mom said yes but i'd better take off some fruit
look at the water uncle don explained what's what is a different about the water in the rapids
right
laurel rode in uncle don's raft she climbs on top of the duffle bag and watched uncle don pull his oars through the water
uncle don smiled just wait you'll find out soon
paddles pulled their wa their water pulled through the water rafts bounced uhm off the canyon walls
uncle don is making his raft higher
lonely life
tried to walk like a peacock
don't don't be cheat
but she could not talk
then they came to a town people looked up and
or if you open your mouth you will fall
how can we take you with us
the tortoise and the duck lived together for a long time
that was the end of the tortoise
to them don't
the two
her very good friends she liked the ducks
this is funny look it

he had always hated
tree toads leaned their funny song from him this is

she so she kept still
once upon a time a tortoise lived in a pond with a duck two ducks
the tortoise wanted to say be quiet
the tortoise said she would
they did not know what to think at first did
the ducks felt bad they had a an idea of how to take her
the ducks and
the crow was glad to get away alive he flew back to his own family and old friends but one of the crows had seen him in the barnyard and told the others he was silly he h
we will not have you in this flock away away

they were going to fly away

the tortoises liked to talk

saw them look at the ducks carrying a tortoise they said everyone to went ran to look
the peacocks came into the yard
where have you been they cried we know we know

then a pond ran out of water
be
ducks could not live without water
look at it
she could talk with them as much as she liked
if you
she was very happy so the ducks got a strong stick and held the ends the tortoise bit the middle
from a peacock he picked these up with his bill and placed them on his own
they flew at him calling away with the cheat away with the cheat they pulled out all the peacock feathers
made eyes
in
a warning
tortoise had no water to swim in
then
but she did not
they were
not say a word she would not even make her mouth
they saw a pretty house she wanted to say what is that but she kept quiet
then they saw that the crow was trying to dress like
and they drove him away even the owls will
how silly he had been acting
we have a way to take you they said but you must not move we will each take one end of a stick
the
don't be be cheat
talk
to more water they went to the tortoise to say goodbye
the tortoise forgot the stick she opened her mouth to say hush she fell to the ground
take me with you i will die if i stay here but you can not fly said the ducks
she liked the sound of her voice
they were high over the trees the tortoise wanted to say how high we are
at his fine new coat he even tried to
don't b
many of his black ones
cheat
there in a tree by a pond lived a
from the next room aunt helen spoke it's only the foghorn net net
it's like a lighthouse for the ears
instead of letting the breeze slip under it the way a sheet did the sail caught the breeze
red sky in the morning sailors take warning
they climbed in and aunt helen rowed sailboat
of the boat
up the fog soon sunlight will warm the air
asked newt
aunt helen explained
net
that we talk
newt asked don't worry
air pushes the warm land air out of the way a breeze blows from the ocean land
on the town dock
in the evening the wind
two hours later the boat neared the island and entered a cove newt steered the boat toward so sandy beach then aunt helen dropped
so the air above the water is cooler than the air above the land
aunt helen moved the sail to catch more wind
aunt helen pointed up see it
the sail reminded
what happened to the wind he asked it's just the afternoon afternoon
the at said
had cleared
con
on the boat as they raised the sail
net decided that tomorrow would be a fine day for sailing on the wind
when the cooler land air pushes the warm ocean air out of the way we get a breeze from land to ocean
a motor boat newt asked
the fog was beginning to clear
all newt could hear was waves slapping on the beach
net wake woke to a hazy world
newt untied the rope that held the boat he could not feel the boat begin to move
the red sun settled down on the western horizon the rosy
when it
newt asked
motors are noisy replied aunt helen i like the peace and quiet of sailing
sometimes there's no wind but i know that soon the wind will blow again
there's no wind at all
the cool land air pushed the warmer ocean air out of the way so now the wind is coming from land
is begin to cool
sailing
at six thirty the wind picked up
this fog won't last long she said
in the
aunt helen owned a small sailboat it had a tiny cabin
a long low sound awakened le
after newt and aunt helen ate they explored the island
net asked
the land in sea are just about the same temper temperature so there's no wind
it pushes it out of the way said net
right now the wind is coming from the ocean
telltale
of a sheet hanging on a clothesline
let's ask the sunset
they carried their picnic lunch and oars down a sandy path to the dock
is that magic or what
condensed
she said
aunt helen laughed
net ran to the open window you couldn't see the lights in town he couldn't see the moon
we're fogged in he crawled back to bed and soon dreamed again
why doesn't the wind always go the same way
cast off the morning line aunt helen said
the front of the boat moved to the right
they planned to sail to an island and spend
red sky at night sailors take delight
what if you're far from land and you can't see the flag
if the wind stops then you can go anywhere
noticed that the air was still
about the mainland
then we can go
there's going to be a good wind after six o'clock aunt helen said why don't we collect some shells while we wait
she had promised to take him sailing on her boat
the day exploring it
to the land
blows out from the land
the anchor and they to shore
s aunt helen said
do you know what cool air does to warm air asked aunt helen
you sail by knowing the direction of the wind she said
it's called a
doldrums
newt of
newt and aunt helen had put on life jackets
i want to learn how to sail can we go again tomorrow aunt helen smiled will tomorrow be a good day for sailing
net watched it snap in some strong breeze
aunt helen smiled no
he watched water drip from the porch roof
in the daytime the ocean is cooler than land
i'm going to teach you to stir aunt helen said
moved the tiller toward the right the boat turned left
glow of clouds stretched across stretched across the sky and turned
i tie a piece of red yarn to the top of the mast
there's no wind at all
net helped raise the sail on the mast a pole rising from the center of the boat
by ten thirty the fog
it cools faster than the ocean
from the land
the temperature dropped last night the water vapor is in the air
aunt helen decided to get back
this is the tiller you use it to s you use it to steer the boat
did you ever want
the white sail pink
evening the op opposite happens because the land cools off more quickly than the ocean does
as he ate blueberry muffins
from his dreams honk honk sound stopped
they returned to the beach late in the afternoon
it's the changing temperatures
neat newt said
but how will we get home again
right when cool ocean
how do you know net asked one d one way is to look at the flag in town dock
this is the morning breeze blowing in from the ocean
but the sail tied at the corners
a rowboat drifted from a rope tied to the dock
she pushed the til the tiller toward the left side of the boat
what will that tell us she said
the into water droplets that make
why not newt asked
the foghorn doesn't sound to tell us it's foggy sounds to warn sailors about rocks and land
the night air felt cold and damp
out of water the ducks and the tortoise had no water to swim in the two ducks could not live without water they were going to fly away to more water they went to the tortoise to say goodbye
held the ends the tortoise bit the middle then the two ducks flew away with their friend
you
once upon a time a tortoise lived in a pond with two ducks
she opened her mouth to say
people looked up and saw them look at the
if you open your mouth you will fall
we have
would not even
to
so she kept still
how high
then you
will fly up in the air with you
i stay here but you can not fly said the ducks
say a word
her very good friends she liked the ducks she could talk with them as much as she liked the tortoise liked to talk
the tortoise it was very good to be able to be quiet
we are but she could not talk
but she did not
but you must not move
so they got
together for a long time
she wanted to say what is that
they were high over the trees the tortoise want to say
take the middle of your mouth
oh don't leave me said the tortoise take me with you i will die if
the tortoise said she would not
hush she fell to the ground that was the end of
they were
ducks carrying a tortoise they said everyone ran to look the tortoise wanted to say be quiet
have a way to take you they said
move her mouth she was very happy
she liked the sound of her voice the tortoise and the ducks lived
they saw a pretty house
then they came to a town
but do not to talk
how can we take you with us take me with you take me with you said the tortoise the ducks felt bad they had an idea of how to take her
she
she liked
the stick was in her mouth
that is funny look at that look they said the tortoise forgot t the stick
we will each take one end of a stick
so the ducks got a strong stick and
then the pond ran
but she kept quiet

the little spiders had gone victor sadly walked back to the house

moss grass and stones
he also knew that he had to do
when victor returned with tommy he saw

black widow mr foster answered
he glanced sadly to clara's cage that
he ran straight to the barn

victor carried the spider
goodbye little spiders he said
but clara didn't move tommy looked closer

tommy and victor studied the spider book
that spider is no space creature but she is dangerous

mrs garcia said
the book explained that the sac from a

with a wire screen then the boys returned to the
he picked the aquarium and carried it outside

the boys and mr f
i found a spider in the grass

a lot faster than they do now i think they may be sick did you feed your fish tom asked mr chu yes sir i put just a little food
can i help you asked the man at the pet store
chu said tom i want my fish to be happy
we look at the fish here in the store you can show me what kind of goldfish you have that might help that might help us find out what is wrong with your pets tom and mr
it traps dirt that collects that collects in the water
i have two fish
tom w would never forget to feed his fish he took very good care of them they were his first pets he had gotten
is that why my fish are sick maybe said mr chu
the tanks were full of all kinds of fish
pushes the water through a filter answered mr chu
to the top and eat it they make funny faces when they eat it they then they wiggle and swim away tom said
well maybe i can help
tom looked at the bubbles in the fish tanks
pet store
bi bubbles big why are some small
bowl
if you don't use a pump you must change the water twice a week said mr chu
s some bubbles have more air in them than other bubbles
filled with bubbles why do you put bubbles in the fish tanks asked tom it looks like the fish are taking a bubble bath
to keep our fish healthy we clean
the the pump
on the top of the water i like to watch them swim to the
i think my goldfish are sick tom said
t
mr chu walked to the back of the
when the water comes out of the pump it is clean tom looked at the fish but they couldn't stop th thinking about the bubbles mr chu why are some bubble
have two fish t said tom their names
them for his birthday he loved to watch them swim and play in their
how often do you change the water in the bowl i haven't changed it said tom
they were also
these bubbles are filled with air explained mr chu fish need to breath air
the filter works like a net
tell me about your goldfish the man said
don't forget to feed your fish called tom's mother
my fishbowl doesn't have an air pump he said there are no bubbles of air in the water
chu what seems to be wrong with melvin and m
he gave them both names the gold one was named melvin the black one he called
when you give your fish fresh water they'll start to feel better they will get plenty of air to breathe thank you mr chu
it sounds like you are feeding them the right way it's good that you take care of your pets said mr chu why don't you
a bubble holds air just like a balloon said mr chu the more air you blow into a balloon the bigger it gets
but i think you are right why don't you go to the pet store maybe someone there can tell you what is wrong
air and water

the little

what
so hard
know
up at
see the big deal i think it really like its haircut the only reason it hasn't come out for two weeks is because you it guys made sure a big deal about it poor kitty
that we saw on t v on the animal channel i knew our cat would grow her fur back
blazing in the fire till as i gaze with starry eyes the armies fade
have you got good grades to know if you should teach a cat
th
gerbils gerbils and
op
an then once again the glow returns again
she's
grounded me and told me to write down why i am sorry before i was alone out of my room i am
i was afraid to tell you the really reason i sha shaved the cat was that i went want to be a barber and i needed
so it was really my father
not mrs casper
so good at school and you bought her a cat
i do each time and soon she would have an invisible coat of cat fur armor
pressure and you know what these stupid gerbils didn't even thank me
talk
actually
the lamps now enter down the street
but her hairless cat and they need fur in
getting all hot and uncomfortable and stuff
overheat in winter
the
was that he's always sneezing around it
a cat and i get a stupid turtle anyways turtles don't do anything except poke their heads out and be not cuddly can i get a dog please so in conclusion i'm getting hungry and i'm sorry for shaving the cat
hair clippers and shaved it
armies marches go
and did stupid things that's the last time
are very mean to make me do this because it wasn't even my fault i couldn't help it anyway it was an accident and i
how come jenny's gets
ha
oh yeah i forgot
could take her on t v
so
anyway you wouldn't always take the cat's side if you side knew the stuff he didn't did to me my poor turtle
it looks and
but my stupid sister never thought her cat how to listen so
even slower falls about the garden trees and walls
instead
to guess
this and poor kitty
you use
valley lo
won't like to start by saying that i think
then i did on the cat cause now i have
went when
gift to him so i couldn't buy him
be a super cat
what
that it's
and trying to roll me over
accident turn on the nose hair clippers and the cat was being chased by the turtle and ran right by the clippers and shaved herself i kept saying no kitty
aces for her big stupid face
feet and the blue
i mean it's be summer soon enough and i just want
would
plus i forgot to tell you that
you would have a better
have bought her a turtle
on my toes or sure it's easy to say that i should have just picked the cat up and but something we don't always think all that great under
furnaces furnaces
a shave the cat to protect any stupid gerbils
arm
ok here's what happened as i remember it i saw
you gaze will just probably say it's winter
and st
and something even darker
tonight
lots of money so that you can send jenny to college
did you know that i want
but the real reason
army armies march by tower and spire
if i had a cat i wouldn't teach it
the cat likes being
got really hot plus oscar my turtle told me to shave the cat
this
the dies
to shave itself
you told us to
the phantom city burns and down the red hots
oh
on the s
practice i was afraid you wouldn't let me practice on my own head can i
mad at you are i
my science teacher she m made us shave something for science ask her she said that
father's day
cause she's so responsible and stuff
then she would
but if he could he she would have said please shave the cat it keeps hitting me on the shell
they just ran and
the truth is that i by
families sound the falling
the winter sometimes i think i swear that's the reason also i was going to sell the cat fur and buy my sister jenny s jenny
but so what if it's winter
plus if you were always cuddling with my sister so much maybe she
i know how much you get him always sneezing and stuff so i thought if i got rid of his fur he wouldn't sneeze and that
all oh you can see that it's really jenny's fault for not being as responsible as you always say and not brushing her teeth p s if you could
you shouldn't be proud of me for thinking so fast
blinding ambers tell me true where are these armies marching to and what the burning city is that crumbles in your
i sh
didn't even do it on purpose i really didn't mean to shave the cat really i swear
ex
you that mom and dad jenny didn't brush her teeth last night i think that she should brush her teeth twice
shows and get
drew i'll get you didn't know something else
flickers on the back of books
cat's aren't always nice just like my sister jenny isn't always nice
she just ignored me she says not so responsible after all
the cat came into my dad and because jenny never plays with it enough
using to the ideas before it
dear mom don't let dad know that the real reason i shaved the cat
we couldn't hit animals so i didn't know what else to do so i grabbed dad's nose
the
wheel
that you
anything nice since you took away my allowance for when i shaved the neighbor's dog
her shave hair it grew back
went dad called life
that she didn't brush her teeth
on your
opinion
the empty room the warmly on the roof
your fault really dad please don't read the next part
when you leave the room you guess never like oscar as much as the cat
no don't shave yourself
eve
have been with her cat
the cat
so i it really
you should be blaming mrs
i couldn't have shaved it sincerely danny
a lot of a bunch of times her hair would grow back
pr
beside the real reason i shaved the cat was to keep it nice and cool i just didn't want to see the cat
armies in the fire
danny cats don't
that the cat was trying to get
so i thought that i if i could shave the cat
not that i shaved the cat
that's just my
even if she is a dumb little tattle tale
since dear mom and dad parents since you have
ed to do a barb
of city
i shaved the cat was to make a wig for those poor was hairless cats
to not shave itself that's for sure
b
saved away so i don't
that makes it much clearer
he said the jackal and said the little jackal does it

the they both jumped back when they lo when the log when the log splashed and dragged itself up the bank wow
one saturday judy ann and bryan were riding
you might say we in
he he
it waits quietly in the water
de listened to the children's breathing n n news
then the animal turned his dark i
the truck pulled a trailer with a boat bryan and judy ann looked up looked up at donor at dr thomas
it can easily hold them close
call call dr bob thomas said the fireman said the fireman said
stand a little father away if you want to watch continued dr thomas as he walked down the toward the animal
it was black black and tan
until something comes back
what do we do asked bryan let's call the fire department said judy ann
i use these to catch the alligator he said the handle is the handle is square to keep the pole from twisting while i use it
and dragged it t to the shore
do i read out loud loud
there
he took a long pole out of his truck
come se come see the alligator judy ann
see those bands he asked
i i'll
maybe we can help it get back in where it belongs
slowly now don't send waves to the warn
mr degas
his front front and back legs
louisiana
home deep in the swamp
asked judy ann
i've seen the alligators before but but never this close bryan said
eased to himself to gent
dr thomas explained
toward dr thomas and tried to dive
sizes
he smiled through the curly brown and gray be
all about
i would have to use a trap
grown alligators may eat just about anything
only its head still showed
gently
snaps up
now that's a good idea answered mr
there he was able to sit on the alligator
they lived next door to each a
dr thomas had captured the alligator
they were crossing the bridge over the creek when suddenly bryan stopped
on each end
the loop closed tightly around its neck
he quickly pulled
an invaded our our neighborhood said bryan
dr thomas pulled
it's waiting for a lunch right now said bryan usually dr thomas
go get my dad said bryan
the alligator
close down on its prey
deal dialed the emergency number and explained
at night judy ann and bryan could hear the sounds
bryan and judy ann bryan and judy ann looked at the alligator
see it
i'll see
their bi
eased
invaded its neighborhood
eyes toward dr thomas
because alligators come in different sizes
he's at the louisiana nature the science center
he was very t tall
otherwise it would be t too dangerous to catch it by by hand
i would use
dr thomas is a scientist he knows all
its wet bumpy hide shone shone in the sun then it crawled back in into the muddy water
what do alligators eat bryan asked well dr thomas answered
now this a good idea
then the alligator snaps it
there was able
why is why is one loop bigger than the other asked judy ann
there to tell
bryan and judy bryan and judy ann were best friends
finally the alligator grew too tired to struggle
their bicycles
the pole had loops
as it struggled fiercely to get away
cried
ok let's go
bet
to the warn
deal
to
now
a creek ran behind their house
dr thomas would find a place where would be far from people
there's there's something down in the creek see
that was going to catch the alligator and take it to a place far away from where people live
answered dr thomas
beard
dr thomas took some some big black rubber bands from his pocket
reptiles
i don't want that alligator getting cassie my cat my cat declared judy ann
but usually they eat fish frogs turtles and snakes
gently into the creek's brown water
degas
its meal and tosses it down its throat
he tied up
each other in small town west of new orleans
now it was time to put the alligator in the boat and bring it to a new
what's up
sure enough a big alligator was resting on the bank of the creek
alligators can run for a short distance but they can't run fast so why don't you stand
to
dr thomas pulled the alligator to the surface
they had heard plenty of alligator stories from their parents and grandparents now they had a tale from their own
a back black rubber band from its pocket
dr thomas laughed alligators live here long before people did that
pulled on a high black boots
mr
explained when a alligator wants to eat
explained the alligator to the about the alligator
soon dr thomas arrived in a in a truck that had wildlife rescue painted on it
but once the jaws are shut
sounds of the frogs and insects that lived near the creek
then they looked at each other
see it looks like there's a bumpy old log
eagerly does it seem to you right that this
if
cool of my shade and eat my fruit off my branches but then evening comes
where were you said the little jackal why in the cage of course roared the tiger well excuse me mister tiger said the little jackal i'm really
what's a matter albert she asked this mean old jar will not let me have this handful of nuts cried albert
opinion
at last the tiger agreed to wait they would ask the first the first five people they met we whether it was fair for him to eat the brahmin if they decided it was right the brahmin would let the tiger eat him
i don't know why you would let somebody eat you
the bull looked up
brahman
it locks like this said the brahmin and he shut the bolted door
let the tiger eat the brahmin
i'm mixed up on those two words
small for his fit he pulled and pulled and became very angry at the jar
tiger out the moment he was out he jumped on the brahmin and was about to eat him up
do you think it
and
but at last he went on again with the brahmin and after a time they saw an eagle flying in the sky
opinion

that they had asked only four wait til we ask one more wait until we see a fifth he begged

and he spoke in a
me with arrows men are cruel let the tiger eat the brahmin

to to ask was an old
the brahmin
as for you my friend he said to the tiger i think you'll wait a good while before you find anyone to let you out again then he bowed to the brahmin goodbye brother he said you
one day a brahman was looking on a country road when he came upon a tiger shut up in a strong iron cage the villagers had caught him and shut him up there for being wicked
you would not it is not fair for
the tiger sprang to eat the brahmin but the brahmin said wait wait
slime at the river's edge brother alligator
is fair that this tiger t tiger should eat me when i set him free from a terrible cage excuse said the little jackal
he climbed up on the table and put his hand
tell
they may a
my young and rob my
after i have just
never in the world would i do such a bad thing just let me out
illustrated by stephen t smith
then he tried to pull his ha
him but the brahmin said wait wait
at last the tiger stopped
there
they met the little jackal coming happily down the road toward them
the boy and the nuts
you set him free you say
the tiger grumbled
patience
sees me he throws stones at me and pokes me with sharp sticks men are worthless let the tiger eat the brahmin
my optional
i do no man any harm yet when
then i can understand in a jiffy
brother br banyan said the
there were you i stood by the roadside said the brahmin
and spoke in
at last he began to scream and and cry his mother ran to the room
never brother brahman said tiger
it is perfectly right
i'll never understand talk like that
a fair thing that this tiger should eat me up
i hunt no man but every d time i see
albert let go of the nuts and took only two his hand came out easily when you get into trouble ian stop and think of a way to fit it instead of screaming said his mother and next time don't be so greedy
and this tiger and at and this the tiger tried to eat the brahman
tiger should eat me when
i get this said the little jackal brahmin there
and they are rested
s
make it clear
the first thing they came to
and said in a deep grumbling voice when i was young and strong my master used my h
what but this is enough for this story
i set him free from his cage
oh does it really said the little jackal does it really well brother brahmin now that now that it is locked i think you should tell let it stay locked
but it was no use his hand was stuck
but brother tiger said brahmin you promised you would not
which of them means
it
slime and
the brahmin called up to him oh brother eagle
a glass jar full of nuts was on a table albert who loved nuts saw it
opinion
yet when men find my babies they st they stone
oh i'm so sorry said the little jackal i know i w i am very slow i never understand things well unless i see just how they ar were if you would just show me how the doors works
the tiger sprang to the brahmin
finally the tiger walked on with him after a time
brahmin
jumped on the brahmin to eat him up this time the brahmin had to work very hard to keep him off
you promised to ask five
why the cage he was in said the jack said the brahman i m you see but i don't understand said the little jackal
the tie
said the brahman we want you to know what you think do you think oh said the jackal you want me o
you need to have just a little patient
i live here in the air he said and i do not
an iron one said the brahmin
a banyan tree is a kind of fruit tree
that gives me no idea at all said little jackal listen my friends if we are going to get to the bottom of this you'd better show me the spot then
he leaves me without food or water
i am so thirsty and there's no water here but brother tiger said brahman you know if i let you out you would jump on me and eat me up
should i read over again
and
for you to eat me when i set you free
and i saw the tiger oh dear oh dear said the ja little jackal
the brahmin went up to him and said brother bull oh brother bull does it seem to you
in the mud and grunted and snorted then he said i lie here in the mud all day as harmless as a bird
the tiger jumped up
his mother laughed when she saw the cause of his trouble you greedy boy you don't f need a whole handful at once she said try taking a few at a time
there you were said the little jackal
the poor brahman had to re remind him again and again that
computer at home but i don't it has like games you can play
do you think said the brahman it is right for the tiger to eat me when i set him free from his cage
what happened you need to just
is fair that the tiger should eat me when i set him free from his cage
cage was it
used me hard i served him well i carried heavy loads and carried them far now that i am old and weak i cannot
banyan tree and the road
oh brother brahman
you got that way and i'll go this way
we have asked only one
for
oh brother alligator said the brahmin does it seem right to you that this tiger wants to eat me up
us if it seems fair that this tiger should eat me up when i have just saved him from a a frightful cage the eagle soared slowly overhead a moment then he came lower
into the jar he grabbed a whole handful
they may i ask you two speak a little more loudly and be more clear i'm a little slow now that now what was it
my nest and shoot at
freed him from the cage
out a little minute to get a little little drink of water please brother
do you know what a brahman is a brahman is a very good and gentle kind of man who lives in india and who treats all the animals as if they were his brothers
thankless
yes but i don't see any lock said the little jackal does it lock on the outside
brahmin and brahmin
so the brahmin unlocked the door and let the tiger out
his hand out the mouth of the jar was too small
and they walked on together in a little while they saw an old alligator he was lying in a mud and slime
oh brother jackal dear brother jackal said the brahman get us your optional
a good deal
the boy and the nuts modified by taylor
how were you in the cage what p
what
they
thank
show me the cage so then the brahmin and the tiger and the little jackal walked back together to the spot where the cage where the cage was now let me see if
brahmin
position were you in
ran to the room to see what was wrong with him
and tiger
in a tired voice in the summer he said when the sun is hot men come and sit in the
with a long story if you really want my op
and i will eat you up said the tiger but brahmin argued so hard that a last
i think it i'll ask matt cassie thought
so what also tells us it's winter where aunt red wing is
alright now press next
she looked carefully at the globe aunt red wing could be in south america or australia or maybe she's somewhere in africa said cassie
yes i do cassie said shadows are the first clue to the riddle can you tell the seasons by the length of shadows
and long winter shadows at noon said matt and aunt red wing and her riddles riddles laughed cassie
where is it cold in the month of june she had some ideas but the
look too closely cassie turned the postcard over
cassie took out
since the noon noon sun is low in winter it must be winter where aunt red wing is cassie was proud of herself
that's right said matt
public library cassie liked to visit him there as she walked to the library cassie read the riddle over and over again
what is the picture on the card
but i don't see what it has to do with the seasons let's pretend that this lamp is the sun said matt when the light shines from above the shadow is short during the summer the noon sun is high in the sky and shadows are shorter
well said cassie people who live south of the equator have winter starting in june and summer in january don't they that's true said matt
hi said matt when cassie came
that's right said cassie australia has
it was from aunt red wing ever since aunt red wing had begun to travel she had put postcards for cassie in mother's letters aunt red wing wing took people on trips all over the world the postcards she sent cassie always had a riddle about where she was this postcard read
what's the next clue the second clue is that the suns sets soon cassie thought for a moment
the two is in the way right here
is in winter the shadows are long
right again said matt
maybe there's another clue said matt
you certainly can said matt he reached for the lamp on his desk look on the floor cassie what do you see when i hold the lamp like this cassie looked to the floor i see a short shadow she said
ok
but
but i haven't solved the riddle yet said cassie she looked at the globe on matt's desk isn't isn't this the equator she asked pointing to a line around the middle of the globe that's right said matt
she laughed a koala bear look matt it's a koala bear they live only in australia don't they matt nodded we were so busy trying to guess the riddle that we never even looked at the picture
cassie looked at the postcard it had no postmark or stamp because it had come in a letter to her mother
a
that's right said matt
when i hold the lamp at an angle like the n noon sun
noon shadows are long the sun sets soon
it's some animal i didn't
aunt red wing is in a place where the noon shadows are long said cassie
but when i hold the lamp at this angle the shadow grows longer
if it is winter in june then aunt red wing must be somewhere out south of the equator cassie thought
to his desk what's new hi said cassie look what i have another postcard from aunt red wing matt laughed that means you have another riddle to figured out
koala bears and winter in june
cassie studied the riddle i wonder how the length of shadows can tell where aunt red wing is
to ask matt a question
i know the sun sets much earlier in the winter than it does in the summer
when they reach the bottom the cars are going fast is enough to get up the next hill by themselves
in your ideas for your science fair project tomorrow
sure said lisa a machine is anything that helps you do things more easily suppose that you had to climb straight up from the ground to the top of the roller coast of that roller coaster hill
the park was called fun station look at those hills mike i i'll bet we could need some big gears i bet we would
his golden ears flopped up and down as he ran over the hilltop the boy pushed the boys pushed harder on the pedals as they climbed the steep hill
eating this meat when i get home said bill the dog he began to cross a
jeff and mike squeezed their hand their hand brakes to slow down when they reached the fence jeff dropped to his knees he peered through the hole
bill growled but the dog in the water did not move he didn't drop his meat either
make him come back through this ho the this hole the woman laughed here it be easier for puddles puddles if i open the gate
puddles
fun station was off limits until it opens next summer
puddles was nowhere in sight
just then puddles jumped from jeff's arms
at the top of the hill the boys stopped to catch their breath
because meat slipped from
the roller coaster is made of several s several simple machines simple machines have only one or two parts
jeff
well gravity is a force a force pushes or pulls things explained lisa
yeah jeff nodded gravity is why we
do i push next now
than go to go straight up explained lisa then mike had an idea our bikes go up hill
jeff looked down at the fun station fence
lisa nodded your bike your bike is made of several simple machines the pedals help you turn the wheels the pedals are part of a simple machine called the wheel and axle
jeff watched as mike's as mike's chain slipped over a larger gear
coasted so fast down the hill the hill on our bikes that's right lisa replied your bicycle and the roller coaster both use gravity
jeff looked up the
you're very welcome she said come back this summer and let me know
wow it's huge said mike
there he said to his friend mike now try it
the greedy dog illustrated by kim kelley
paid off jeff wondered how fast they were going
uh
jeff caught the puppy and cl and clipped on his leash i guess puddles thinks it's time to go home laughed jeff
hey he has a bigger piece of meat than i do he he said i want
i don't know it's just got something to do do with the gears answered jeff
the boys jumped on their bikes and headed
that's just another name for a ramp
mom he cried there goes puddles can we go after hi him on our bikes
when an engine turns the gears the chain pulls the cars up the h first it first hill the first hill is always the highest one
by themselves
now do i
that would be tough said jeff it is much easier for roller coaster to climb a ramp then
need to big gears to climb climb up and strong legs too added mike
change your gears mike yelled jeff
cross a stream of
bill stared very hard at the dog in the water bill thought if that if he c that if he could scare him that the other dog would drop his meat
pulled at his leash while the boys thanked thanked lisa
in a few minutes puddles was in jeff's arms jeff hugged him hard puddles wiggled to get free but jeff wasn't about to let him escape again
what's the great gravity machine asked jeff a that's the name of the roller coaster lisa pointed toward the big steel steel hills
jeff gripped the chain with one quick push off the pedal the chain wrapped around the gear
the boys coasted down the hill all their uphill pedaling paid
jeff
puddles pud puddles mike and jeff shouted but puddles did not return then over the sounds of the workers they heard a familiar bark
his mouth and sank to the bottom of the stream the dog in the water lost his meat at the same time and poor bill went home hungry
mike was puzzled jeff why did shifting make it easier to pedal
he stopped suddenly and looked down into the water and another dog looking back at him from inside the stream
one simple machine is an inclined plane
gee thanks he said it's like a brand new bike jeff grinned he liked fixing things then he looked up just in time to see his new puppy running up the hill
on a roller coaster the cars wraps are attached to a chain that wraps around gears
go up hill are they machines
there was puddles digging under the gate oh no he groaned mom said that
as the boys turned home mike thought about his homework i know what i'm going to do for the science fair he announced i'm going to figure out how the gears work on my bike jeff smiled he planned to b to build a roller coaster for his car collection he'd call it the little gravity machine
the hand brakes are simple machines called levers how about the gears asked mike you're right gears are also simple machines answered lisa
bill barked at the dog in the water he was he was sorry for that
but there there is one big difference your bike has pedals the roll coaster cars have no pedals and no engine
how you like the roller coaster ride
woman thank you for bringing puddles out no th no problem said the young woman my name's lisa i'm one of the engineers building the great gravity machine i was playing with puddles when i heard you you call
i can see why they call it great but why about but what about gravity
mike rode the bicycle down the driveway and circled back toward jeff
what a great time i'll have
and he imagined how fast they could go on the roller coaster
jeff
from the other side of the fence a woman spoke have you lost your dog yes cried jeff do you have puddles well said the woman i don't know if it's if it's puddles but i have a friendly little cocker spaniel here that's puddles cried jeff can you
i'm just glad he wo that we won't need to pedal so hard going down the hill
i want that piece and i am and i'm going to get it
the boys looked down the hill below they could see the roller coaster in the new amusement park
up the hill they saw puddles up ahead
a ramp is a machine asked mike
jeff's mom looked out the window yes but come home in time to do your homework remember you must turn
when cars reach the top the force of gravity pulls them down the hill
his owner came
the one at the bottom
him one day race
so he turned
mmm
didn't know it
the way
run away
in with
and how long is that
race

uhm i
rascal raced
come
enjoyed playing at the dog park
that limp
most dogs racer
that
saying
the surgery he didn't ever
one dog at the park named
f
he wanted to do was run and run so he his owners named him rascal
surgery to fix his legs
near where
every time he ran he would
he was there
in
away
on
he
pick on you
end of what

to go away
what's that word
but soon he
he could never catch
while you let me live in your warm branches
said the bird
the pine tree kept the wind off his house
oh willow tree said the little bird will you let me live in your warm branches until the springtime comes no said the wi willow tree i never talk to strangers go away
berries the are very good for little birds
that night the n the north wind came to the woods to play he blew at the leaves with the his icy breath and very
jumper
it one day a long long time ago it was very cold winter
the trees which were kind to the the bird with the broken wing may keep their leaves
tree saw
may i
oh big oak tree
leaves through the winter go away
the pine tree stood beside the spruce when he saw the little bird hopping and fluttering with his broken wing he said
i will not talk to strangers said the pillow
broken wing this
he looked all around to see if there was any place where he could keep warm he saw all the trees of the big forest
oh my said the
said the spruce
jump
have done so very nice
he wanted to touch every leaf in the forest he loved to see the trees bare
the little bi bird hopped and fluttered with his broken wing until he came to the next tree
branch i
i would take care of the strange bird
the were
the poor little bird did not wa know where to go but he hopped and fluttered along
ok but one little bird had a broken wing and couldn't not fly he did
she said all the wood give the little bird
leaf he said to his father and the f
what a thing to ask said the oak tree if you stay in in my branches all winter you will be eating my acorns go away
very warm
would s
tree saw him
the first tree he came to was a silver branch
the trees will not let me live with them and the wing is broken i cannot fly you may live in on one of my branches
until he until springtime springtime comes
then he
kept their leaves through all the winter and they
the little bird was very happy in his warm nest away from the wind with his jumper berries to eat
leave he t touched and felt the ground
the trees at the edge of the forest talked to each other
was coming and all the birds flew away to all warm south
should i read all
so north wind had to leave them alone the spruce the pine and jumper tree
what the pine spruce were doing
may i every
will you let me live in your warm branches until the spring time comes
my branches are not
and i the trees
maybe the trees will keep me warm through the winter he said so he went to the forest hopping and fluttering with his broken wing
h here is the warmest one of all but
per
may
it was a great big oak tree
may i stay all winter yes said the spruce i will have you
what a thing to ask i have to take care of my own
bird i would risk may acorn said the oak
they would wait for the spring
not know what to do
his way
for dinner for the winter but the branches
forest king no said the f forest king
so the little bird fluttered up into the warm branch of his spruce
so the little bird hopped and fluttered with his broken wing until he came to the willow tree by the edge of the brook
but i can keep the wind off because i am big and strong
st would stood very tall and proud
uhm beautiful branch tree he said
and said where d where are you going little bird i don't i do not know said the little bird
i'm going to pick
just then fang bit him
vet because the people in
he didn't enjoy he didn't enjoy playing at the dog park because he didn't have to be on his leash when
fang was laughing because he knew
liked the vet
he thought he thought oh boy i'm going to lick my legs so hard that
then he and ran
bit
it
lick his legs
wear the collar but
fang but he could never catch him
because he like most dogs racer
vet to have
one dog at the park named fang
off
racer said bark bark which in dog talk means don't pick on me any more fang
his legs but
mean old fang said bark bark bark which meant why do you have have to wear that stupid looking collar
racer had to be one
to lick them
pick you on you
but
costume gave him treats racer didn't know it but he was
so he could run as much as
he knew it he
big kisses for fixing his legs
itching is going to go away
and ran away racer's owners said go run so racer started running and chasing fang
dog park racer racer and
his legs didn't itch
vet
dogs racer loved to run
oh surgery
which in in dog talk means you're
where he was but soon he his owners came and drove him home
legs racer was too happy that he could run fast fast and
needed to
he was wearing a
does look silly
there was a dog in the park near
he still needed the
all he wanted to do was run and run so his owners named him racer then he got he then
and go to the dog park but he still had to be on a leash
you
every time he ran he would limp
in white
a when he was three
racer could never catch him but suddenly he noticed that racer was catching up to him racer was running faster than he could ever remember and before
and gave them
bit him on the back leg
fast and that he and ran in circles finally he ran back to his owners
the
but
a few days later he w he went with his owners to the dog
by then his
one day racer went to the
most
sugar to fix his legs
he would always come up to racer and bite his back legs and run away saying bark bark bark
and from that day fang never bit racer's leg
when he woke up from the s surgery he didn't even remember
in his way
his legs but there was a big white thing
sure sure
when his when his owners got him as a puppy
on a leash sink since he
for six weeks racer would take walks
racer would always chase
but that didn't stop him from running because
the
he liked there was one dog at at
he had caught up to fang and knocked him down
the end
so he turned to his head around the lick
to see the to see all his friends
to
so he didn't want to
vet treats are
y you are too slow to catch me with
and
on on the drive home racer real realized that his legs itched very badly
heal from from his surgery but
collar that made it impossible to
eventually racer didn't have to
even even even
where he lived
then he got older he
one day he took a walk through through the dog park and his friends were there as usual then his owners reached out around his neck and took off his leash

began to dig
crashing
i went walking what did you
i went walking what did i see
where are you crying s
i saw a lot of animals following me
i saw a brown horse looking at me
pink pig looking at me

why do you put bubbles in the fish tanks asked tom
called tom
like you said mr chu
sh
maybe said mr chu
the
now next
p
and
their names are
they
the water through
they swam
with
chu
and water
the man at the pet store
but something was wrong they
are
uhm
are some small
don't forget to feed
tom looked at the bubbles in the fish tanks
it is clean
pushes
black
my name is tom
tom said
it traps the dirt in
than they do now
fish need to breath air just like people do
why are
in the water
i put just a little food on
into their tanks
the bigger it gets
tell me about your goldfish said
glad to meet you tom
to the pet store maybe someone there can tell
his mother
if you don't use a pump you must change the water twice a week said mr chu
m
pet store
of air in the water
he took very good care of them
what
it sounds like you are feeding them
up to me to take care of them
over
were also
waved goodbye to tom
ok
s
find out what is wrong with your pets
were also
thank you mr chu said tom
answered mr chu
and swim
air
lot
but he couldn't stop thinking about the bubbles
what
collects
put
chu
well
but i
i don't know
a bubble holds
tom and mr chu walked
the gold one
i haven't changed it said tom
his fish
look at the
tom would never forget
an air pump he said
he called
i want my fish to be health happy and healthy
traps the dirt
we
do you feed your fish tom
bubbles big
them for his birthday he loved to watch
water comes
do i need to read out loud
how does the water get clean asked tom
of the water
i have two
those bubbles are
when i
chu
asked mr
can i help
she
said
they'll start to feel better
melvin
gold
that why my
he had gotten
it is good that you take care of your
filled with bubbles
are lucky to have
chu
it looks like the fish are taking a bubble bath
as he
that might help us
how often do you change the water
was full of all kinds of fish they

cassie
about
she looked carefully at at the globe
the rid riddles of aunt red wing
be winter

than it does in the summer
ca
it's some animal
the second clue is
but when i hold the lamp
she said
if it
what
the equator she asked
aunt red wing is in a place where the noon shadows
to do with the seasons
certainly can said matt
at the angle like the noon sun
where is it cold in the
red wing matt laughed
sun
cassie looked on the floor i see a short
i wonder how the length of shadows can tell where
month of june
cassie looked at the postcard it had no
as he as she walked the library
postcards for cassie in mother's letters
that's right
aunt red wing is right again said matt
cassie turned the postcard over
cassie thought for a moment
australia has koala bears and
cassie
don't they don't they
maybe she she's somewhere in africa
on matt's desk
he worked after school
but i don't
by the length of shadows
the sun
look what i have
is short
when when i hold the lamp
this postcard
read
cassie looked at
ever since aunt red wing had begun to travel
where aunt red wing is
when the light shines from above the shadow
tells us it's winter
it's
sun sets
the shadow grows longer
that's right
equator
that's right said matt
long said cassie
pretend
a lamp on his desk
sets much earlier
in the winter
yes i do
what's next what's the next

i think i'll ask matt
but she
or stamp

the sun
and long winter shadows at noon
and summer in january
and her riddles laughed

matt nodded
globe
i at but i don't
was in high school
it was from aunt red
you can tell the seasons
hi said cassie
noon shadows are long
where she sh where she was
what do you see
so do i read who it's by
aunt red wing an aunt red wing
said matt
where aunt red wing is
i didn't look too
so that also
at this angle
that the sun
we were so busy trying to guess the riddle that we never even looked at the picture
but i don't see what it is ha
if it is if it is winter in june then aunt red wing must be somewhere south of the
is the picture on the card
pointing to a line around the middle of the globe
let's
are
is
he reached for
is high
what it what
that means you have another riddle to figure out
i see a short shadow
aunt red wing is
postmark
she had some ideas
ca ca library cassie read
aunt red wing took people on trips all over the world
said matt
she laughed a koala bear
i know
and winter in june
that's true said matt
said cassie maybe there's another clue said matt
isn't this
see what it has to do
at the public library
when i hold the lamp
you can you
during the summer the moon
sets soon
other postcard from aunt
like this
cassie studied the riddle
at
cassie liked to visit him there
she had put
cassie was proud of herself
i didn't look too closely
here
that's right said matt
soon
said cassie
cassie thought
well said cassie
that lamp
since the noon sun is low in winter it must
the shadows are long
look at the floor
in the winter
and shadows are shorter
cassie said
clue
said
cassie thought
because it had come in a letter
shadows are the first clue
wanted to ask matt
when cassie came to his desk
over

matter has three forms solid liquid and gas
a rock and broke off a piece of ice she dropped the ice into a plastic bag now i need
and the robot filled it that's liquid water she said
define matter the robot computer buzzed and blinked
ms wong laughed it's ok maya
matter
as she flew
liquid in water
what about the third form asked ms wong
two hours to solve your problems maya opened her map of
she was wondering what
asked maya in surprise yes you did answered ms wong maya ran happily into the spaceship
the jar here is liquid water then she took out a plastic bag here is steam the gas
to fill a plastic bag with steam the bag filled like a balloon maya sealed the mouth of the bag
screen flashed it matter can be a solid a liquid or a gas what is water is matter maya thought it must have three forms too i must find water as a solid liquid and a gas i know where there's
matter
she looked at the map again but both slimy swamp and steaming springs looked like good places to find water steaming springs was closer
maya arrived at the frozen mountains and landed at the bottom of the an ice cliff
when you heat or cool matter it can change form heat melted the solid ice the steam cooled and became liquid you mean
i know that
each year they got a different problem
maya landed in steaming springs she spoke to her robot once again question what is steam the ro robot buzzed steam is a gas it is water in a gas form steam is the third form of water
three forms of water what water is matter can matter have more than one form again maya spoke to her robot
she looked
the other plastic
maya walked slowly from the spaceship and took a deep breath
would be
then she turned out
and here is steam the gas maya was shocked
you must find three forms of water
oh maya i was worried about you did you solve your problem yes ms wong replied maya
water is
to find the third form of water she thought what can it be
now i need t the two other forms maya checked the map and flew toward the frozen mountains
words appeared on its screen matter anything that takes up space and has mass well maya thought
you you've learned something else about matter
maya thought about her problem i must find
she flew to the lake of tears and landed on its shore
maya didn't know what to say
at it opened looked at it she circled the places that she thought might have water
next year's problem
the gas maya w
now back to the ship she cried when maya got back to the ship ms wong was outside waiting for her she smiled
maya opened her envelope and read her problem
i found three forms of water to solve my problem
the plastic bag didn't look like a balloon anymore it held only a few drops of water
i'll go there first maya decided she turned on the jet pack and flew off to the springs time was running out
maya heard her teacher ms wong her voice came from a loudspeaker on the spaceship get started
she shut off her jet pack and p spoke to her robot question what is ice the robot blinked ice solid it is frozen water
maya opened her pack she pulled out
i passed
water takes up space and has mass so water must be matter
i've found it maya told the robot fill
they had to solve the problem to enter the next grade
she took a jar from her pack and from
bag held only liquid water too what happened she cried i really did find three different forms of water now i have only one
hmmm maya said she spoke to her robot computer
on her jet pack waved at the spaceship and flew off
it was easy really the teacher asked yes maya said i learned that
hint use what you know about matter

stratus clouds she said no no balloon ride today
company would you like to go up again oh yes said ruth what a good day it had been
ruth found doc by her garage she heat she was looking at her big thermometer ruth knew that the
doc is home ruth said jumping to her feet
ruth laughed how can the clouds tell us anything doc pointed to a fluffy white clouds in the sky

she could hardly wait for a clear blue sky
it it is a thick low cloud that covers the sky fog is stratus cloud near the ground what are clouds made of asked ruth clouds are made of tiny drops of water or bits of ice doc explained i have an idea she suddenly sh

the balloon looked like a big pumpkin to ruth it's a pump
blown across the sky in a big balloon
then to heat the
that monday ruth
ruth's school i floated it floated above mr hill's flag
she thought about being
or some cumulus clouds without any wind then it would be time for another ride in the pumpkin balloon
sure doc replied i like having company
doc high toward the clouds ruth
a door slammed
ruth laughed
ruth asked parents ruth asked parents if she could
it wasn't wasn't balloon weather after all
now ruth would watch the sky every day
a third kind of cloud to look for is stratus the doc said doc
to the park her friends always helped to fill the balloon with air
i it got bigger and bigger
might change it in about a day so cumulus clouds mean it's nice out and cirrus clouds mean
okay
on wednesday the sun was shining ruth dressed in a r in a rush and ran to find doc she opened the back door she saw mr hill's flag flapping in the wind
okay yes
thermometer measures
doctor bell lived next door doc liked to ride in balloons doc took
early thursday morning ruth called doc there's no rain or wind the weather is just right there are only a few cumulus clouds in the sky you're right ruth said doc let's go
those are cumulus clouds they tell us the fair weather is here
and they said yes she couldn't wait next morning ruth saw fog the sky was filled with thick low clouds
see said suddenly you watch the clouds this week when the weather is right we'll go for a balloon ride
i can see why
is it a pumpkin balloon and she shouted doc helped her climb into the basket doc's friends
air so the balloons would rise doc would climb into a large basket tied to the balloon
ruth
it was so nice to be up high but in less than an hour the wind began to blow we'd better land now said doc ruth didn't mind she'd had a great time soon the pumpkin balloon was back on the ground

grandpa shook his head
i was playing with puddles when i heard you call
the boys jumped on their bikes and headed up the hill
jeff's mom l looked out the window
mike rode his bicycle down the driveway
do you work
on a roller coaster the cars are attached to the chain
cried jeff
that helps
huh that doesn't make sense at all oh well
the boys coasted down the hill
one simple simple machine
puddles was
i know what i'm going to do for a science fair for the science fair he announced i'm going to figure out how gears work on my bike
jeff why di
and strong legs too
gravity is why
but jeff wasn't about to let him escape again
then mike had an idea
no how
jeff caught the puppy and clapped
jeff watched as mike
jeff and mike squeeze squeezed their
is a ramp a machine asked mike
yes
steel hi hills
t
well gravity is a force
the pedals help you turn the wheels the pedals are part of a simple machine called
but there is one big difference your b bikes have pedals
please tell me you work
she said come back in the summer
that makes pedaling much easier
when the cars reach the top the force of gravity pulls them them down the hill
the park was called fun s
was
gears are also simple machines
on the pedals as they climbed up the steep hill
that's the name of the roller coaster
i'm glad that that we won't need to pedal so so hard going down the hill
in your ideas for
i liked f
park
here here it will be easier for puddles if i open the gate
that would be tough said jeff
they
incline
but puddles did not return
the little gravity machine
until it opens next summer
and the roller coaster both use gravity
i'm one of the engineers building
now here
he peered through the hole
a machine
if i didn't know
said mike i can see why they call it great
see where was i
asked mike
his golden ears flopped up and down
what's the great
i don't know it's got something to do
remember you must
i like this brand new bike
can you make him come back through his hole
at the roller coaster at the new
when the
how b how about the gears
suppose that you have had to climb straight up
uphill pedaling
an
shifting make it easier to pedal
he planned to build a roller coaster for his car collection
in sight
no problem said the young woman
there was puddles digging under the gate oh no
that's right
i guess puddle thinks it's time to go home laughed jeff
ok that's hard
when they reached the fence jeff dropped to his knees
a mansion
huh
it's huge
do you have puddles
mom he cried there goes puddles
jeff gripped the chain with one quick push of the pedal and the chain wrapped around the gear there he said to his friend mike
cocker spaniel here
or pulls things
i wonder if you work
and axle
or
the roller coaster is made of several simple machines
that as that doesn't
you like the roller coaster ride
to catch their breath
uhm
next hill by themselves
look at that those hills mike
just then puddles jumped from jeff's arms
change your gears mike
was what
is an inclined plane
they could
toward the big
the roller coaster at the new
have you lost your dog
then he looked up just in time to see ha his new puppy running up the hill
in a few minutes puddles
than to go straight
and he imagined how fast they could gain
gravity mansion
is anything
puddles but i have a little
the
they saw puddles up ahead
there's more
yes but come home in time to do your homework
and circled back towards jeff gee thanks he said
the hand brakes are simple machines called levers
you do things more easily
great
that wraps around the gears
can you m can
why did
j jeff smiles
no here
all their
is
a as mike's chain slipped
on his leash
our bikes go up the hill are they machines
in s
added mike jeff looked down at the fun station fence
we coasted so fast down the hill on our bikes
jeff looked looked up at the woman thank you for bringing puddles out
wow
yes cried jeff
hand brakes slow down
sure a are said lisa
should i start reading here or here
the wheel
a force pushes
and let me know how
at the top of the hill the boys stopped
great
the coaster cars have no pedals and no engine
coasted down coasted
answered the li lisa
as they climbed the steep hill
was
when when they reach the bottom the cars are going fast enough to get the
station
lisa pointed
the boys looked down the hill below they could see
a familiar bark from the other s side of the fence a woman spoke
inclined
for your science project tomorrow
f he liked fixing things
a ramp
a few minute
then over the sounds of the workers they heard
they were go going
plane inclined
the boys
the great
it's
is
your bike is made of several of several simple machines
but what about gravity
you're very welcome
thanks jeff
puddles was
you're right
as he ran over the hilltop the boys pushed harder
the first hill is always the highest one
gravity mansion asked jeff
to do with with the gears answered jeff
turn
jeff grinned
from the ground to the top of the roller coaster hill
the woman laughed
oh well i'll just skip it
engine turns the gears the chain pulls the top of the cars up the first hill
he'd call it
jeff wondered h how fast
incline
no
puddles pulled at his leash while the boys thanked lisa
my name is lisa
he groaned mom said that fun station was off limits
lisa replied your bicycle
well said the woman
great
dropped to his knees
is anything that helps
can we go a after him on our n on our bikes
now try it
that help
axle
that's puddles
explained lisa
hello
ok ok just try and get
as the boys turned toward home mike thought about his homework
mike was puzzled
simple machines have only two one or two parts
all
explained lisa up
was
jeff
yelled jeff
puddles wiggled to get free
yeah jeff nodded
i'll bet we we would need some big gears to climb them
yes
st
and s
that's just another name for a ramp
go on the roller coaster
a ramp than to go straight up
when it was in jeff's arms jeff hugged him hard
i was
just a little practice how were you in the cage said what pos position were you in
when i fe
if you really want my op opinion clear what sort of was it
finally the tiger walked on with him after a time the he met a little jackal coming happily down the road oh brother jackal said
a and took only two
little slow
now let me see it
the mouth of the jar was too small for
and throw stones at my branches for more fruit men are
by the road a banyan tree is a kind of fruit tree brother banyan
they saw an eagle flying
agreed to wait
the brahmin tree looked
at me with arrows men are cruel
to serve i serve him well he carried heavy loads and carried them far
to wait
the tiger jumped on brahmin brahmin spoke the ti the tiger jumped the brahmin spoke
but brahmin but brother tiger said brahmin you know what if you i let you out you would jump on me and eat me caught never brother brahmin said the tiger never in the world such
the moment
ok this
i know i am very slow but i can understand thing unless i see just were
oh does it really said the little jackal does it really well brother brahmin now
will not let me have a handful of nuts
but every time a man see me they throws stones at me and
it makes it it so much clearer but i still don't get quite understand it
i don't think
i said
instead
stood
is four the tiger to eat me after i set him from his cage
grunted and snorted
a glass full and n uh
when the the sun is hot men come to sit
if he decided it was right the brahmin would let the tiger eat him the first thing
the tiger grumbled the
not fair for you to eat me when i set you free
the villagers had caught him and
ear earlier
they came to a place where a
thin clear voice i live high in the air he said
it shuts like this said the brahmin pushing the it shut yes yes i don't
at la at last tiger tried to eat brahmin at once the poor br brahmin had to remind him again
his mother laughed when she saw the cause of trouble you greedy boy
know what is it the what is this way good bye
the me the spot
as you
y i said yelled the brahmin i think it
and i saw a tiger oh dear s oh dear said the jackal i'll never understand
a way to fix it instead of screaming said his mother and
here i stood here in the roadside said the brahmin and tiger where were you said the little jackal i was in the cage of course roared the tiger
on my shoulder like this
the brahmin
said the brahmin that gives me no idea at all said the little jackal listen my friends
lau when he got into trouble again he stopped to think
give us a pos
now what is that now what was it
jackal
he pulled and pulled and became very angry at the jar but it w it was no use his hand was stuck
at them and spoke in a tired voice
wants to eat me after i let him out of a cage
no matter what the tiger would have won right
cause after all the three
in the summer he said
the first five people they met
do just let me out for a minute and i'll get a little little drink of water
oh but this is only the second brother tiger
but brother tiger said brahmin you promised you would not
one day a brahmin was walking on a country road
we've only asked one
if
us if it seems fair for this tiger should eat me
the door works i am sure could understand
good bye brother he said
i think you should
yes yes said the brahmin
you don't know what a brahmin brahmin is brahmin is
yeah i sort of agree with him
you set him free you s
at last he began to scream and cry his mother ran into the room he saw what was wrong wrong with him was matter albert she asked
a glass full nuts was on the table albert who loved nuts saw it he climbed up on the table and put his hand into the jar he grabbed a whole handful
the mud all day as harmless and harm n less as a bird
of my shade and eat my fruit on my branches but when the evening comes
an old brahmin tree
i mean but at last we he went again with the brahmin on again
i and i will you up said the tiger but brahmin argued
oh brother brahmin brother brahmin said the tiger please let me out and get a little drink s
the brahmin went to him and said brother bull oh brother bull it does seem a
right that this tiger could eat me i set
they stone
i mean i in my slow mind but i cannot come out by yourself
does it lock on the outside
try taking out a few at a time
and wait until we see the fifth he begged
you may i ask
show me the cage so brahmin the tiger and the little jackal walked together
to the tiger i think you will be a good while before
greedy
the
that
said the little jackal i really am so silly
i stood here said the tiger as he jumped out into the cage with my head
set i set him free from his cage cage said the little jackal yes yes cage said
why a big plain cage an iron one
you'll find any one who let's you out again
his hand came out easily
brahmin
i am
if i get it this said the little jackal
ungrateful let the tiger eat the brahmin
for his fist
in the sky the brahmin called up to him oh brother eagle
said the brahmin said the bu
the tiger jumped on brahmin to eat him up the time the brahmin had to work very hard to keep him off at last the tiger stopped and walked on together a little while they saw an alligator he was lying at the side of a river's edge brother alligator said the brahmin does it seem right for that tiger
let the tiger eat brahmin
at
not that i am old and weak i can not work he leaves me without no food or water
i would do such bad things
very quickly
they would ask
was he was out he jumped on brahmin and about to eat him up
brother eagle tell
brahmin
and could you show me the door
then he bowed to brahmin
that you looked sh
s cried albert
poke me with sharp sticks man men are worthless let the tiger eat brahmin man ye
please forgive me
i don't think oh said the little jackal
what cage said the jackal why the cage he was in said the brahmin you see but don't understand said the jackal
uh
then he said i lie here
in the cool sh cool
the a good deal at last but
they came to to ask was out
and shut him and there for being wicked
it is perfectly right
and i do not harm any man yet when men find my babies then they
old bull was laying in the road
does it seem right that
don't you don't need a whole handful at once she said
that he had asked only four wait till we have one more
just but i don't see any lock said the little jackal does the lock
slow mind
you want my opinion
then an the then i could understand in a jiffy
next time don't be so
it's fair that
talk like
as for you my friend he s said
well excuse me mister
so oh thank you thank you very much said the little jackal
if you want are going to get to the bottom of this
we want to know what you think
do you think it is fair the tiger eats me after i got him out of this terrible cage excuse me said the little jackal
of a waxed to fix
brahmin where were you
do you think brahmin said i right for tiger i mean it's right for it
the old alligator turned in the mud and
the sun
we pro we pose to ask five
please brother brahmin
whatever it was fair for him to eat the brahmin
that he came upon a tiger shut in a strong iron cage
is
when he i have just saved him from his cage frightful cage the eagle scared soared slowly overhead a moment then he came lower and spoke in a
said the brahmin
we still ha we still have four to ask
at last tiger r
his mother
how does it shut
a to you
it went this way i walked along
let it stay locked
the bull looked up he said a deep grumbling voice when i was young and strong my master used me hard
and there is no water here
a brahmin is a very good and gentle kind man who lives in india
so brahmin unlocked the door and let the tiger out
because of i mean i don't agree with him if someone's bad to them they should be nice to them anyway right
oh i am sorry said the little jackal i know
the this mean old jar
b but man but i hunt no man
he tried to pull out his hand uh i mean his hand out
and they rest they break my twigs and scatter my leaves
and after a time
banyan tree
i am so thirsty
so hard at the at last the tiger to
my young and rob my nest and shoot
to to fair thing that this tiger should eat me after i freed him from his cage
when i set from his ca set him from the cage
oh
albert took
can't you see that the door shut me in said the tiger
it locks like this and the
me to speak a little more loudly and a little more c clear i am a
to the spot of the cage w
do do you think it's fair that the tiger should eat me
with a a long story
you'll finally
i cannot quite understand what happened little what you need to just
s
at the park ruth watched
kind of cloud
what fair weather is here
balloon would
dragon
replied
need the right kind of weather
the pumpkin balloon floated over land
in the
her friends always
let's see what the clouds

on wednesday the sun was shining ruth dressed
fog
they tell me

next morning ruth saw fog
said doc
doc showed ruth pictures of other kinds of clouds
she was looking
doctor bell lived next door
some
circulus clouds that
red
but less than an hour the wind began to go we better land now said doc
doc would climb in a
those clouds are
leaned back in the warm grass
doc liked to ride in balloons
there's a few
a big pumpkin to ruth
clouds near the ground
the back door she saw
ruth asked her parents if she could go
orange balloon fill with air it got bigger and bigger
start
is balloon weather said doc ruth smiled
towards the clouds hi
doc is home
oh yes said ruth what a good day it has been now ruth could watch the sky every day she could hardly wait
so
as the air
it floated above mister hills flag it was so nice to be up high b
balloon with air
ruth laughed how can the clouds tell us anything doc pointed to f fluffy
she opened
there's no rain no wind
the balloon looked like a
water and bits of ice doc explained i
i can't
stars
it's a thick low cloud
high in the sky are thin and white
big thermometer ruth knew that the thermometer
then
ch
tube falls
soon the big pumpkin balloon was back on the ground thank you very much
they
the
she could see
measures the temperature of the air
big balloon to
in the sky
doc's friends untied the ropes slowly the balloon rose
doors
the big
we'll go up for a balloon ride
is for
lift doc
fair weather
like having company would you like to go up again
suddenly a door slammed
gas tube rises
it floated above ruth's school
weather might change in about a day
tell us about the weather
helped to fill the
when the weather's right
it wasn't a balloon after all
in a rush and ran to find doc

he looked at lou lois
on saturday morning
to or el or else bad things will happen look john i've
he was an excellent dentist but his real love was music
flies anymore they had to cover their ears from the horrible sound
they couldn't keep john in jail since was were breaking any laws
played flute doesn't sound all that bad but just try to imagine someone scratching a chalkboard with a fork
flute the flies were annoying flies would swat his flute
you should know a little about
john the dentist is driving the flies away
they couldn't keep john in jail and they
the people in
and let him play down where no one could hear him
before they knew it the town was filled with flies
oh that's a nice instrument but
was shaped made his flute sound awful we can't he we can't let you play the flute anymore john
the local dentist dr
they couldn't swat them off it was gross then suddenly the flies
the town dentist everybody's teeth were much whiter and cleaner and no one had any cavities so the there w was a problem in
and guess what it worked
but it was very upset at first then he said oh well good thing i brought my old flute as back up
thankfully someone was digging a hole and found water
that didn't work
than thousands of flies crawling on them
player was rooster john he wasn't called rooster john yet
they were the were up on the main float a big band played as they marched up and down main street
said the police chief s said police chief sanders the neighbors are complaining and the cats and dogs are trying to chew off their ears
said chief sanders
however for some reason
windows were breaking
the people as
flute sounded when this guy played it i'm serious still it's not as bad as millions of flies i suppose
so there was noth so there was nothing
at them with his hand or even his new flute
franksville was a town that seemed to have one problem after the other
nice teeth so they so they
it to take
to celebrate the fact for once there there was no water problem no fly problem and no flute problem
franksville
but an echo in the well the flute sound louder
he thought if that he made a new mouthpiece
dr wong thought for a second then pronounced
out john could play it quite well
what
wong but it was too late john had started playing swat at the townsfolk
then the flies stopped
a fly landed on a little girl then a fly landed on someone else then some landed on a bunch of people pretty soon tons of flies tons of flies
looked really silly at the dances dancing to music they couldn't hear they just couldn't lead a normal life
john no
rooster john before i tell you about rooster john
like a rooster and play to keep the flies away
sound so much that he threw john in jail
he was the
i have to
heard you play the clarinet you're quite good why don't you play that instead
he played many musical instruments such as guitar the tuba the piano and the clarinet
so of
the flies would land all over
up
because they all had such
and it was then that the people of franksville real realized that they would have to
play the flute normally
town decided to have a great big parade in franksville
didn't want to kick out of out of town
oh no cry cry chief sanders just when things were were going good for
john thought that was an ok idea but
it's just not the flute i even wrote you a song chief sanders it's called cops and robbers then he played the song
wong came up with an idea
dr wong was the town hero the flute sounded normal and it turned
in the little town of of frankville of of franksville
flew away fast as they could
soon after that started to get the flies they got tons and tons of flies
no no please don't play your old flute begged dr
then suddenly
no one could hear anything people were getting into car accidents and everybody
from then on john would wake up at sunrise
the police chief hated the so
everyone cheered
that came later
but i have to play i was born to do it i don't know why but i feel like
oh
the way his mouth was
and all the cows in town started to make sour milk
the police could do besides everybody loved john since he had become
it into
their problems started out when they ran out of water
he started shaking the flute to get the flies off and accidentally smashed pieces
decided that john could play the flute and everybody else would have to wear earplugs well i'm sure you guessed that
the good with the bad because as bad as the flute sounded it was a lot bad better
the bad flute
dr wong and john were the stars of the parade
es especially shaped for john's mouth
what should they do the
the
it's the flute sound the flies hate john's flute playing as much as we do
but just then a man moved into town who played the flute so badly that people would run stopped run away screaming this maybe
then he said
so they decided to lower him down a well
were landing on everyone
a poorly
when the townsfolk heard the noise they couldn't even swat
got his name i should tell
what to do so he just kept on pieces
was the new town dentist

each leaf had a
planet
pete liked the

pines
pete explained the
s pete started into the pin forests
inside of seeds
asked his father
the
where
that is a con

on his father's leg
he suddenly it
in the water to make tea
cones
he saw a bush with some
look carefully
ly then
end

bon
he hurried off into the woods
pete

i'll
their were
white flowers too
one la
you're right his father
pete's father was
pete had never seen anything so pretty
pete
or
or plant pet
aided
cone bearing plants have seeds inside cones
his father always reminded pete that
toy trees
scratch
do you know what
mountains the land didn't seem as beautiful now as he had
s
the right plant his father
one kind m has flowers groups of three
soon the jar was full of spores
want you to take me
most plants do
pete's father had told
s
well
good said his father
pete father drank the tea
he told him about the strange plant with
have flowers with groups of three petals
he must find
if you can
opposite each other on the
i think my leg is infected
finding pine snap was easy too
but
at all those
willows were long skinny leaves
bark
amos you crazy mule pete yelled at
bear father would have
plants don't have flowers pete had
across from it
bones
pete had shiny green leaves some leaves that were turning red
but healing
is that the word
actually
or
that's a fine idea
like
georgia
to the clearing pete's father
like pine cones
he was getting
then i won't
shook the plant
he was lying on the ground with his broken leg wrapped in cloth
you can name it
plant
he thought ba
that wh the white flowers
for hours
s suddenly it close
it set
he went closer to the bush
pete showed his father the plants
of the lesson his father had given him pete felt sad
club moss too
peter
up
on an
father do you
he be sure
he expanded the plant
if was for
and was easy to find
bring me
named for him
the other is cone bearing
and roots
his father smiled
and looked at the roots
the
the pine snap and club moss
boston
he knew better than to touch
put the willow bark
pete
as pete left the cleaning
flower hunter too
than to touch a strange plant
hunting trips
was
looking at him proudly
he had
this
the plant
he picked up a sack
covered his arms
inside them asked his father
what he had learned
to see that plant with his white flowers
hunt for
into a tired voice
it for the friend ben franklin
a good botanist careful
divide
spores had the pine snap were helping infect the leg heal
put
seventeen sixty five
could he find the right
his father said
smell smelled their green needles then
and his father had been
growing by the river
at the grazing animal
earlier trip some
burton right
if you had not run from the
sharp smell
plants plants pete's father
conifer
fat and bumpy the bumpy
in place
from the bark
boston
they looked
of the
they hiked
he screeched every he searched everywhere
like pin cones said pete
then you
he
camp campfire pete's father was hurt
and then
fir on
the root was
plant with
cl
then pete's father slept
th
thing white on it he
after letting the
it reached to camp
club
he one kind
thinking again
cuttings from the plant
he stripped off some bark and put on the
that looked right but how could
fa
the leaves were
campfires
and he
four or five pellets
he likes to have a plant
flowering plant
fruit leaves stems
help me get well
test pete dug up it the plant
had said there are trees
few towns
yes those are the right plants son
father will like this he thought
a
con breaking plant
and
a cup he put them
sly
wanted to be
pete remembered that club moss was notice
added
there
on
pete's father stood
as it had earlier
your cones have
heard his father call
me to
now pete started to
his father's life depends on it
pellets
i think we should name
so i can use the mouse to
they are
him that
pete billowed some water
pete
please hurry pete was afraid
and no doctors on the georgia mountain and
pine trees were
i have a bad fever

plants pete
he thought might be
uhm
for
answered
wouldn't have fallen off there were
and he had a large white flowers
pete's mm
right for p

tiny club moss plants grew under the
pete
peter can you help me make a crutch
plants
pete had his father
pete picked up lump
is that boston
pete
hunting for
of your
were pine
hills mike
ears asked mike
mike rode the bicycle down the driveway
puddles was nowhere in sight puddles puddles
i know you're very welcome come back this summer and i'll let you
the boys jumped
the roller coaster cars have no pedals no engine
him puddles wiggled to get free but he was jeff wasn't about to let him escape again
well gravity is a force a force that pushes
look at those hills
hill
jeff laughed
off limits until it opens next summer the boys coasted down the hill
lisa replied
that's puddles cried jeff can you make him come back through this hole the woman laughed here i bet it's easier if puddles
matt mike thought about his homework i know that i'm going to do for the science fair he announced
what's the great gravity machine asked jeff that's the name for the roller coaster lisa pointed toward the big steel hills wow it's huge
the steep hill change your gears mike yelled jeff he watched as mike's chain slipped over a large gear thanks jeff
with one
i there goes puddles
the first hill is always the highest one when the cars reach the top the force of the gravity pulls it down the hill m and then when they reach the bottom when the cars are going fast enough to get up the next hill by themselves yeah jeff nodded gravity is why we go so fast down the hill on our bikes that's right
some big gears to climb them and strong legs too added mike jeff looked down at the fun station fence puddles was digging under the gate oh no he groaned mom said that the fun station was off limits until
then just then puddles
gee thanks he said
then over the sounds of the workers they heard a family a familiar bark from f from the over other side of the fence a woman spoke have you lost your dog yes cried jeff do you have do you have puddles
and let me know i know how you you like the roller coaster ride
his golden ears flopped up and down as he ran over the hilltop
jeff gripped
one or two parts the simple machine is an
at the first hill
mike had an idea our bikes
i guess
jeff wondered how fast they could go imagine how fast they could go on the roller coaster mike and ike jeff and mike squeezed their hand t brakes to slow down they reached the fence they jeff dropped to his knees he peered through the hole
and the roller coaster both use gravity but there is one big difference
a few minutes
on
call it the great
i'm just glad that we won't need to pedal so hard to get down the hill the boys looked d the hill below they could see the roller coaster in the new amusement park
asked mike
the wheels the pedals are part of a simple machine called the wheel and the axle the hand and brakes are a simple machine called levels levels
he there he said to his
puddles pulled his leash
bet we would need
you're right the gears are simple machines answered lisa
mike and jeff shouted but puddles did not return
and circled back toward jeff
come back this summer and
no problem said the young woman my name's lisa i'm one of the engineers building the great gravity machine i i was playing with puddles when i heard you call
they saw puddles up ahead
jeff looked up at the woman thank you for bringing puddles out
the roller coaster car has several simple machines simple machines have only two or
pulls things explained lisa on the roller coaster cars attach to the chain that wraps around gears then the engine turns the gears and the chains pulls the cars up the hill first them
that would be tough said jack it's much easier for a roller coaster to climb a ramp than go straight up lisa explained
jeff laughed
and then uphill pedaling pad off
les if i open the gate
your bicycle and
said mike can see why they call it the
amp what's a ramp a machine
that makes me pedaling much easier at the top of the hill the boys kept breath mike was puzzled jeff why did shifting make it easier to pedal i don't know it's just when i got something to do with gears answered jeff
lisa nodded your bike is made of several simple machines the pedals help you turn
quick quick push on the pedal with a chain wrapped around the gear
we can go after him on our bikes jeff's mom looked out the window yes yes but come back and do your homework remember you must us turn in your ideas for the science fair project tomorrow
what's a ra
from on jeff caught the puppy and clipped and clipped his leash i guess puddles thinks it's time to go home
oh
well said the woman i don't know if it's puddles but it's a friendly cocker spaniel
it's a brand new bike jeff grinned
as the boys turned home mark
that's the great
the boys pushed harder on the pedals as they climbed
a
he liked the fixing when he just looked up in time to see his new puppy running up the hill mom he cried
the highest one
go up the hill are they machines
and it's puddles w was in jeff's arms jeff hugged
your bike has pedals
but why about gravity
jeff smiled he planned to build a roller coaster of it's collection you would call it the little little gravity machine
sure said lisa a machine is anything that helps you do things more easily suppose that you had to climb up the hill straight and then the ground top that roller coaster coasts
the park was called the fun station
how about the gears
to his friend mike now try it
leash while the boys thanked lisa
the boys jumped on their bikes and headed up to the hill
there had once been a papa mouse as well but he died while he was hunting for food one night he saw a nice piece of cheese in a box and tried to get it when he stuck his head into the box it closed with a snap
after tonight we will not be hungry for a long time
almost morning mamma mouse decided to leave the attack on the flour barrel for the next night she took a few crumbs that were on the floor
mamma mouse
she doesn't have to know said the bad dock
i wished i could not i could go with mother some night said dock
if he could only get to it
if we only look for them but they couldn't couldn't find
all of the house very carefully
d and ran down the
there is a corner lay almost half of a muffin
that lived in the house
she only said you see my dears your mother in knew best
the lustre the dies
after all remember what happened to your poor father
the lamps now glitter down the street faintly sound the falling feet
and he stuck his head in dock could hear the ticking louder
if they were found they would have to run for their lives
better than the kitchen said dock
he could only
it was a one o'clock
do said dickory well said hickory i'd like to take a little stroll
is it alive asked dock i don't know said hickory again
where i will not be found
they
we are enough now said dock and if i knew
think they know
and ticked out the minutes in a loud and strong voice
how mean people are to put things where a hungry mouse cannot
be good children said mamma mouse the next
their their little hearts beat very fast because they knew
between the kitchen and the wall
in summer
mamma mouse was sad to be all alone she felt that people were mean to kill a poor mouse because he wanted to get food for himself and his family
to his
of the clock until he came to the gears
what is it asked dickory
back in the morning
at the back of the flour barrel
eaten they they all curled up with their mother and slept all day
leave the nest
we are big enough
dock ran up the sides
at last mamma mouse chewed a hole through the board
to the clock
there was a big wall for hats and coats a bucket of umbrellas two very pretty chairs and a best of all a tall clock
go
find for the three mice
so he went through the crack and his two
mice can't the earn money like people do to do
hickory dickory dock inside the hollow wall of a house way up near the roof for lived a family of mice it was a snug little home he was nice and quiet and a and as dark as any mouse could ever want mamma mouse liked it
he thought it it must be good
so
and i bet there
just beside dock's ear
but you must promise to be very careful and not get into any trouble i'll take you through the hole that i found so the three little mice started off with the hickory showing the way soon they came to a crack in the wall hickory stuck his head through
but
not listening to her so she did not
now in the falling of the gloom the red fire paints the empty room and warmly on the roof it looks and flickers on the back of the books armies march by tower and spire
the next time you run away
what it looks like
mouse with a sigh but just then she saw a barrel of flour on the flour that made her happy she knew she could easily chew through that and that could eat the flour instead of bread it was not
she was getting ready ready for her journey to the kitchen
i know a way out said hickory but mamma wouldn't like it if we
were left alone hickory wanted to go to sleep again but
at night they there are no people around to bug them
glow t returns again the phantom city burns and down the red the red hot valley lo the phantom armies marching go
to keep
he found nothing except a hole
when mamma mouse came down to look for him he was dead
came
i will chew a hole at the
for her children and ran back into the wall up to her nest hickory and dickory and dock were very glad to get the crumbs because they were hungry when they had
you not
it's no fun to stay here all the time she will take us when
more all the doors in the hall were closed dock went and
they were surprised by what they saw
without saying anything to his brothers
clock as fast as he could
the little girl of the family had it was a great
was fast asleep
when she told
but hickory and dickory and dock did not run away again
hickory dickory dock the mouse ran up the clock the clock struck one the mouse ran down
and the blue even slowly falls about the garden trees and walls
they crept over the thick carpet until they came to some stairs what shall we do now hickory asked his brothers let's go down said dock
they had finished their supper
than never now he looked way up to the top of the clock and saw something bright
when they were safe in their nest again did they stop to breathe they were so scared that their little hearts beat fast for an hour
the clock was just telling the time but the big bell was
myself
then they saw that the clock didn't notice them
had been punished enough already for
she kissed each one of them good bye and ran down the wall
more than their parents this adventure could teach you always to listen to your mother
my way i c would go out into the world and see
get to them said mamma
the night
when they
it took time to this because she could only work at night mice like to sleep during the day and work at night at people
then once again the
and they were near the chimney
and they were fat and happy this is
to inside of the clock
up the stairs he ran after them as fast as
he was just about to bite a at a shiny wheel to see what it
quietly i don't know said hickory he was afraid too
oh yes
will
she brought some nice flour with her for breakfast they told her about their adventure she thought
said dickory
children sometimes
that stood on the floor
big enough for t for her to get through and to the kitchen but she was sad to find the bread covered with a pan
when he got to the hall he heard his brothers running
they ate until the last crumb was gone
brothers came after
this so they have to live by stealing food mamma mouse was a brave mouse and knew that it was her job to find food for their her children so she dr dried her eyes and went to work chewing through the board
the wind that came through the roof made it cool in summer
are plenty more things around
so they went down the stairs to the hall
e to eat
and the noise hurt the poor little mouse he screamed with fear and ran
he saw that all was quiet family of people
kept ticking away so they got their courage up and ran about suddenly dickory gave a yell that made his brothers come running
scold them
it may end worse than last night
of cities blazing in the fire till as i gaze with staring eyes the armies fade
don't come out of our nest till i come back
it was now
went with her without her
little dock was wide awake he jumped around in the nest so much that his brothers could not sleep
and even cats sleep some sleep some mice run about in the day but they are not very smart
in the family they there were three children named hickory and dickory and dock

a squirrel lives
the trees of the big forest maybe the trees will keep me warm through the winter he said so he went to the forest hopping and fluttering with his broken wing
the broken wing may keep their leaves
oh big oak tree said the little bird
and every leaf he touched fell to the ground
house
i do not know said the bird the trees will not let me live in
cold
the trees which were kind to the bird will
care of a strange bird said the birch i would
juniper
what a thing to ask said the oak tree if you stay in my branches
may i touch every leaf he said to his father the forest king no said the forest king the trees
spruce here is the warmest one of all
birch
the trees
this
live in your warm branches until the springtime comes
every leaf in the forest he loved to see the trees bark
but branches are not very warm but i can keep the wind off because i am strong
juniper tree saw what the pine and spruce were doing she said that she would give the little bird
you may live on my branches said the sparrow
then the pine tree
i would not talk to strangers the willow
juniper tree kept their leaves through all the winter and they have
so the little bird
the trees which were kind to the bird
the little bird hop
i will like to have you
but one little bird had a broken wing and he could not fly he did not know what to do he looked all around to see if there was any place where he could keep warm
the first tree he came to was a silver
so north wind had to leave them alone
will y you let me
he wanted to touch ev
the spruce when he saw the little bird hopping and fluttering with his broken wing he said
then the j
live with them and my wing is broken and i cannot fly
winter was coming and all the birds flew away to the warm south there there they would wait for the spring
so the little bird fluttered up into the warm branch of this spruce
risk my acorn acorns said the oak
the poor little bird did not know where to go but he hopped and fluttered along with his broken wing
and the
all winter you will be eating my acorns go away
which
but may i stay all winter yes said the spruce i will not
beautiful birch tree he said will you let me live in your warm branches until the springtime comes oh my said the birch what a thing to ask i have to take care of my own leaves through the winter go away
the trees at the edge of the forest talked to each other i wouldn't take
the spruce the pine and the
what a th
he loved to see the trees bare
his dinner for the winter from her branches
said the s
the pine tree was stood beside the
keep kept the wind off his
and all and the three trees stood up very tall and proud
the spruce tree saw him and said where are you going little bird
and they have done so ever since
hopped and fluttered with his broken wing until he came to the willow tree by the edge of the brook
one day a long long time ago it was very
will
oh willow tree he said said the little bird will you let me live in your warm branches until the springtime comes no said the willow tree i never talk to strangers go away
hopped and fluttered with his broken wing until he came to the next tree it was a great big oak tree
that night the north wind came into the woods to play he blew at the leaves with his icy breath
he saw
good choice for the roof france said one afternoon as she checked out their progress
minor seismic activity near here
france nodded animals may feel movement deep in the earth before we can feel it but we can't depend on them we have to learn what to do
and i build our clubhouse
but she still needed some advance from her cousin france
oh
i tore it down that's great france said
like that area by the barn there's probably granite deep
they're still good maria explained it's great to reuse materials francine said but bricks can fall on you during an earthquake
in an earthquake
father walked to her side are you ok france she ran toward him we just had had an earthquake it was very strong but a few dishes fell on the shelves she said
i'm going to find my friends and tell them we we'll start building tomorrow
damage in some parts of the california
the earth this vibration is called seismic waves it's like dropping a stone in a pool of water
deep inside the earth moves the
like building an earthquake proof clubhouse
the walls should be made
france was staying at the
disappeared over the other side maria shook her head
braced on the concrete thanks dad
you don't have to worry but i believe people should be prepared
and breaks apart
as francine speared out the plan on the kitchen table
it was ok only a rock and roll mr ruiz
how maria asked first you need to find a place to build on that's first
is the plan okay
maria was proud of the plan she had drawn
wood
we don't know
a circle she said
of concrete near the barn
what's seismic activity maria asked during more most earthquakes rock
when an earthquake strikes right maria said with a smile
one question at a time france laughed you have a good plan but the walls should be
france was an engineer she'd know the best to build the clubhouse
her cat streaked past calico scrammed up a pile of bricks jumped onto the clubhouse and
we haven't had an earthquake here for a long time mr ruiz said as he came into the kitchen so why worry
the building can be
under the dirt there
do you like it maria asked
i ducked over the table so i'd be safe i'm glad you two were out in the open nothing could fall on you
ok
will there ever be an earthquake near our ranch maria asked
one maria's friends bought a s
maria nodded the stone splashes and and wave go out in
put a brace here and there hey i have an idea mr ruiz looked over france shoulder you can build the clubhouse on that square of
of two not bricks but dad and i dug up the bricks for the old patio
calico had never acted like this then maria felt the ground shake she looked over toward the barn the barn bell was ringing by itself maria couldn't believe what was happening maria could not move
france said earthquakes can have done a lot of
and thanks for your help france maria said
when the broken rock sha shakes it sends out a vibrations that move
firm in an earthquake
when the wood rotten
you need to find a place to build on that's solid
where should my friends
she had everything signed her name at the bottom
are lightweight so it won't hurt anyone if there's an earthquake last job was to make a sign maria had just finished when carl
for sure france said our studies show that there has been some
of for the sides of their building another brought a piece of canvas for the roof when the end of the week the clubhouse was nearly finished
right france said sometimes the earth rolls up and down the earthquake is strong enough it can cause buildings to fall apart but you can make some buildings almost earthquake proof
we used to have a shed there

at night they came on the river bank under the stars and each morning the river looked even lower
cooler
said we must carefully

why do rafts look different then the rest of the river
rafts seemed much higher in the water

a rock slide could make such a sound
it took a long time for her to fall asleep that night
rest of the

our color weigh thirty pounds we can fill three two
all around the water
uncle dan smiled
was not
stay close to the sides of the cliffs he said laurel looked at the water
now watch
quickly they
leaned against the the rock
mysteriously
called
spread it the texas map out
let's find out by estimating said uncle don he pushed an oar to the water til it hit the bottom they then he pulled it out
then she stopped
of a trip
what's rock slide l laura was puzzled

speeding
big rapids asked laura
rock slide but laura had learned something too
how to the trail
rapids it's
at the store laura and her mom carefully weighed the fruit o on the list it weighed thirty four pounds that was a pretty good estimate mom said yes but
too
laurel
rock slide everyone followed
cliff sides it must be deeper here she thought
and because
rats
make weight
rapids
paddles pulling through the water
resting on the bank
everyone got
inside santa help
a junior sized jacket laura wrote on uncle dons raft she cl climbed on the top of the
each one will weigh four pounds that means we can bring thirty pounds of fruit said laurel
the
why are we stopping now laura asked listen whispered uncle
crashed over rocks
lighter she thought i bet
you must carefully pan our
rapids said uncle dan the water is faster too
as he paddled on the
we'll need plenty of daylight when we reach it
gasped
this year he promised to take them
the more you eat the lighter the rafts will be once when we get to rock slide
she said
was that ice chest ice
she looked at the green patch on the left
in his letter uncle to and said
rock slide
it's a surprise
we don't want the rafts to be too heavy
natural
matters uncle don looked worried the river is low it's going to be a rough trip through rock slide
his river trips
rafts in the water she said
rapids
rio grande she asked
the food
a
of rocks
we are going to ride
to measure the
rock slide
repack said
duffle bags in a big plastic jug
the
what is the jugs
at last the raft reached the canyon floor
was

uncle don took everyone
laura stared at the
water poured
bunches of grapes
climbed to rocks over head
got to pack our clothes and pick up some fresh fruit for uncle don
near the cl
with fruit and ice the we'll measure everything
eat up laughed uncle don
raps uncle
measure and weigh our
asked laurel look at the water uncle don explained what is different about the water in the
uncle don is making his
p
missed was thirty one kilograms she could wear a
the next morning
narrow beach
early that afternoon uncle dan decided to stop and camp
poured was the
layers plastic bottles and water and f freeze them
that left float through the
it was darker
raft
to do with luck
mysteriously
she
inflated the rafts and put them in the water laura watched uncle don lower the raft with his supplies the raft sank lower in the water
uncle don was laura's favorite uncle
he
on the dining room table
compared to wet part of the oar
in
mom answered with a smile
she had one sinking through rock slide
big
uncle don smiled just wait you'll find out soon
her mother looked over her shoulder
letter uncle don
distance
rio
jugs were almost empty and
roar
of the river laura saw other
very carefully laurel listened to the roar she wondered how
water uncle don answered in summer people need lots of water each day laura was surprised uncle dan had measured everything carefully before the trip she was glad that they had been so careful with the fruit
into fast
group of the paddles
raft
no not until rock slide
rock slide
seventy two pounds
through the rapids
shallow she said i can see little rocks on the bottom right
she learned that a safe trip
in when laura's boat
that's rock slide uncle don said
but i'd better take off some fruit the next day everyone met al
she pointed to the place
laura spread
laura looked down at the canyon
ing
that's how we'll buy the fruit
soon laura
he said the f

tall bags
on the rafts laura you ride on my
c
don above the splashing
the r river was
uncle
it's lower
measure
we'll also have
at the raft turning
cooking gear
on
laura wondered what rock slide could be
what she she is
we must carefully measure and weigh a
the ice chest is about eighty centimeters long while
and read the words big
what is rock slide axed asked laura
so much maybe she would have been with her cat instead the cat came into my
fur he wouldn't sneeze and that
opinion though i'll bet you didn't know something else
liked oscar as much as the cat
heads out and be not cuddly can i get a dog please
what dad calls life experience not that i shaved the cat though
oh sure it's easy to say that i should have just picked the cat up but sometimes we don't always think
it on purpose
it got really hot
in
you would have a better marriage
else did you know that i wanted to be a barber
anyway
don't let dad know that
a good student
per
cats don't overheat in winter
besides the real reason i shaved the cat was to keep it nice and cool
dear mom and dad parents since you have grounded me and told t me to write down why i am sorry before i was allowed out of my room i am mad at you i would l
i think it really liked its haircut the only reason it hasn't come
cat
could take her
accident turned on the nose hair clippers and the
get a stupid turtle anyway
cat was that i want to be a barber and i needed practice i was afraid you wouldn't let me practice on my own head can i practice by shaving jenny's head i promise that
i knew our cat would grow her fur back but some cats don't have hair
you hate
dear mom and dad jenny didn't brush her teeth last night i think that she sh
she said what that when we should shave hair it grows back harder and sometimes even darker so i thought that if i could shave the cat a lot of a bunch of times her hair would grow back harder
plus
winter i
that it's really jenny's fault for not being as responsible as you're
enough
not shave it itself
you and you know what the stupid gerbils didn't even
ok here's what happened as i remember it
pick the cat up but sometimes we don't always think
fine oscar can't really talk but if he could he would s have said
s invincible coat
it was really my father's day gift to him so i couldn't buy him anything nice since you took away my allowance for when i shaved the neighbor's dog
really re
i
i knew
she's really responsible
should i stop
so in conclusion i'm getting hungry and i'm sorry for shaving the cat
but so what if
that's
in
i forgot to tell you that you should be blaming mrs cas mrs
you guys will just probably say it's winter danny
but for
to start by saying that i think that you are very mean to make me do this because it wasn't even my fault
keeps hitting me on the shell and trying to roll me over
this and poor kitty that
college even if she is a dumb little tattle tale she's so good at school you
be
cat cause
cat now how to listen so she just ignored me
always sneezing and stuff so i thought if
that's just my
she would have an
you always say and not brushing her teeth p s if you would have brought her a turtle i couldn't have shaved it sincerely danny
plus if you weren't always
it'll
my room because jenny never plays with it any
s
if i had a cat i would teach it to
all that great under pressure
i really didn't mean to shave the cat really i swear
v
plus oscar my turtle told me to shave the cat
i was afraid to tell you really
so
actually the truth is that
didn't mean she really responsible
the real reason i shaved the cat was that he's always sneezing around it
you wouldn't always take the cat's side if you knew the stuff he did to my poor turtle cat's aren't always nice just like my sister jenny isn't always nice
so i
winter
my science teacher she made us have
i just didn't want to see the cat getting all hot and uncomfortable and stuff
plus
proud of me
like
on t v shows and get lots of money so that you can send jenny to
out for two weeks is because you guys made such a big deal about it poor kitty sh this
it t
i'll do a better job then i did on the
anyway turtles don't do anything except poke their heads out and
cat was being chased by the turtle and ran right by the slip clippers and shaved her off self i kept saying no kitty no don't have shave yourself but my stupid sister never taught her
should brush her teeth twice tonight
him
they are called hairless cats and they need fur in the winter sometimes i think i swear that's the reason also i was going to sell the cat f fur and buy my sister jenny braces for her big stupid face
al
it w
mean
back harder each time and soon
the cat liked being shaved
thank me they just ran on that stupid wheel and did stupid things that's the last time i shave the cat to protect any stupid gerbils
i saw that the cat was
of cat fur armor then she would be a super cat and you
anyway so i did don't see the big deal
said please shave the cat
i be
the really reason i shaved the cat
how come jenny's jenny gets a cat and i
last night i saw that she didn't brush her teeth oh yeah i forgot to tell you that
how much
i
for sure i don't have to get good grades to know that you should teach a cat to shave itself
it's winter
although you can see that's
she made us shave something for science ask her
al i just wanted the cat to get used to the idea before
just cause she's g good student
dear mom
danny
cas
for thinking so fast on my toes
i couldn't help it anyway it was an accident and i didn't even do it in
school and you brought her a cat cause she's responsible and stuff
when you leave the room you guys never
it's your fault really dad please don't read the next part
ignored me see she's not
now i have
not cuddly
opinion
i got rid of her fur she
be sum soon summer soon enough and
cuddling with my sister
through the trees blowing through the trees then they heard something strange
followed their mother into the house
it was that strange sound
sounds that you
thought the air into our ears mom explained
it's the house that's making the noise i don't
it moved back and forth very fast and it made the air
at the door
a tall bottle makes the
the house
the house really did begin to
i think ramon and
was standing near the fireplace when
the r ramon added
what's that asked rick
string
ramon watched
the air inside and
same kind of
h
i
m
t sat on the back of
ri
rita
the chimney is like a giant bottle
was talking
i never heard a sound
tight back
groan
these ramon
fireplace is making
then a new sound filled a the room it's thunder said mom
maybe it's the wind said ramon
a
it
said the
shorter than the others she blew across the top of it
it go
wrote heard he picked up a bottle
it's not so quiet it's not so quiet said
rita
dad pulled the rubber band
ramon still
the house had groaned come inside
ringing from the
ramon were
he he
what s been
a message to our brain and that's how we hear sounds
she f
a deep sound there is more room inside for the air to vibrate
rita
several boxes sat in the kitchen floor
where
the wind blew again
groan again
he saw nothing but some empty bottles
pulled the rubber band
vibrates
a kite
making those
rita picked up a bottle
he said
ramon
this time ram ramon knew what it was ramon
right asked ramon
he
it's too
their new house
ri
and because it's so tall it
taking dishes out of one box and putting them away
rita finished typing
pull
rita whispered
dad came into the room
ri
the wind
rita raced to close the windows dad closed the doors they finished just in time the wind started
roam
when the wind stops
there must be a storm
did you see the rubber band vibrate
day for flying a kite
their
that's right dad
blew across the top
you're both right she said
there are lots of sounds
said their mother
he missed playing with his friends on their street
will they all make different sounds let's try them said dad each bottle made a different sound i told you there
t blowing trees
here
our ears send
so that
around it move very fast the air moving back and forth those
like it ramon said rita the wind blew
makes
why does the bottle make the sound mom asked rita
became quiet again
everyone looked around
rita right laughed mom as if to be prove the what they had said
they heard a
rita
the bottle
onto
i don't know ramon looked at around the porch
rita
of sounds you want to hear in new york just listen
movements are vibration
are
i hate the country ra ramon said to
they heard the sound again
ri
back porch of
dish
when the wind blows over it the air inside vibrates
behind two fingers
like that in new york
movements are called vibration
that spooky sound
r
we've better shut down shut the windows
made a funny sound
great
there is
the sound stops
the the bottle made sounds like a whistle she said
voice behind them
mom smiled
and
we have many size of bottles
ran he heard soft sound of the wind
missed the city he missed their old school
she
here joke
a shorter bottle makes a higher sound
she felt silly
mom
began to laugh it's not spooky she said it's just the chimney
is that awful noise coming from asked mom
well the air inside the bottle moves back and forth very quickly mom answered
the house
i think it's coming from the fireplace he said
what
and let go of it it moved quickly
what does vibrate mean asked ramon
i think the house is growling whispered ri
ramon listened he heard birds singing
it was short
and then l
odd noises
quiet here
and vibration the sound right asked
held a rubber band in his hand
walked over to the empty bottles on the porch and
ring
it's less room for the air to vibrate dad and
for thinking that
they had moved to the country two weeks ago
s
when you blew across the top of a bottle mom explained
makes really deep sound
the rubber band
just listen to the wind in in the trees
look kids he said i can show you what vibration
he heard cowbells
s slowed down for a moment the
ri
the house quiet
blowing harder suddenly
m woman
smiled at her brother
asked dad
it starts when the wind blows
said dad
mother was standing
they're just not the same kinds of
those vibrations move the
there
through the
were lots of things to hear around here
we can talk while i work ramon and rita picked up the bottles and
dinosaurs all as big as a bus
eat was it friendly he asked
or whatever
scott looked at the first the feet of the huge
here it is this is my dinosaur
second the toe bone you found is large
the mole ducked into a hole
but taffy didn't care
he may be the be the best dinosaur hunter of all
dr lewis smiled suddenly scott looked worried
a real fossil scott was excited
scott answered
scientists who are study fossils
the fossil to the museum
dr lewis showed them a giant footprint
that's really big said scott
finally duckbill the dinosaurs lived in herds and
it to his parents
taffy and scott were lost in in a cloud of dust
i can't say that word
there was something special about this bone
taffy taffy where are you cried scott
when the dust settled the mole was gone
no said dr lewis
they all wanted to help very much
but
ate plants like cows
dr lewis carefully opened scott's paper bag
the
asked
you're right scott
this dinosaur was over ten meters long
and began to dig
scott had a had a feeling
new road
why don't you take the fossil on your trip to the science museum
then scott
uh
you're right scott
she led them
the rest of your duckbill a you children can watch and s scott
taffy made in tra ta tracks taffy made in the mud
it is a bone that it has been under ground for millions of years and has turned into rock
what's a paleontologist said asked scott
maybe my fossil is a bone from a real dinosaur scott thought
he is digging where you are building your new road scott raced past the dump tracks trucks
look taffy
try to match the toe bone sh
also called duckbills
no this toe bone is square
like how tall was it
she looked surprised
imagine a whole herd of
scott gasped
wait wait
dr lewis smiled
it came from an adult
taffy barked
he didn't even mind where when scott took the bone
dr lewis are dr lewis are there more bones or any tracks by the
the children looked at the dinosaurs one by one
his mother said
my dog taffy dug dug it up near the new new road
they work to understand what life on earth was l like millions of years ago
dr irene lewis a paleontologist was waiting for the the class
of in a rock
we may find
he thought about the tracks
they were surprised this is a special bone it is very heavy said his father i think it is a fossil
paleontologist
scott knew that taffy liked to dig in the dirt i know where taffy is he thought
they will wait for us to look f for fossils then they will finish the road
then scott was the bone
h
look at each dinosaur
this is was made by a large dinosaur called
what did it look
it has to huge teeth and pointed toe bones said scott's friend julie
she took out the fossil
do now
come all over here and i'll show show you another kind of fossil said dr lewis
or about as long as a bus
dirt flew everywhere
scott went home he was he washed the bone and sh showed
that
do i start here or here
will the dump trucks destroy them
noticed the skeleton of the of a
you can show it to a
she asked them to to help her find out which dinosaur it came from
like a duck bill
wow said scott
these toe bones are too big he decided how about
you must bring taffy along
where did you find this she asked
wow a fossil
paleontologists are science
that night scott dreamed of huge dinosaurs two days later scott carried
he saw taffy chasing a mole
you found a bone scott cried
then he shouted
she said
or duckbill dinosaurs

tired people and hot animals are happy for our shade children love to play under us
in fresh and quiet green it is bare and brown without us
but we do not die

the light winds stay with us and play with us and the leaves felt very proud and important
we make cool shade on the green grass said the flapping leaves
you can come

click now rosa had pictures of all her animal friends two days later the pictures were were re ready you took ni

rosa put
you saw a falling star falling stars look
dad gives the star chart to rob then
meter shot across the sky and all stars were still there
rob wake rob wake up said john i saw a star fall
phone rang rosa put down her new camera she went to a door she saw mrs fine her neighbor hi rosa
they that they live there i'll if i show you will you plant your garden someplace else it's a deal said mrs fine rosa went home she got her camera she also got some bread the bread will make the animals come out
he hugged the boy
on the chart all the stars are here you s your star didn't fall from the big dipper the boys counted the stars in other patterns none were missing what's wrong boys dad asked we can't find the missing star said rob one should be missing said john i saw it falling
and so does a chipmunk if you cut down the tree
in the morning john looked for
bread he carried it to his hole in the tree click rosa took a picture of him going into his hole rosa waited for
dad asked no dad a squirrel lives in the tree too i
i will said rosa she walked across the grass to mrs fine's house rosa showed mrs fine the pictures mrs fine was surprised now you did a good job mrs fine
down that tree but the shade from that tree will stop my garden from going
what you saw was a meter
dad showed the boys a chart this chart shows
and call this great bear
up look cried john just then another
more about s
fine you must prove
dad smiled
said rosa
went to build a fire let's count stars in the big dipper rob said maybe one star is gone then we'll know where your star came from john counted the stars in the big dipper i see seven stars he said rob counted the dots
rob
there
is that all
when he felt safe he took some
oh no said rosa please don't cut
bits of bread around the tree then she moved back from the tree the mother bird came first she took some bread and flew back to her nest click went rosa c camera the chipmunk ran around the tree when he
like stars but they aren't stars
dad went to build a fire let's count s
s a star fall it must have landed behind those trees rob looked out of the tent it was very dark the sky was full of stars rob did not see a falling star go back to sleep j
mrs fine said is your dad home i'm right here said dad can i help you i want a to plant a garden said mrs fine i want to cut down that old tree it is half on my land and half on yours do you mind if i

but why do they
salmon get bigger they swim away
called
except all except two
you have to remember that even though he's gifted at being slow he's still very young and said swish's father
this time it was a bit closer than you would have liked i'll bet
he told his mom you know what i'm going to win this race
mud said to swish there's no way that a turtle as young as you can be so slow even i was faster than you when i was your age
finally after the long journey all the turtles arrived at great pond
mud still didn't answer in fact mud was sound asleep mud had actually sung himself to sleep
swish was sad that he lost but all the turtles from blue pond cheered for swish
just to get to the race
every s seen
they looked at the horizon and saw the sun was starting the rise
his name was mud
you know my grandfather raced mud once
there was lots of eating and laughing
everyone treated swish differently for example
go slow instead all the turtle must go as fast as they can at all times
swish and mud were both back at the starting line it looked as if neither of them had moved at all
once his mother called him for in for dinner and he didn't make it home until breakfast the next morning and he was
that's because no one could ever beat the turtle from there
but though he
i never promised that i would win the race
how come they don't move that big rock out of the middle of the field it seems to be in everyone's way said swish
he was the biggest most respected and one of the trickiest turtles in history
every four years turtles from all over the land would crawl to great pond
the turtle cup was the trophy that
all the other turtles at
ms tort went up to swish and gave him the turtle cup
a new turtle born in blue pond
after seven days of playing and dancing a bug eating finally
there were thousands of turtles of many different species all having a great name
then mud tried another trick
swish took the cup that day
ms snapper would say hi swishy do you want some yummy pie to fill up and slow you down for the big race a fat turtle and is a slow turtle
you aren't running
had only moved a few inches
most nice turtles lived in blue pond
rule number one the great race begins at sunrise and ends at sunset
he hadn't had to move for over fifty years
right at the end right before the sunset swish started to pull ahead of mud
much greater or bigger than mud
there were about three hundred turtles racing
what you think like to say
mud kept singing his lullaby for a few hours but stopped right before sunset
he thought it was the most wonderful thing ever
mud from sludge pond has been disqualified for sleeping during the race
said swish's mom
except for mud of course
when mud was hi in his prime there was
you''re just trying to make me quit i'm not going to fall for your tricks he said turtles never cheat and i'm a turtle with honor
everything about the festival was fun but the main event was the great turtle race
we all want you to look good when you bring home the cup
rule number four no turtle may fall asleep since if you are asleep you can't
after six hours mud and swish were still tied and
only a foot away
the rules were nailed to a tree they read
the crowd thought h he must have realized that it wasn't working but then
imagine he had
became the greatest turtle or and biggest turtle of all time
the slowest turtles from each pond were carried to the starting line by members of their village
swish made a loud gulp sound
there was many legends about him
when all the tu
rule number three no turtle may pretend to be going as fast as they can but
i think that you'll be a great champion for many years since turtles only get slower with age
when swish was born everyone thought he was a little slow but as he got a little older
the winner would take home to their village
swish read the rules even though he knew them by heart
it was because of swish that blue pond became the most respected pond in the land
but after a few hours the most of the turtles had gone a few feet
the mayor of great pond went to present the turtle cup to sludge pond again
swish s started yawning he was tired from racing and thought that it would be nice just to listen to mud's sweet voice and fall asleep
look there's your cousin peek a boo from big puddle village and swish's mother you'll get to meet all sorts of new turtles
mister peeks would never do anything for free but he was giving swish a free shell waxing
as fast as you can
mud knew that this would be his closest raced ever and he was actually getting a little bit scared of s this swish kid
swish had to be carried on his father's back
the crowd started yelling speech speech
so with swish they could
and when the sun went down mud was the closest turtle to the starting line
it's just an honor
the mayor doctor softshell said this is ridiculous swish has to race
the turtles stretched and thought really slow thoughts as they did the sky
we never thought of that they agreed
he put earplugs in his ears and couldn't hear mud's singing anymore
i know it and all these turtles will know that
ladies and gentlemen said ms tort
you're cheating you're going to ruin the great race forever
this was swish's first ever shell dwellers festival
they were very proud and gave mud such a
and he was the greatest champion of the h in the history of shell dwellers festival he was unbeatable
he wasn't as slow as you but he did teach me a thing or two
just then the mayor said ready set slow and off they went
mister peeks he the local shell cleaner would say hey there swish do you want a free shell waxing today
i would like to present the turtle cup to blue pond
since turtles never cheat this is the most important rule to break this rule would mean to end to the great turtle race forever
turtles could catch up with friends they had not seen since the last festival
but swish wouldn't let mud scare him
p posted the rules of the race for everyone to see
then they the town promised to treat swish like a normal turtle and after a while swish decided
they were both moving of course but they were so slow that it was hard to tell
i can't beat mud anyway i heard once it took him three days just to yawn
runners please take your positions
he was the slowest turtle of all time
that's not a rock sweetie said his mom that's mud
that was the most exciting finish we we've ever had
it would take some turtles f from far away villages two whole weeks just to get there
the day of the race came
this turtle was named swish
for the first time he would take it many more times after that
she said swish you are the youngest winner of the great race
he deep down inside he knew he was just as slow as mud
but he doesn't want to be treated special he just wants to be a normal
time before anyone could figure out which turtles were the slowest
ms snapper was never nice to anyone but she was being nice to swish
he started singing a soft beautiful lullaby
the festival
but they all felt a little sad because they hadn't held the turtle cup in over seven hundred years
rule number two all turtles must run as fast as they can and the turtle that is closest to the starting line wins
when the time of the festival drew near all the turtles all over the land started to crawl toward great pond
by now all the turtles were way ahead of mud but this time swish was just as slow
all the turtles in blue pond held a meeting to discuss the problem
he always made sure that no one treated him special and that he treated everybody like he wanted to be treated like a turtle with honor
they were all the slowest of slow
smiled and said i know that you can win swish but we'll be proud of you even if you don't win
oh no shouted the fans mud's winning it looks like muds is still the greatest turtle of them all
and wondered about it
the slowest turtle
the tur get and the longer they live so you can see winning the great race is a great honor
blue pond rules i'm not afraid of mud
this means that we have a new champion but the real winner is swish softbelly of blue pond the crowd went wild
close race
swish saw a big rock in the middle of the big festival
then he told swish about all of mud's dirty tricks so that swish would be ready for them
swish was happy too but he didn't
but without him we don't have a chance
all the turtles were very very slow so it took some
the crowd went wild again
saw
the winner of the great turtle race was so important that the winner didn't have to move for four years until the next festival
blue pond was located about three days crawl from great pond
that he would be proud to race for his village
so one day he told his parents i don't want to race
swish's mom
it was rumored he was so slow his heart would only beat once a day
swish's father said son don't worry about it
turned from black to dark blue
they thought maybe just maybe he could bring back the turtle cup
for the first time in seven hundred years
the turtles began to realize that swish was really really really slow
the mayor of great pond ms tort
sure they are nice to me now because they think i can win the race but if i lose they'll be disappointed and mad at me
he went he would never lose the turtle cup for the rest of his long life
then he heard the mayor say
the turtle cup was in sludge pond o for over fifty years
she announced well mud it looks like you've done it sludge pond wins the turtle cup again
and he doesn't want everybody to hate him if he can't beat mud
all the extra attention made swish very uncomfortable
then he snapped out of it and remembered his father told him about this trick
swish was suddenly very excited
mud didn't answer the mayor tapping mud on the shell and said hello hello mud
who is this young punk he thought to himself
since it would have taken him years to get to great pond by himself
he was the slowest turtle i've ev
breathing a great sigh of relief that's when brother bear looked up at his fingernails and piped up
sister nibbles her nails sister nibbles her nails it didn't take sister long to decide to pull off those bits of tape
you know i think i ju i might start biting my nails i could use the money
before mama could answer sister bear who had who had been nervous nervously nibbling in the next room popped in and said a dime ten whole cents every day just for not biting my nails
that's the way it is with a bad habit the more you use it the harder it is to get out of it here this is where i want to plant the bulbs
what an interesting idea said mama as she listened to the wise old grizzly gran
you've nibbled d your nails down to nubbins in fact you've nibbled them clean off how did it happen
by stan and jan berenstain
and sister nibbled her nails nibble nibble nibble nibble
all she got was discouraged
i could read the riot act to her
it's very hard to hold a pencil with tape and all over your fingertips or tune the tv or scratch when you have an itch and when sister tried to play jacks she couldn't get any higher than tw twosies
the berenstain bears and the bad habit
is something you do so often you don't even have to think about it habits are a very important part of our lives and most of them are good like brushing your teeth and combing your fur when you get up in the morning and looking both ways before you cross a road
by the way it tur but the way it turned out she didn't get a single dime
there was quite a lot of work spelling number problems and all kinds of things
hmm said mama well here's what we'll do we'll put a little medicine on the sore ones and bits of adhesive tape on all of them that will remind you not to nibble and will give them back a chance to grow back
i suppose so said papa thoughtfully perhaps some sort of reward would help a bit of money let's say a dime for every day she doesn't bite her nails
first there had been a been nursery school which was pure fun playing with dolls and blocks rolling clay snakes and scribbling with crayons
well said mama it's sort of like this path i've wheeled this barrow over it so many times that i've it's worn a deep rut right down the middle
before she knew it she had nibbled down to nub nib nubbins in fact she nibbled them down so far that some of her fingers were getting sore
oh well sighed mama life goes on i must call gran and thank her for the tulip bulbs
dear me no said mama nail biting is a kind of nervous habit and shouting and threatening will just make her more nervous
great for picking things up tuning the tv and scratching itches and the next time she played jacks she got all the way to tensies
i certainly hope you're joking roared papa because if you're not i'm joking i'm joking interrupted br brother and he was sort of
a habit mama said as she well pushed the wheelbarrow along with the along the well worn path
now sister was in first grade regular regular school was different it was still fun and she liked teacher jane very much but it wasn't all fun
that's right said papa until the habit's broken i'll never nibble again she said as she thought of all those lovely dimes she was going to get
what about my nail biting habit asked sister as she helped mama get out of the deep rut how am i going to get out of it
i'm not exactly sure mama sh sister said but some of them are getting sore
so they tried gran's idea instead of a dime at the end of each day they gave sister ten pennies one for each nail and at the beginning of each day ten pennies to keep unless she nibbled
but worst of all the bits of tape told the whole world that sister bear was a nail nibbler
sister bear who lived with ma mama papa and brother in the t big tree house down a sunny dirt road deep in bear country had been going to school for quite a while
oh yes said sister but i keep forgetting why is it so hard to remember
like nail biting asked sister you would like to nail your have you nice nails grow back wouldn't you was mama's answer
a day is a long time and habits are powerful especially bad habits even with the promise of a dime sister couldn't remember not to nibble mama and papa got discouraged too
but even better she had ten fine fingernails
lizzy twirled her for fur twirl twirl twirl freddy scratched his head scratch scratch scratch norman sucked his thumb suck suck suck
but some habits aren't so good
in regular school you have to concentrate and sometimes when you concentrate you form little nervous habits that's what happened to some of the cubs in teacher jane's class
you just need a little help that that's all said mama let's plant gran's tulips where i think about it or while i think about it and later i'll talk to your papa he may have some ideas
the bits of tape helped sister remember not to nibble but they also got in the way when she tried to do certain things
not perfectly it's hard to break a habit and sister had to give back some of those pennies but in ten days she had ninety three pennies
the next morning when sister lined up for school lizzy bruin and some others began pointing and teasing
next had come kindergarten that was fun too there were marching games and rhythm band she also learned a lot of numbers in kindergarten and most of the alphabet
and it keeps getting deeper every time i use it why is it so deep that i can't get out of it with a little help
oh dear said mama bear to sister when the cubs got home from school one day
what you have what have you tried so far uhm uh huh well i think you're on the right track with the dime but instead of a dime and instead of giving it to her at the end of the day
oh you're very welcome my dear said gran when mama called and how is everything at your house is that so you know i was a nail biter when i was a cub and my mama helped me to stop
phew said papa bear i'm glad that's over yes indeed agreed mama
that's just my opinion though
can i get a dog please
plus i forgot to tell you that uhm that you should be balan balance
rea
i think it really liked liked i really it really liked its haircut
didn't mean to shave uhm shave the cat uhm shave the cat really i s i swear
you you guys will just uh probably say it's it's winter d it's winter danny u cats don't ev o
the
po uhm poor kitty this and poor kitty that it's your fault really dad please don't read the next part
he uhm you should be proud of me for thinking so fast on my toes
so so in conclusion i'm getting hungry and i'm sorry for shaving the cat although you can see that it's really jenny's fault for not being as responsible
fine oscar can't really talk but if he could he would save he would have said please shave the cat it it keeps hitting me on the shell and trying to roll me over when you leave the room you guys never l uh li uhm liked oscar as much as the cat anyway
i would like to start by saying that i think that you are very mean to make me do this because
that by accident turned on the nose hair clipper and the cat was being chased by
uhm yeah besides the real reason i shaved the cat was to keep it nice and cool
and and you told us we cou he could he could hit animals
the how to lis listen so she just ignored me she uhm see she's not so responsible after all
re
tattle'tale
i swear that's the reason al also i was going to sell the cat
i uh i know how much you hate you hate him always sneezing and stuff so i thought if i got rid of his fur he wouldn't sneeze and that and that
they just ran on the stupid wheel and d and did and did stupid things like the last time i shaved the cat to pro protect any stupid gerbils
i was uhm afraid you wouldn't let me practice on my
a lot of a bunch of times her hair would grow back harder each time
h uhm s her a if you if you m if ps
shouldn't teach the cat to shave itself
s uhm dear mom and dad parents
i'll bet you didn't know something else
not n not that i shaved the cat though
then she would be a be a super cat and uhm and you and you could take her on tv shows
the release the
and get lots of money so that you can send jenny to col to col to college even if she's a dumb little
i saw that the cat was trying to get the ge
she made us shave something for science ask her she said that when we shaved
cats don't overhear heard
the cat was being cha uhm chased by the the turtle and ran right by the clippers and shaved herself i kept i kept saying no no kitty no don't shave yourself
they they are called hairless cats
uhm i don't
oh sure it's easy to say that i should have just picked the cat up but
so i thought that if i could shave shave the cat i uhm a a lot of a
as you always say and not brushing her teeth
cat's aren't aren't always nice just like my sister jenny j uhm just like my sister jenny isn't always nice
i know that that you should uhm
but the
cutting c you weren't always cu cuddling with my sister so much maybe she would have been with her cat instead of instead the cat came into my room because jenny never plays with it
it uhm it wasn't very uh uhm it wasn't even my fault i couldn't i could couldn't help it anyway
uhm the cat was being chased by
this and poor kitty that
we couldn't hit h we couldn't animals so i don't know what else to do so i grabbed dad's nose hair clippers clippers and shaved it
the realest reason the realest reason i shaved the cat was to make a wig for those poor hair less cats
just cause she's a good student doesn't mean she's really responsible last night i saw that she didn't brush her teeth oh yeah i forgot to tell you that
uhm and that you would have a better marriage so if so it was really my father's day gift to him i couldn't buy him anything nice since you took away my allowance for when i shaved the
cat's fur and buy my sister jenny braces for her big stupid face
practice on my on my own head can i practice by shaving jenny's hair
and sometimes even darker
the best bester be the better i'll do a better job then i did on the cat because now i have what dad calls life experience
our our of cat fur armor
okay here's what happened as i remember it
the only reason it hasn't come out for two weeks is because you guys made such a big deal about it
blaming mrs mister casper my science my science teacher
the neighbor's dog how come jenny gets a cat
w our i knew our cat would grow her fur her fur back but some cats don't have fur
dear mom don't let dad know that the real reason i shaved the cat was that he's always sneezing around it
you wouldn't always take the cat in you wouldn't always take the cat's side if you knew the the stuff he did to to to my poor turtle
i just didn't want to be the cat
if i had a a cat i would teach teach it to not shave itself that's for sure i don't have to i don't have to get good grades to know that the
plus oscar plus o plus oscar
she's so good at school you a that she's so good at school and uhm and you bought her a cat cause she's so responsible and stuff
poor kitty this and poor kitty that
and i just wanted the cat to to get us to the i get the cat what i just wanted the cat to get us t used to the idea before it got really hot
grows back hard and
poor uh pos pop their head out and be not
the realest
plus if you if you weren't always cud
and soon she would have an invincible coat of cat fur all
if you would have uhm have bought her a turtle i could i couldn't have shaved it sincerely dan
since you have gar uhm gar gard gardened me and told me to write down why i am sorry before i was allowed out of my room i am mad at i am mad at you
did you know uhm that i wanted to be a barber
actually the tr the truth is that i i
poor kitty this
but my stupid sister never taught her cat how to lis uhm lis listen to
and i get a stupid turtle anyway turtles don't do anything except
sometimes we don't always think we don't always th think all that great under pressure and you know what those stupid gerbils didn't even th uhm thank me
i was afraid to tell you the real reason i shaved the cat was that i want to be a barber and i needed practice
and they need uhm fur in the winter sometimes i think
but the the real the realest
ps if you want if you won't have bought her a turtle it what if you wouldn't have bought her
it was an ac ac it was an accident and i didn't even do do it on purpose i really
enough the cat likes being shaved alway anyway so i don't i don't see the big ide idea
i just didn't want to i just didn't want to see the cat getting all hot and uncomfortable and stuff
the for when i shaved the night the
i know our cat would grow her
p plus oscar my turtle told me to shave the cat
uhm that no to know that you should teach you should teach a cat to shave itself
dear mom and dad jenny didn't brush her teeth last night i think that she should brush her teeth twice tonight
uhm that we saw on tv on the animal channel
cuddly
it grows back harder
i prom promised that i'll do the
and
bamboo is very uh very workable substance
i see fred
such nonsense going to the moon s said her mother poo poo
after all it's the only home you know besides if you leave i'll get terribly out of shape
i've never seen anything like it
they were in order of cuteness yin yin the young daughter poo poo the mother and moo moo man moo man the gentle always sleepy father
one morning one more thing sir about those magpies flying above the pandas do you think that the zoo could purchase a large si me a large sized umbrella
so all the other people at the zoo would know that the pandas had just been fed when they saw fred hugging a rather un cuddly palm tree outside the panda's home
knew what knew what
the zoo keeper said good heavens man that is a great idea
yes but how many more i'm not sure exactly replied maggie
he didn't mind handling the raw meat he had to feed the to the tigers his main objection was being eaten
how to turn your head all the way around
maggie figured if she and three of the her strongest magpie friend were to each grab hold of one corner of the rocket ship they could fly to the moon so they tried
a lot of it a lot of bamboo can get quite heavy so because of the pandas fred became a very became very strong and was in terrific shape
why did the a panda with th the beautiful girl yin yin have her name changed to the very un beautiful girl name columbus
yin yin's and her best friend maggie the magpie who looked a lot like a panda would look if
eat bamboo pandas eat bamboo
i'm sorry to say but many little boy's cheeks have been made raw when mother poo poo panda was upset
this can almost certainly be accounted for by this strange almost magical effect that the panda possess
a week later m maggie managed to round up two hundred thousand and seventy eight magpies
quicker way to get around europe in order to improve trade he wanted to be a business man but instead he became a great explorer
fred was not allowed to actually hug the pandas
oh wise owl i have a question that i fear y only you can answer
t'wouldn't be best to fly
one day after fred had fed the pandas a
and pandas tend to handle bamboo a lot so this in itself was not so astonishing
but he was supportive of his daughter and showed his support by taking a nap
an instant later
but yin yin the young panda was not listening to fred she was talking to her best friend maggie the magpie about going to the moon
many people know the pandas
back in the panda's f home the mother panda poo poo was very proud of her daughter
the owl instantly replied two hundred thousand seventy six give or take two
they were talking about since they hadn't taught thought or talked much else since yin yin said i want to go there and pointed to the moon
well sir when columbus got out set out on his ship he was really trying to find a
t'wouldn't it be best to ask owl then he closed an eye
some people do not like to bite their finger nails but fred wasn't a nail biter
actually it was eighty five point five degree spot where o spot on his kidney but the point is that he was very fond of feeding the pon pandas
without getting a terrible pain in your neck o said owl
i see your wings flapping but i don't see them going anywhere said yin yin
the other reason was that anyone who gets within three feet of the panda automatically falls in love with them
fred fed the panda bears the tigers the turtles and the turtles
a week later despite much flapping they were still trying to get the rocket into the air
one morning fred was feeding yin yin and said y oh yin yin i wish i w that more people would come visit the zoo
did you know that since the little panda c built the bamboo rocket ship and those magpies started fluttering about that the zoo's profits have gone up four thousand percent
but later when fred walked into the panda's home under his new yellow umbrella umbrella she could think only to say nonsense
but everything was not all bamboo and hugs at the zoo
yes but why does that have to do with yin with the panda's name a said the zoo manager
your job is to be cute so people want to run to the gift shop and buy panda bear dolls
i think the zoo need is a great advertising campaign campaign
is going on
yin yin's father moo man didn't think it was very proper or wise for a young panda bear to go rolling off to places where she there wasn't any bamboo
she said spitefully
now if you you'll excuse me i need to squeeze something before i scream
it's taken me a couple of weeks to figure it out but i think
would be needed to fly a four hundred pound panda bear and a one hundred pound bamboo rocket ship to the moon
the zoo manager laughed and walked away but he but did purchase a fashionable yellow umbrella for fred the next day
at further distances pandas have a strange almost magical effect
the father watching this all through one eye for he always had at least one eye asleep at all times said
no wait a second i don't understand
and your family to the big zoo in san angeles an that's san angeles okay uhm if we don't get enough money
now while all this was going on what do you suppose fred was doing
no one could blame fred really since no one really wants to be eaten
when it came to the pandas he had a warm spot in his heart
bears since
one two three to the moon they said together pulling with all their might
but physical fitness was not the only reason fred loved the pandas
it was fred's idea so let''s begin with fred
yin yin was always the one to take good advice from her father
oh well that makes sense then
she could be be very persuasive a very persuasive little bird when she wanted
i've becoming very good at it i don't think it will take that long to roll there said yin yin
they would have to move from their wonderful home
what sort of nonsense is this for a young panda bear going to the moon indeed nonsense
selling enough stuffed panda bears it's just that we that there haven't been enough people coming to the zoo
nonsense said the mother i'm so mad i'm gonna going to
for fred
the main obstacle it turns out was getting the rocket ship off the ground
the panda
at least to the yin yin's parents fred sure was impressed though
a young boy was heard saying ow mom cut that out
yes the big one in the sky that is most likely to not be made of cheese and most certainly not made out of bamboo
yin yin wants to go to the moon and the magpie wants to take her there
but i just learned how to make myself into a ball and roll two days ago
after all if it weren't for yin yin
on human beings which makes us want to hug and squeeze things
so maggie flew to owl and asked for advice
enough of this nonsense said yin yin's mother poo poo
it's not that you aren't s coming
why he was feeding the pandas like he was supposed to
so being eaten was definitely not something he looked forward to each afternoon at three o'clock when it was time to feed the tigers
there were three pandas and they were known as pan the pan family
so before he ran off to hug a palm tree he quickly said it costs more so much to feed you panda bears i would hate if you had to leave us
after fred fed the pandas h and he was hugging a palm tree the zoo manager came up to him and said what's going on with your panda fred
that could be dangerous
no how many magpies would it
it's the law of nature
hmm heavier than i thought i think we'll need more magpies
fred thought about it and said you know i think we should rename yin yin columbus
i know i shouldn't be telling you this we might be able to sell but we might have to sell you
it turns out that the owl didn't take into consideration that once you get over one thousand magpies together they tend to fight and can't agree on a single thing
the turtles weren't so bad but as for the tigers he wasn't so sure
and less than a week later yin yin and maggie had built a rocket ship out of bamboo
this is just the type of exposure we needed those pandas will be with us for a long time
her mother and father knew what
as for yin yin she was very proud to be renamed after a famous explorer and she she and the magpie maggie never stopped trying to get to the moon
well it seems to me sir yin yin wanted to be a great ex explorer but instead became a business woman
it's simple economics like it or not we are spokespeople for pandas for panda stuffed animals industry which young lady helps pay for the bamboo you eat
look at that young that lady over the there and make her want to squeeze her sons cheeks
poor kitty this is this and poor kitty that it's your fault really dad please don't read the next part
i i knew our cat would grow her fur back but some cats don't have hair they're called hairless cats they need fur in the winter sometimes i think
so i grabbed dad grabbed dad's nose hairs clippers and shaved it
i was afraid to tell you the real the real reason i shaved the cat was that i want to be a barber and i needed practice
a and so what if it's winter but i mean i mean it'll be summer soon enough soon enough and i'll and i just wanted the cat to get used to the idea before it got really hot plus oscar my turtle told me to shave the cat
since you have grounded me and told me to write down why i'm i am sorry before i was allowed out of my room i am mad at you
just cause she's a good student doesn't mean she's really responsible
how come jenny gets a cat and i get a stupid turtle anyway turtles don't do anything except for poke their heads out and not be cuddly
then she would be a super cat and you could tell and you could take her on tv shows and get lots of money so that you can send jenny her cat because she's so responsible and stuff
i kept saying no kitty don't no don't shave yourself but the st my stupid sister never taught her cat how to listen so she just ignored me
i know how much you hate him always sneezing and stuff so i thought if i get rid of its fur he wouldn't sneeze and that you would have a better marriage so that's really why my father's day gift to him
plus i forgot to tell you that you should be blaming mrs casper my science teacher she made us shave something for science ask her she said that when we shave hair it grows back harder and sometimes even darker
and do you know what those stupid gerbils didn't even thank me they just ran on that stupid wheel and did stupid things that's that's the last time i shave the cat to protect my any stupid gerbils
i promise i'll that i'll do a better job then i did on the cat because now i ha now i have what dad calls life experience that's not that's n that's not i shaved the cat though
plus if you weren't always cuddling with my sister so much maybe she would have been she would have been with her cat instead the cat came into my room because jenny never plays with it enough
you wouldn't you wouldn't always take the cat cat's side if you knew the stuff he did to my poor turtle cat's aren't always nice it just just like my sister jenny isn't always nice
i really didn't mean to shave that cat shave the cat really i swear ok here's what happened as i remember it
dear mom and dad jenny didn't brush her teeth last night
ps if you really if you could have bought her a turtle i wouldn't shaved it sin sincerely danny
dear mom don't let dad know the real reason i shaved the cat he's always sneezing around it
i swear that's the reason also i was g going to sell the cat the cat fur and buy my sister jenny braces for her f big stupid face
you you you should be proud of me for thinking sometimes why we shouldn't always think that all that that that think all that great under pressure
it was af i was afraid you wouldn't let me practice on my own head can i practice sha by shaving jenny's head
i i know i i did i don't have to get good grades to know what you should teach a cat to shave itself
fine oscar can't really talk but if he could he would have said please shave the cat it keeps hitting me on the shell and trying to roll me over when you leave me in when you leave the room you guys never liked oscar as much as the cat anyway
i would like to start by saying that i think you are very mean to make me do this because it wasn't even my fault i couldn't help it anyway it was an accident and i didn't even do it on purpose
j last night i saw she didn't even brush her teeth oh yeah i forgot to tell you that
can i get a dog please so in conclusion i'm getting hungry and i'm sorry for shaving the cat although you can see that it's really jenny's fault for not being responsible as you can say as you can always say and not brushing her teeth
see she's not responsible after all if i had a cat i would teach it to to not to not shave itself that's for sure
you guys will probably just say it's winter danny cats don't overheat in the winter
dear mom and dad parents
i couldn't i couldn't buy him anything nice since you took away my allowance for when i shaved the neighbor's dog
so i thought if i would sh should could shave the cat a lot a lot a bunch of times her hair would grow back harder each time and she would soon she would be an invincible coat of cat fur armor
besides the real reason i i shaved the cat was to keep it nice and cool i didn't want the t to see the cat getting all hot and uncomfortable and stuff
actually the truth is that i by accident turned on the nose hair clippers and the cat was being chased by the turtle and ran right by the clippers and shaved herself
the cat liked being shaved anyway so i don't see the big deal i i think it really likes its haircut the only reason it hasn't come out for two weeks is because you guys made such a big deal about it
the realest reason i shaved the cat was to make a big wing a wing for the those poor hair less cats that we saw on tv on the animal channel
i saw the cat was trying i saw that the cat was trying to get the gerbils so you and you told us we couldn't hit the animals so i wouldn't didn't know what else to do
i think sh that she should brush her teeth twice tonight that's my opinion though i th i bet you didn't know something else did did you know that i wanted to be a barber
the flies hate
so they decided that
then he played the song for police chief sanders
because as bad as the flute sounded
everybody looked really silly at dances
flies anymore
be
they had to cover their ears from the horrible sound
he played many musical instruments
a a big band played as they marched up and down the street
th why did they ever invent ears
but i feel like i have to do have to or else bad things will happen
but soon after that they started to get flies
why can't
on a big girl
still it's not as bad as millions of flies i suppose
and guess what
the police chief hated the sound so much that he threw john in jail
oh well good thing i brought my old flute as a back up
and no flute problem
people w would run away screaming
you should know a little bit about the town of franksville
doctor wong came up with an idea
that's how
what should they do
the flies flew away as fast as they could
the way his the way his mouth was shaped
then another
and then multiply that times a hundred
where down where no one could hear him john thought that was an okay idea
said police chief sanders
so he would swat at at them with his hand or even his new flute
well i'm sure
it was
the neighbors are complaining and cats
pretty soon tons of flies
he wasn't called rooster john yet that came later
no fly problem
john in jail since he wasn't really breaking any laws so there was nothing the police could do
it was too late
john could play the flute and everyone else would have
from then on
they just couldn't lead a normal life
then suddenly
the tuba the piano and the clarinet
john would wake up at sunrise like a rooster and play to keep the flies away
maybe a poorly played flute doesn't sound all that bad
i've heard you play the clarinet
to do so he just kept on playing his flute
to wear earplugs
jo john the dentist is driving the flies away
then the flies stopped
we can't let you play the flute anymore john said police chief sanders
then one landed on everything
the bad flute player was rooster john
the flute sounded normal and it turned out john could play it quite well
but they couldn't keep
no no don't play your old flute
were on the main float
he was an excellent dentist but his real love was music
why
before they knew it the town was filled with flies again
their problems started when they ran out of water
that's how the flute sounded when this guy played it
doctor wong thought for a second then pronounced
they could keep they couldn't keep john in jail
made a flute sound as so bad that his fish would jump out of their fish bowl
would have to take the good with the bad
no one could hear anything people were getting in car accidents and
were landing on everyone
since he
when the townsfolk heard the noise they couldn't even swat at the f
joh
and all the
it was a lot better than thousands of flies crawling on them
dancing to music they couldn't hear
since he had become the town dentist everybody's teeth were much whiter and cleaner and nobody an
such as the guitar
everyone cheered
no one had any cavities
the flies would land all over the people and they couldn't swat them off it was gross
look john
john didn't know what
they got tons and tons of flies
john's flute playing as much as we do
it worked doctor wong was the town hero
doctor wong and john were the s stars of the parade so they
he was the new town dentist
then other one landed
franksville was a town that seemed to have one problem after the other
he thought that
then w
oh that's a nice instrument but it's just not the flute
he started shaking the flute to get the flies off and accidentally smashed it into pieces
but there was an echo in the well that made the flute sound louder
the cats and dogs are trying to chew off their ears
you guessed that didn't work
then when the people of franksville realized that they
besides everybody loved john
john had started playing
who played the flute so badly that
before i tell you how rooster john got his name
the local scientist
cows in town started to make sour milk
but for some reason
suddenly a fly landed on a little girl
so there was a problem in the tow little town of franksville
you're quite good why don't you play that instead
the flies were annoying
then they decided to lower him down a well and let him play
but just try to imagine someone scratching a chalkboard with a fork
then two landed on everyone
but just then a man moved into town
begged to doctor wong
the people in the town decided to have a great parade in franksville and celebrate the fact that there was no water problem
i was born to do it i don't know why
oh no said police chief sanders just when things were going good for franksville
oh th
then other one landed on
thankfully someone was digging a hole and found water
then he said
he thought if he made a new mouthpiece especially shaped for john's mouth perhaps he could play the flute normally
i'm serious
it's the flute sound
and they didn't want to kick him out of town because they all had such nice teeth
he was very upset at first
i wrote you a song on the flute it's called cops and robbers
windows were breaking
but i have to play
the person next to me would be would have been very annoyed
the first time i ever took an airplane by myself it was fun and scary
then i could be a pilot too s pilot too since i'm much better at pushing buttons that you are pushing buttons than you are
she was the one who kept trying to give me peanuts
she told me to call her jennifer instead
she told me to be quiet and watch the movie
which made me have to go to the bathroom eight times i was glad that there wasn't anyone next to me
we are going to crash
imagine how hard it would be to work all those millions of buttons and eat peanuts
in even
you go higher and then any mountain higher than any mountain and you go faster than any car
by my backpack was in the overhead thing thingy
but sometimes people like to eat peanuts on their banana splits
i only used to only used the green crayon because it was the tallest and i wanted it to catch up to the red brown blue yellow purple and black ones
i also brought my deck of cards in case the pilot was bored and wanted to play go fish
grandpa laughed and told and took me straight to the ice cream shop
can't get past level three
uhm
i was flying there to see my grandfather and and we were going to the go we were going to go fishing
she said that she had to help other passengers
my mom gave me a coloring book and a cool looking dragons to keep me busy
he was ready really nice but he wouldn't play go fish with me
then jennifer came up to me and said she had a surprise i thought great i thought great more peanuts
when i got off the airplane there were was grandpa waiting for me he said how was your flight
the flight attendant gave me a deck of cards but she wouldn't play go fish with me
the way i figured it my game boy my game boy only was five buttons and i
then he told me that he once played the game i had on my game boy and he couldn't even pass level one
eventually the flight flight attendant seemed to get a little annoyed that i had to go to the bathroom so much
i guess it was because the plane was s so loud and i didn't know anyone
so i started yelling hey peanut lady hey peanut lady
one thing about being by yourself on an airplane is that the flight attendants are very nice to you
at first i thought wow look at all those buttons
i didn't know anyone at all all and had to go all the way from new york to texas without my parents
i told her that i wanted a banana split instead but she said they
but once the plane was in the car in the air i was pretty good
he laughed even though i was joking he said he thought i would make a great pilot someday if i wanted to be if i wanted to be
i played on my game boy until i got my new high score
i tried to watch the movie but i had already seen that one so it was boring
to ever stop but it doesn't but it does
the pilot told me that it wasn't really that hard once you practiced
i tried to push the button that lights up over my head so the flight attendant would come but guess what i was so short to reach the button
but to tell your the but to tell you the truth without my parents there i was pretty nervous
i told her that it was the peanuts that were making me so thirsty in the first place in the first place and that
it seemed like the plane in the plane is going
jennifer took me into the cockpit and there were a million buttons and levers and knobs and stuff
that's always scary
it was worth the whole trip just to eat a banana split with grandpa
i had a game boy in my backpack
i always thought flying was fun
they don't have any banana splits on the plane
she said the captain was inviting me to see the cockpit i thought awesome
a col i colored the dragon pictures all green so it didn't take very long
finally he landed
but it wasn't peanuts it was something really cool
i said someday i'm going to be a pilot and i'll only serve banana splits on my plane
but it was her fault
i said if you can't even get past level one and you're a pilot
she didn't like being called peanut lady but she didn't give me my game boy
i started thinking he might crash i didn't like to think about that but i couldn't help it
and that if she would get me a banana split i wouldn't i wouldn't have to go the bathroom so much
too fast
then i thought there's no way that anyone can remember to push all those buttons at the right time
i had seven coca col colas and four ginger ginger ales
that's when i missed my parents the most
the airplane ride
he was ex an excellent dentist but real love was music
before i tell you how the rooster john got his name you should know a little bit about the town franksville
but the town was filled with flies again
new town dentist
then on john would wake up at sunrise like a rooster and play to keep the flies away
well i'm sure you guessed that it didn't work so no one could hear anything
oh that's nice instrument but that's not the flute
the flute sounded normal and it turned out john could play it quite well
the bad flute player was rooster john he wasn't called rooster john yet
so there was nothing the police could do besides everybody loved john since he had become the town dentist everybody's teeth were much whiter and cleaner and no one had any cavities
the flies were annoying so he would swat them with his hand or even a f his new flute
we can't let you play with the flute anymore john said the police chief sanders
john thought he was ask an ok idea but the louder the echo that well made the flute sounded louder
john didn't know what to do so he kept playing his flute
doctor wong thought for a second then pronounced it's the flute sound the flies hate john's flute playing has much as we do
that's how the flute sounded when it when this guy played it
chief sanders i called it cops and robbers
however for some reason the way his mouth was shaped made his flute sound awful
the problem started when they ran out of water thankfully someone was digging a hole and found
lead a normal li life
oh no said the chief sanders just when things were going good for franksville
the flies would land all over the people they couldn't swat them off it was gross
doctor wong and john were stars of the parade
it was pretty soon there were tons of flies landing on everyone for they knew it
that came later he just new
because as bad as the flute sounded it was a lot better than thousands of flies crawling on them from
what would they do they couldn't keep john in jail and they couldn't want to kick him out of the town because they all had such nice teeth
he was very upset at first then he said oh well got good thing i brought my old flute back up
but i have to play i was born to do it i know why but i feel like i have to or else bad things will happen
then the flies stopped but just then a man moved into
though local dentist doctor wrong came up with an idea he taught he thought that if he made a new mouthpiece especially shaped for john's mouth then perhaps he could play the flute normally
maybe a poorly p played flute doesn't sound all that bad but just trying to image someone screaching an a chalkboard with a fork and then multiply that a hundred t times a hundred
he played musical instruments such as the guitar the tuba the piano and the clarinet
franksville was a town that seemed to have one problem after another
people were getting into cars car accidents and everybody looked really silly at dances dancing to music they couldn't hear they just couldn't
i even wrote a song
they had to cover their ears from the horrible sound
the people in franktown decided to have a great big parade in frankville so celebrated in fact for once there was no water problem no no fly problem and no flute problem
then suddenly a fly landed on a little girl then a fly landed on someone else then some landed on a bunch of people
so there was a problem in the t little town of franksville
it was then that people of franksville realized that they wouldn't have to take god good with them the bad
the neighbors are complaining and the cats and dogs are trying to chew off their ears
he started shaking the flute to get the flies off and accidentally smashed into pieces
windows were breaking and all the cows in the town started to make sour milk
they got tons and tons of flies
john the dentist was trying to driving the flies away
i'm serious still it's not a bad as bad as millions of flies i suppose
everyone cheered
then he played the song the police chief hated the sound so much that he threw john in jail but he couldn't keep john in jail since he was already breaking any laws
then they decided to lower him down a well let him play where there were no one could hear him
then suddenly the flies flew away as fast as they could
they were up in the main float as big band played as they marched up and down main street
so they decided that john could play the flute and everybody else would have to wear earplugs
look john i've heard you play the clarinet you qui you're quite good why don't you play the that instead the chief s said chief sanders
no no please don't play the old flute begged doctor wong
and guess what it worked doctor wong in the town hero
rooster john
town who played the flute so badly that people would run away screaming
but sometimes we don't always think all that great under pressure
it keeps hitting me on the shell and trying to roll me over and when you leave the room you
i would like to start by saying that i think that you are very mean to m make me do this because it wasn't even my fault
fine oscar can't really talk but if he could he would have said please shave the cat
dear mom don't let dad know that the real sh reason i shaved the cat was that he's always sneezing around
dear mom and dad jenny didn't brush her teeth last night
i swear that's the reason also i was going to sell the cat fur and buy my sister jenny braces for her big stupid face
but my stupid sister never taught her cat how to listen so she just ignored me
i i just didn't want to see the cat getting all hot and uncomfortable and stuff
instead the cat came into my room because jenny never plays with it enough
she's no good at school and you bought her a cat cause she's so responsible and stuff
you wouldn't always take the cat's side if you knew that if you knew the stuff he hid did to my poor turtle cat's aren't always nice just like my sister jenny isn't always nice
p s if you would have bought her a turtle i couldn't h have shaved it sincerely danny
i promise that i'll do a better job then i did on the cat cause now i have what dad calls life experience
ok here's what happened as i remember it
can i get a dog please so in conclusion i'm getting hungry and i'm sorry for shaving the cat although you can see that it's really jenny's fault for not being as responsible as you always say and not brushing her teeth
they just ran on that stupid wheel and didn't and did stupid things that's the last time i shave the cat to protect any stupid gerbils
so i thought that if i could shave the cat a lot of a lot of bunch of times her hair would grow back harder each time and soon she would have an in invincible coat of cat fur armor
and when you leave the room
i was afraid to tell you the real reason i shaved the cat was that i want to be a barber and i needed practice
it was an accident and i didn't even do it on purpose
so it really so it was really my father's day gift to him i couldn't buy him anything nice since you took away my allowance for when i shaved the neighbor's dog
i'll bet you didn't know something else did you know that i wanted to be a barber
if i had a cat i would teach it to not shave itself that's for sure
but so what if it's winter i mean it'll be summer soon enough and i just wanted that cat to get used to the idea before it got really hot
i think it really likes liked it its haircut the only reason it hasn't come out for two weeks is because you guys made such a big deal about it poor kitty this and poor kitty that it's your fault really
just cause she's a good student doesn't mean she's really responsible
i knew our cat would grow her fur back but some cats don't have hair
actually the t truth is that i by accident turned on the nose hair clippers and the cat was being chased by the turtle
so i grabbed dad's nose hair clippers and shaved it
dear mom and dad parents
and you know what those stupid gerbils didn't even thank me
she said that when we shave hair it grows back harder and sometimes even darker
i couldn't help it anyway
i know how much you hate him always sneezing and stuff so i thought if i get got rid of his fur he wouldn't sneeze and that you would have a better marriage
i think that she should brush her teeth twice tonight that's just my opinion though
plus i forgot to tell you that you should be blaming mrs casper my science teacher she made us shave something for science ask her
see she's s not so responsible after all
the cat liked being shaved anyway so i don't see the big deal
you guys will just probably say it's dinner danny cats it's winter danny cats don't overheat in winter
but the realest reason i i shaved the cat was to make a wig for those poor hair less cats that we saw on tv on the animal channel
i saw that the cat was trying to get the gerbils and you told us we couldn't hit animals so i didn't know what else to do
not that i shaved the cat though
plus if you weren't always cuddling with my sister so much maybe she would have been with her cat
besides the real reason i shaved the cat was to keep it nice and cool
then she would be a super cat and you could take her on tv shows and get lots of money so that you can send jenny to college even if she is a dumb little tattle'tale
you guys never liked oscar as much as the cat anyway
i really didn't mean to shave the cat really i swear
i was afraid you wouldn't let me practice on my own head can i practice by shaving jenny's head
how come jenny gets a cat and i get a stupid turtle anyway turtles don't do anything except poke their heads out and be not cuddly
i didn't have to get good grades to know that you shouldn't teach a cat to shave itself
dad please don't read the next part
plus oscar my turtle told me to shave the cat
last night i saw that she didn't brush her teeth oh yeah i forgot to tell you that
they are called hairless cats and they need fur in the winter sometimes i think
you should be proud of me for thinking so fast on my toes
ran right by the clippers and shaved herself i kept saying no kitty no don't shave yourself
since you have grounded me and told me to write down why i am sorry before i was allowed out of my room i am mad at you
oh sure it's easy to say that i should have picked just picked up the cat
this can also almost be cer this can almost certainly be accounted for by this strange almost magical effect that the pandas possess
no wait a second i don't understand
t'would be best to fly
the father watching this all through one eye
i think what the zoo needs is a great advertising campaign
proud of her daughter after all if it weren't for yin yin they would have had to move their yellow umbrella all she could say was nonsense
maggie figured that if she and three of her strongest magpie friends magpie friends
but i just learned how to make myself into a ball and roll two days ago and i've becoming very good at that i don't think that it will take that long to roll there said yin yin
no how many magpie's would it would be needed to fly a four hour i mean hundred pound panda bear and a one hundred pound bamboo rocket to the ship i mean rocketship to the moon said maggie the owl instantly instantly replied
and was in terrific shape but physical fitness was not the only reason that fred loved pandas
one day after fred had fed the pandas and was hugging the palm tree the zoo manager came up to him and said what is going on with your pandas fred i've never seen anything like it
the other reason that was was that anyone who gets within three feet of a panda automatically falls in love with them
why did the panda with the beautiful girl name yin yin have her name changed to the very un beautiful girl named columbus
well sir when columbus set out on his ship he was really trying to find a quicker way to get around europe in order to improve trade
for fred when it came to the pandas he had a warm spot in his heart
now while all this was going on what do you supposed fred was doing
so maggie flew to the owl and asked for advice
were to each grab hold of the corner of the rocketship they could all fly to the moon so they tried
she would be a very persuasive little bird when she wanted
fred was not allowed to actually hug the panda bears since that could be dangerous
this is just the type of exposure we needed those pandas will be with us for a long time
is a decidedly round about way to go if you must go
he didn't mind handling the raw meat he had to feed to the tigers
it's not that you aren't selling enough stuffed panda bears it's just that there haven't been enough people coming to see you in the first place
nonsense your job is to be cute so people want to run to the gift shop and buy panda bear dolls
they were in order of cuteness yin yin the young daughter poo poo the mother and moo man the gentle and always sleeping father
she said spitefully an instant later a young boy was heard saying ouch mom cut that out
her mother and father knew what they were talking about since they hadn't thought or talked of much else since yin yin said i want to go there and pointed to the moon
for he had always had at least one eye asleep at all times said
were to
and showed his support by taking a nap
oh well that makes sense then the man said the manager
at further distances pandas have a strange almost magical effect on human beings
it i would hate if you had to leave us after all it's the only home you know besides if you leave i'll get terribly out of shape now if you excuse me i need to squeeze something before i scream
fred fed the panda bears and the tigers and turtles
yes but what does that have to do with the pandas an man the zoo manager said the zoo manager well it seems to me sir that yin yin wanted to be a great explorer and instead became a business woman i see fred
it's not that we
there were three pandas and they were known as the pan family
how
i see your wings flapping but we don't seem to be going anywhere yin yin
a week later despite how much flapping they were still trying to get the rocket in the air
fred thought about fred thought about it and said you think we should rename yin yin columbus
it
yes the big one in the sky that is most likely not made of cheese and is most certainly not made of bamboo
no one could blame fred really since no one really wants to be eaten
hmm heavier than i thought i think we'll need more magpies maggie said maggie
back in the panda's home the mother panda poo poo was very
bamboo is very workable substance that pandas tend to handle bamboo a lot so this is in itself was not that astonishing at least to yin yin's parents fred sure was impressed though
which young lady helps pay for the bamboo that you eat
many people know that pandas eat bamboo a lot of it
nonsense said the mother i'm so mad i'm going to look at that lady over there and make her want to squeeze her son cheeks
but everything was not all bamboo and hugs at the zoo one morning fred was feeding yin yin and said oh yin yin i wish that more people could come to visit the zoo
where where discussing about going to the moon were discussing about going to the moon
fred was starting to feel the uncontrollable urge to hug the panda so before he ran off to hug the palm tree quickly said it costs so much to feed you panda bears i would hate
as for yin yin she was very proud to be renamed after a famous explorer and she and maggie never stopped trying to get to the moon
two hundred thousand and seventy six give or take two
yin yin's father moo man didn't think that it was very proper or wise for a young panda bear to go rolling off places where there wasn't any bamboo but he was supportive of his young daughter
it's taken me a couple of weeks to figure it out but i think yin yin wants to go to the moon and the magpies want to take her there said fred
it's a law of nature
it was fred's idea so let's begin with fred
he wanted to be a business man but instead became a great explorer
i know i shouldn't be telling you this but we might have to sell you and your family to the big zoo in san angeles if we don't get more money
actually it was an eight five point five degree spot on his left kidney but the point is that he was very fond of feeding the pandas
a little boy's cheeks have been made raw when their mother poo poo panda was upset
oh wise owl i have a question that i fear you only you can answer she said
one two three to the moon they all said together pulling with all their might
so all the other people at the zoo know would know that the pandas had just been fed when they saw fred hugging the rather un cuddly palm tree outside the panda's home
but his main objection was being eaten
but yin yin the young panda was not listening to fred she was talking to her best friend maggie the magpie about going to the moon
yin yin was always one to take good advice from her father and less than a week later yin yin and magpie magpie maggie had built a rocket ship out of bamboo
i think that the zoo needs
it's simple economics like it or not we are spokespeople for the panda stuffed animal industry
i'm sorry to say but many
t'would be best to ask the owl he closed his eye then closed eye
enough of this nonsense said yin yin's mother poo poo
a week later maggie named her managed to round up two hundred thousand and seventy eight magpie
but before he fell asleep he did manage to say i believe rolling is a decidedly
which makes us want to hug and squeeze things
the turtles weren't so bad but as for the tigers he wasn't so sure
but yin yin was the young
one more thing sir about those magpies flying above the pandas do you think that the zoo could purchase me a large sized umbrella
what sort of nonsense is this for a young panda bear going to the moon indeed
he was feeding the pandas like he was supposed to
the panda
so being eaten was definitely not something he looked forward t to each afternoon at three o'clock when it was time to feed the tigers
it turns out that the owl didn't take into consideration that once you get over one thousand magpie together they tend to fight and can't agree on a single thing
it is interesting to point out at this time that more stuffed panda bears are sold at zoo gift shops then all of the other stuff animals combined
the zoo keeper said good heavens man that is a great idea
yes but how many more yin yin said i'm not sure exactly said mag maggie
some people do not like to bite their finger nails but fred wasn't a nail biter
yin yin and her best friend magpie maggie the magpie who looked a lot like a panda would look if pandas were birds
the main obstacle it turns out was getting the rocketship off the ground
is i think that what the zoo needs
to turn your head all the way around without go without getting a terrible pain in your neck said owl
a lot of bamboo can get quite heavy so because of the pandas fred became very strong
such nonsense going to the moon said her mother poo poo
your job is to be cute so people won't to run to the gift shop and buy panda bear dolls
the main obstacle it turns out was getting the rocket ship off the ground
i know i shouldn't be telling you this but we might have to sell you and your family to the big zoo in san angeles
but he was supportive of his young daughter and showed his support by taking a nap
why he was feeding pandas like he was supposed to do
the other reason was that anyone who gets within three feet of the panda automatically falls in love with them
why did a panda with a beautiful girl name yin yin have her name changed to the b to the very un beautiful girl name columbus
it's a law of nature
but the point is that he was very fond of feeding the pandas
back in the panda's home the mother panda poo poo was very proud of her daughter
the zoo keeper said good heavens man that is a great idea no wait a second i understand

like it or not we are spokespeople for the pandas stuffed animals industry which young lady helps pay for the bamboo that you eat
the owl instantly instantly replied two hundred thousand and seventy six give or take two
what is going on with your pandas fred i've never seen anything like it
yin yin and her best friend maggie and the magpie who looked a lot like a panda would look if pandas were birds
fred fed the panda bears the tigers and the turtles
he wanted to be a business man but instead became a great explorer
fred was not allowed to actually hug the panda bears since that could be dangerous
they were in order of cuteness yin yin the young daughter poo poo and mother and moo man the gentle and always sleepy father
but later when fred walked into the panda's h home under a a his new yellow umbrella all she could think to say was nonsense
i think that the zoo needs its a great adventure campaign
a week later despite much flapping they were still trying and to get out the rocket in the air
this is just the type of exposure we needed those pandas will be with us for a long time

one more thing sir about those magpies flying above the pandas do you think that the zoo could purchase me a large sized umbrella
in terrific shape
yes but how many more yin yin said i'm not exactly sure replied maggie
now if you excuse me i need to squeeze something before i scream
no how many magpies would be needed to fly a four hundred pound panda bear and a one hundred pound bamboo rocket ship to the moon said maggie
it's simple economics
if we don't get more money it's not that you aren't selling enough stuffed panda bears
maggie figured that if she had three of her strongest magpie friends were to each grab hold of the corner of the rocket ship they could all fly to the moon
so one day after fred had fed the pandas and was hugging the palm tree the zoo manager came up to him and said

there were three pandas and they were known as the pan family
after all it weren't if it weren't for yin yin they would have had to move from their wonderful home
it's just that they haven't been enough people coming to see you in the first place
she could be a very persuasive little bird when she wanted
i see your wings flapping but we don't see seem to be going anywhere said yin yin
did you know that since the little panda built that bamboo rocket ship and those magpies started fluttering about that the zoo's profits has gone up f four thousand percent
then closed his eye
no one could blame fred really since no one really wants to be eaten
i want to go there and pointed to the moon
this can almost certainly be accounted for by this strange almost magical effect that the panda possess possess
i see fred
yin yin was always one to take good advice from her father and less than a week later yin yin and maggie had built a rocket ship out of bamboo
yin yin's father moo man
after all it's only home you know besides if you leave i'll get terribly out of shape
hmm heavier than i thought i think we will need some magpies said maggie
such nonsense going to the moon said her mother poo poo
so they tried one two three to the moon they said together pulling in their might
it's taken me a couple of weeks to figure it out but i think yin yin wants to go to the moon and the magpies want to take her there said fred
nonsense said the mother i'm so mad i'm going to look at the lady over there and make her want to squeeze her son cheeks she said spitefully

as for yin she was very proud to be renamed after a famous explorer and she and maggie never stopped trying to get to the moon
fred was starting to feel the uncomfortable urge to hug the panda
the panda
well sir
for fred when it came to the pandas he had a warm spot in his heart actually it was a eighty five point five degree spot on his left kidney
it turns out that the owl didn't take into consideration that once you get over one thousand magpie together they tend to fight and can't agree on one single thing
fred thought about it and said you know i think we should rename yin yin columbus
how to turn your head all the way around without getting a terrible pain in your neck said owl
each afternoon at three o'clock when it was time to feed the tigers
what sort of nonsense is this for a young panda bear going to the moon indeed nonsense
one morning fred was feeding yin yin and said oh yin yin i wish that more people would come to visit the zoo
the zoo manager laughed and walked away but didn't purchase a fashionable yellow umbrella for fred the next day
at least to yin yins parents freds sure was impressed though
now while all this was going on what do you supposed fred was doing
but physical fitness was not the only reason that fred loved the panda
didn't think it was very proper or wise for a young panda bear to go rolling off to places where there wasn't any bamboo
but yin yin the young panda was not listening to fred she was talking to her best friend maggie and magpie about going to the moon
the father watching this all through one eye
and he hung up can't fool me she said hmm something will have to be done and she went to her closet
mister blandsworth was about to show the class his collection of ball points pens from all over the world when someone came to the door slowly the doll d the knob turned
the class did as it was told the big kid from three oh nine was certainly right miss swamp was a real

while dusting erasers in the schoolyard three of the ringleaders of three oh seven discussed

but recess it was another story wow said the kids while miss nelson is away we can really act up
afterward they went to lulu's where they stuffed themselves silly
miss nelson's kids were agreeing an agreeable
at the stroke of ten the kids from two oh seven
a tall lumpy miss nelson tottered into the room mister blandsworth was surprised you're sooner than we expected he said
school they passed miss nelson's class i mean house
on monday morning miss nelson's kids were all in their seats they were v were very nervous some of them had not slept well all weekend
the tall and lumpy nelson miss nelson didn't speak er said the kids her throat must still be sore

and they practiced very some very difficult stunt work in the back yard
miss swamp is the meanest substitute in the whole world said the big kid nobody acts up when she's around

hot dogs cried the kids we glad to see you
miss nelson telephoned mister blandsworth to see what was going on you're not miss nelson said blandsworth miss nelson is back
mister blandsworth
was not a lot of fun all morning blandsworth tried to amuse the class with his corny
and he left the room
that's right said miss swamp and i'm here to whip this class into shape get back to those desks on the double
silly but soon they made a serious mistake
and said she had a surprise
without my parents there i was pretty nervous
three
i don't
at pushing buttons than you are
about being by yourself on an airplane is that the flight attendants are very nice to you
has five buttons and i can't get past
there was grandpa waiting for me
i only used the green crayon because it was the tallest and i wanted
to be quiet and watch the movie i tried to watch the movie but i had already seen that one so it was boring
finally we landed
but it was her fault
it wasn't really that hard once you practiced
i
it was worth the whole trip just to eat a banana split with grandpa
i didn't like to think about that but
and he couldn't even pass level one
but sometimes people like to eat
i didn't know anyone at all and had to go all the way
to ever stop
to help other passengers
go fish
and eat peanuts and go to the bathroom
i was glad that there wasn't anyone next to me
you go higher than any mountain and you go faster than any car
it was too short to reach the button
and i'll only serve banana splits on my plane
she s said that she had
she said they don't have any banana splits on a
brown blue yellow
it was fun and scary
bored and wanted to play
imagine how hard it would be to work
i always i've always thought flying was fun
i told her that it was the peanuts that were making me so thirsty
he laughed
flight attendant would come
and
the flight attendant gave me a deck of cards but she wouldn't play go fish with me
that's always scary because it seems like even though we are
but i told her that i would like a banana split instead
i couldn't help it
inviting me to see the cockpit
peanuts on their banana splits
i said if you can't get past level one and you can be a pilot then i
i had a game boy in my backpack
pictures all green so it didn't take very long
jennifer took me into the cockpit and there were like a million buttons and
so
took me straight to the
but you
she told me to call her jennifer instead
but to tell you the truth
then jennifer ga
then he told me that
i thought great more peanuts
i guess it was because the plane was so loud and i didn't know anyone
by myself
suddenly i thought wow look at all those buttons
it to catch up to the red
i also brought my deck of cards in case the pilot was
once the plane was in the air i was pretty good
level three
i had seven cola's and four ginger ale's
i tried to push the button that lights up so the
he said how was your flight
started yelling hey peanut lady hey peanut lady
for some reasons she kept trying to give me peanuts
it was something really cool she said the captain was
but it did
from new york to texas without my parents
we are going to crash
one thing
get me a banana split i wouldn't have to go the bathroom so much
said he thought i would make a great pilot someday if i w wanted to be
i colored the dragon
grandpa laughed and then
the pilot told me
the person next to me would have been very annoyed
i was too short to reach the button
get me my game boy
i was going there to see my grandfather
the airplane ride
i played on my game boy until i got my new high score
he once played the game i had on my game boy
the plane
but it wasn't peanuts
i started thinking we might crash
that the plane is going too fast
then i thought there's no way that anyone can remember to push all those buttons at the right time
purple and black ones
even though i wasn't joking he
in the first place and that if she would
my mom gave me a coloring book of cool looking dragons to keep me busy
all those millions of buttons
which made me have to go to the bathroom eight times
but guess what
and i said someday i'm going to be a pilot
on the ground
she didn't like being called peanut lady but she did
could be a pilot too since i'm much better
my backpack was in the overhead thingy
when i got off the airplane
being
the way i figured it my game boy only
she told me
he was really nice but he wouldn't play go fish with me
ice cream shop
even the flight attendant seemed a little annoyed that i had to go to the bathroom so much
that it was
i thought awesome
that's when i missed my parents the most
we were going to go fishing
the first time i ever took an airplane ride
levers and knobs and stuff
came up to me
then a fly landed on someone else then some landed on a bunch of people then pretty soon tons of flies were landing on everyone
windows were breaking and all the cows in town started to make sour milk
when the townsfolk heard the noise they couldn't even swat at the flies anymore
i have to play i was born to do it
the local d scientist doctor wong came up with an idea
their problems started when they ran out of water
so there was a problem in the little town of franksville
he wasn't called rooster john yet that came later
i even even wrote you a song chief sanders it's called cops and robbers
it was then that the people of franksville realized that they would have to take the good with the bad
doctor wong and john were all the stars of the parade
maybe a poorly played flute doesn't sound all that bad
no one could hear anything people were getting into car accidents and everybody looked really silly at dances dancing to music they couldn't hear
he started shaking the flute to get the flies off and accidentally smashed it into pieces
the flies would land all over the people and they couldn't swat at them it was gross then suddenly the flies flew away fast as they could
look john i've heard you play the clarinet you're quite good why don't you play that instead said chief sanders
doctor wong thought for a second then pronounced it's the flute sound the flies hate john's flute playing as much as we do
then the town decided to have a great big parade in franksville
they got tons and tons of flies then the flies stopped
so they decided that john could play the flute and everybody else would have to wear earplugs
john didn't know what to do so he just kept on playing his flute
he played many musical instruments such as the guitar the tuba the piano and the clarinet
but
before i tell you how rooster john got his name you should know a little bit about the t town of franksville
still it's not as bad as millions of flies i suppose
the police chief hated the sound so much that he threw john in jail
from then on john would wake up at sunrise like a rooster and play to keep the flies away
a big band band played as they marched up and down main street everyone cheered
then they decided to lower him down into a well and let him play down where no one could hear him
no no please don't play your old flute begged doctor wong
the neighbors are complaining and the cats and dogs are trying to chew off their ears
before they knew it the town was filled with flies again
they had to cover their ears from the horrible sound
i don't know why but i feel like i have to do to or else bad things will happen
thankfully someone was digging a hole and found water but soon after that they started to get flies
he thought that if he made a new mouthpiece especially shaped for john's mouth
what should they do they shouldn't keep john in jail and they didn't want to kick him out of town because they all had such nice teeth
oh no said chief sanders just when things were going good for franksville
rooster john
that's how the flute sounded when this guy played it i'm serious
because as bad as the flute sounded it was a lot better than thousands of flies crawling on them
then he played the song
but just try to imagine someone scratching on a chalkboard with a fork and then multiply that times a hundred
they were up in on the main float
they just couldn't lead a normal life
we can't let you play that flute anymore john said police chief sanders
he was very upset at first then he said oh well good thing i bought brought my old flute as as back up
john the dentist is driving the flies away
oh why that's a nice instrument but it's just not the flute
but just then a man moved into town who played the flute so badly that people would run away screaming
to celebrate the fact that for once there was no water problem no fly problem and no fruit flute problem
well i'm sure you guessed that didn't work
however for some reason the way his mouth was shaped made his flute sound awful
the flies were annoying so he would swat at them with his hand or even his new flute
franksville was a town that seemed to have one problem after the other
besides everybody loved john since he had become the town dentist everybody's teeth were much whiter and cleaner and no one had any cavities
the bad flute player was rooster john
but they couldn't keep john in jail since he wasn't really breaking any laws so there was nothing the police could do
then suddenly a fly landed on a little girl
john thought that was an ok idea but there was an echo in the well that made his flute sound louder
but it was too late john had started playing
down down batman sunk i'm finished he thought there's no way to escape but just before batman's head disappeared below the sand a green glove hand reached for him
but batman would soon need help in another part of town criminal genius called a riddler a riddler was also plotting against him
he discovered an underground c t cavern filled with crime fighting equipment dick couldn't believe his eyes he was inside the batcave
yeah
moments later he tu he returned as batman two face smiled be begin pa pass two he whispered to his gang then he ran out to the street and jumped into a nearby moblie batman followed him
easy money the hoods sneer sneered as they kept up alongside her they snatched her p purse and ran but an instant later a car came into a screeching halt in front of them
batman and robin and said batman i like the sound of that from then on batman and robin would be partners tracking down two face and the riddler and every other criminal in gotham city
it was dick he had followed batman
when he wasn't fighting crime batman had a secret identity he was bruce whale the wealthiest man in the in gotham city
al all right folks this is an old fashioned stick up two face gr growled at the ter terrified guests his gang members were so busy robbing everyone they didn't notice bruce wayne slip out of the room
the hoodlums knew they were no match for batman but when the top of the batmobile opened they were surprised to see a young man
batman was the greatest crime fighter in the gotham city whenever crimes tried to break the law batman was there to stop them
dick lived dick liked living in the in the mansion but he wo but he wondered where bruce went every evening late one night dick went searching for a clue
aren't you glad i didn't listen dick answered i think it's time to become partners since i just saved your life
the manhole led into an an abandoned subway tunnel in the dim night in the dim light batman could see someone coming toward him it was two face carrying some kind of weapon
okay partner we have a deal two face said what's the plan
i expect you'll be burned alive two face said as batman sank deeper i'd love to stay and see you off but crime's a wastin' and i'm a very busy man then two face walked away
dick smiled my folks used to say i flew like a bird on the flying trapeze so they'll called me robin
you were on my trail two face snarled but it was a but it was all a trap two face pointed his weapon at batman and fired
with his last ounce of strength batman grabbed the the hand it an instant later he felt himself being yanked up and out of the pit
but dick quickly proved them wrong he had spent years training as an acrobat he leaped and
the following night two face arrived at the party right on schedule
two face two face was one of the criminals batman had not caught yet two face and his gang committed crimes all over gotham city they worked so quickly no one could keep up with them batman was only one man to stop two face he w he would need help
while the riddler had the brains to with outwit the batman he didn't have the muscle to
two two face's weapon sent a fireball hurtling
and there was the batmobile it could only mean one thing bruce wayne was batman
you'll be okay now dick told the woman an then
after later batman said i told you no crime fighting
wealthy manor
the riddler tacked down two face and made an offer two face decided to flip a coin if it comes up heads we'll join forces he com he explained the coin hit the ground landing heads up
meanwhile the explosion fireball shattered the turning the tunnel walls stone and steel began to rain on batman and he was ground beneath his feet collasped collapsed batman felt h himself sinking
it was no ordinary car it was the batmobile oh no one of the hoods screamed it's batman
dived about kicking and punching the stunned thugs in no time he had knocked them out all out
after
muscle to finish him off the riddler decided that two face would make a perfect partner in crime
sent ball hurtling toward batman acting quickly batman pressed a button on his utility jet instantly his costume was covered with a fire proof coating the ball of flame hit him full blast but batman was protected
meanwhile across town a gang of thugs had spotted a woman walking down the lonely street of gotham city
look one of the cooks shouted crooks shouted it isn't batman it's just a kid we can take him easy
you're too young batman answered besides batman fights alone
he discovered a secret door that led to the to a f flight of stairs dick followed the st followed the stairs down into the darkness
a hand grabbed him and tossed him to the batmobile it was batman and he was angry why can't we fight crime together dick asked batman and as they drove back to the w wa wayne manor
okay batman said you you've earned it but what are we going to call you
you thought you
tomorrow all of gotham's richest people will be at a big party the riddler explained you'll crash the party and rob the guests when batman arrives you'll s to stop you he'll walk right into out trap
by now all the turtles were usually way ahead of mud but this time swish was just as slow
since it would have to take him months to get to the great pond by himself
the mayor of great pond mrs tort posted the rules of the race on a tree for everyone to see
swish started yawning
swish's mother smiled and said i know that you can win swish but it's an honor just to get to race said swish mother
all the turtles in blue pond held a meeting to d to discuss the problem
the turtles all stretched and thought really thought really slow thoughts
when all the turtles arrived there w was a seven day festival called the shell dwellers festival
the mayor doctor softshell said this is ridiculous swish has to race he's the slowest turtle i've every seen except for mud of course
swish took the cup that d cup that day for the first time
but as he got a little older the turtles began to realize that swish was really really really slow
swish was sad that he lost but all the turtles from blue pond cheered for swish
this was the most famous turtle there was
mud didn't answer in fact mud was sound asleep
even i was faster than you when i was your age you're cheating you're going to ruin the great race forever
he put the earplugs in his ears and he could hear mud's singing any he couldn't hear mud singing anymore
all the turtles were very very slow so it took them time before anyone could figure out which turtle were the slowest
after a few hours most of the turtles have or had gone a few feet all except two
the winner of the great turtle race was so important that he or she didn't have to move for four years until the next festival
but though he became the greatest and the biggest turtle all much greater or bigger than mud
we never thought of that they all they s they all said
she announced well mud it looks like you've done it again sludge pond wins the turtle cup again
so with swish they thought maybe just maybe he could bring back the turtle cup to their their little pond
swishes father said son i have something to tell you
it was rumored he was so slow his heart would only beat once a day
you'll you'll get to meet all sorts of new turtles
the real winner is swish softbelly of blue pond the crowd went wild
he thought sure they are nice to me but because they think i can win the race but if i lose they'll be disappointed and mad at me
rule number four do no turtle may fall asleep since if you are asleep you aren't running as fast as you can
who was this who is this young punk he thought to himself
rule number two all turtles must run as fast as they can and the turtles that that is closest to the starting line wins
then he snapped out of it and remembered his fathers father had warned him of his tricks
how come they don't move that big rock out of the field it seems to be everyone's way said swish
they looked at the horizon and saw the sun was starting uhm starting the rise
turtles could catch up with friends they had not seen since the last festival
it was because of swish that blue pond became the most respected pond in the land
but he doesn't want to be treated special he just wants to be normal and he doesn't want everybody to hate him if he can't beat mud
swish was h was happy too but deep down inside he knew he was just as slow as mud
blue pond was a nice village located about three days crawl from the great pond
that's not a rock sweetie his mother said that's mud
he was the biggest most respected and also one of the trickiest turtles there was
ladies and gentlemen she said mud mud from sludge pond has been disqualified for sleeping during the race
this was the kind of thing that swish would get all the time
every four years turtles from all over the land would crawl to the great pond
the turtle's name swish
oh no shouted the fans mud's winning it looks like mud is still the greatest turtle of them all
the turtle cup was the trophy that the winner would take home to their village
the crowd started yelling speech speech
the crowd thought he had he must have realized that his singing trick wasn't working
it looked as if neither of them had moved at all they were both moving of course but they were so slow that it was hard to tell
like like a turtle with honor
when the time of the festival drew near all the turtles in the land started toward great pond
what would you like to say to all the turtles at the festival
for example mister peeks the local shell cleaner would say hey there swish do you want a free shell waxing today
then he whispered in swish's ear all the tricks that his great great grand turtle taught him
when mud was in his prime there was a new turtle born in blue pond
turtles never cheat and i'm a turtle with honor
he told his mother you know what i'm going to win this race i know it and all these and all these turtles will know that blue pond rules
she said swish you are the youngest winner of the great turtle race that was the most exciting finish we've ever had
i heard once it took him three days just to yawn
the slowest turtles from each pond were carried to the starting line by members of their village
finally after the long journey all the turtles arrived at great pond
mud knew that this would be his closest race ever and he was actually getting a little bit scared
they read rule number one the great race begins at sunrise and ends at sunset
swish saw a rock in the middle of the field and wondered
he was tired from racing and thought he it would be nice to just listen to mud's sweet voice and fall asleep
as they did this as they did the sky turned from black to dark blue
he he would take it many more times after that
without him we don't have a chance
where there there was lots of e eating and laughing
once his mother called him in for dinner and he t and didn't make it home until breakfast the next morning and he was only a foot away
they were very proud he gave mud such a close race
mister peeks would never do anything for free but he was g going to give swish a free shell waxing
mud had actually sung himself to sleep
the slowest t turtle
but then right at the end right before the sunset swish started to pull ahead of mud
so you so you can see winning the great race is a great honor
but swish d didn't let mud scare him
mud kept singing his lullaby for a few hours but he stopped right before sunset
he always thought sure that no one treated him special and that he treated everybody like he wanted to be treated
the town agreed to treat swish like a normal turtle and after a while swish decided that he would be proud to race for his village
swish and mud were both back at the starting line
the the least a turtle moves the bigger they get and the longer they live
as you know your great great grand turtle raced mud once he wasn't as slow as you but he did teach me about mud's dirty tricks
this time it was a bit closer than you would have liked i'll bet
everyone treated swish differently
wish was suddenly very excited
you're just trying to to make me quit i'm not going to fall for your tricks he said
swish read the r rules even though he knew them by heart then he heard the mayor say runner's take please take your positions
mrs tort went up to swish and gave him the turtle cup
i would never promised that i would win the race i can't beat mud anyway
mud said to swish there's no way that a turtle as young as you can be so slow
rule number three no turtle may pretend to be going fast but go slow instead all turtle must go as fast as they can at all times
he reached his shell and pulled out a couple of earplugs
just then the mayor said ready set slow and off they went
he would never lose the turtle cup for the rest of his life
you have to remember that even though he's gifted at being slow he's still very young said swish swish father
everything about the festival was fun but the main event was the great turtle race
swish made a loud gulp sound just do your best said his moth mom
the mayor of pondland went to present the turtle cup to sludge pond again
they all felt a little sad because they hadn't held the turtle cup in over a seven hundred years
look there's your cousin peek a boo from 'big puddles' village said swish mother swish mother
there were there were many legends about him
since turtles never cheat this is the most important rule to break this rule would mean an end to the great turtle race forever
this means that we have a news champion
all the extra attention made swish very uncomfortable
for the first time in six hundred years i would like to present the turtle cup to blue pond the crowd went wild again
it would take some turtles from far away village two two whole weeks just to get there
when swish was born everyone thought he was a slow t little slow
then the sun went down mud was the closest turtle to the starting line
it had been in sludge pond for over fifty years because no one could ever beat their turtle
mrs snapper would say hi hi swishy do you want some yummy pie to fill you up and s and slow you down for the big race a fat turtle is a slow turtle
mud didn't answer the mayor tapped mud on the shell and said hello hello mud
swish had a had to be carried on his father's back
after six hours mud and swish were still ti ti tied and had only moved a few inches
after seven days of playing and dancing and bug eating finally the day of the race came
we all want you to look good when you bring home the cup
i'm not afraid of stupid mud mud
then mud tried another trick he started singing a soft beautiful lullaby
there were about three hundred turtles racing they were all the s all the slowest of the slow
i think that you'll be the greatest champion for many years since turtles only get slower with age
so one day he told his parents i don't want to race
then flies were annoying the flies were annoying so he would swat them all with his hands or even his new flute
then they decided to lower him down a well and let him play down where no one could hear him
john's dentist was driving the flies away
doctor wong and john were the stars of the parade they were up in the main float
the bad flute player was rooster john he wasn't called rooster john yet that came later
so there was a problem in the little town of franksville
oh that's a nice instrument but it just not the flute i even wrote you a song chief sanders it's called cops and robbers
john thought that was that was an ok idea but there was an echo in the well that made the flute sound louder
their problems started when they ran out of water
oh no cried chief cherub
no one could hear anything people were getting into car accidents and everybody looked really silly at dances dancing to music they couldn't hear
and guess what it worked doctor wong was the town hero the flute sounded normal and it turned out john could play it quite well
he was very upset at first then he said oh well good thing i brought my old flute as back up
because as bad as the flute sounded it was a lot better than thousands of flies crawling on them
he played many musical instruments such as the guitar the tuba the piano and the clarinet
then a fly landed on someone else
so they decided that john could play the flute and everybody else would have to wear earplugs
no no please don't play your old flute begged doctor wong but it was too late john had started playing
the local dentist doctor wong came up with an idea
that's how the flute sounded when this guy played it i'm serious
but i have to play i was born to do it i don't know why but i feel like i have to or else bad things will happen
before i tell you how rooster john got his name you should know a little bit about the town of franksville
the neighbors are complaining and the cats and dogs are trying to chew off their ears
uhm oh no said chief sanders just when things were go going good for franksville
but they couldn't keep john in jail since he wasn't really breaking any laws
the flies would land all over the people and they couldn't swat them off it was gross then suddenly the flies flew away fast as they could
he started shaking the flute to get the flies off and accidentally smashed it into pieces
it was then that people of franksville realized that they would have to take a good with take the good with the bad
a big band played as they marched up and down main street everyone cheered
then suddenly a fly landed on the a little girl
he was the new town dentist he was an excellent dentist but his real love was music
what should they do they couldn't keep john in jail and they didn't want to kick him out of the of town because they all had such nice teeth
then he played the song the police ch ch ch che uh
thankfully someone was digging a hole and found water but soon after they started to get flies
windows were breaking all the cows in town started to make sour milk
maybe a poorly played flute doesn't sound at all that bad but just try to imagine someone scratching a chalkboard with a fork and then multiplying that times a hundred
rooster john
we can't let you play the flute anymore john said police sheriff sanders
they just couldn't
they had to cover their ears from the horrible sound
the police chief hated the sound so much that he threw john in jail
then the flies stopped but just then a man moved into town who played the flute so badly that people would run away screaming
the people in town decided to have a great big parade in franksville and celebrate the fact that for no
from then on john would wake up at sunrise like a rooster and play to keep h the flies away
then some landed on a bunch of people and pretty soon tons of flies were landing on everyone but before they knew it the town was filled with flies again
however for some reason the way his mouth was shaped made his flute sound awful
well i'm sure you guessed that didn't work
when the townsfolk heard the noise they couldn't even swat the flies anymore
uhm
they got tons and tons of flies
he thought that if he made a new mouthpiece especially shaped for john's mouth then perhaps he could play the flute normally
still it's not as bad as millions of flies i suppose
besides everybody loved john since he had become the town dentist everybody's teeth were much whiter and cleaner and no one had any cavities
look john i've heard you play the clarinet you're quite good why don't you play that instead said chief sander sanders
franksville was a town that seemed to have one problem after the other
john didn't know what to do so he just kept on playing his flute
lead a normal life
doctor wong thought for a second then pronounced it's the flute sound the flies hate john's flute playing as much as we do
so there was nothing the police could do
for once there was no water problem no fly fly problem and no flute problem
how to turn your head all the way around with getting a terrible pain in your neck said owl
yes but what does that have to do with the pandas man said the zoo pe zoo keeper well it seems to me sir that yin yin wanted to be a great explorer and instead became a business woman
but after he fell asleep he did manage to say i believe rolling is a decidedly round about way to go if you must go it it it t'would be the best to fly
it is interesting to point out at this time that more s stuffed panda bears are sold at zoo gift shops then all of the other stuff animals combined
he didn't mind handling the raw meat he had to feed to the tigers his main objection was to being eaten
the owl instantly replied two hundred thousand and seventy six give or take two a week later maggie managed to round up two hundred thousand and seventy eight magpies she could be a very persuasive little bird when she wanted
besides if you leave i'll get terribly out of shape now if you excuse me i need to squeeze something before i can scream but yin yin and the young panda was not listening to fred
one two three to the moon they all they said together pulling with all their might i see your wings flapping but we don't seem to be going anywhere said yin yin
i know i shouldn't be telling you this but we might have to sell you and your family to the big zoo in san angeles if we don't get more money
there were three pandas and they were known as the pan family they were in order of cuteness yin yin the young daughter poo poo the mother and moo man the gentle and always sleepy father
it's taken me a couple of weeks to figure it out but i think yin yin wants to go to the moon and magpies want to take her said fred
enough of this nonsense said yin yin's mother poo poo what sort of nonsense is this for a young panda bear
yin yin was always one to take good advice from her father and less than a week later yin yin and maggie had built a rocket ship out of bamboo bamboo is very workable substance and pandas tend to handle bamboo a lot so that so that this in itself was not that astonishing at least to the yin yins parents fred sure was impressed though
but everything was not all bamboo and hugs at the zoo
back in the panda's home the mother panda poo poo was very proud of her daughter after all if it weren't for yin yin they would have to move th they would have they would have had to move their wonderful home but later when fred walked into the panda's home under his new yellow umbrella all she could think to say was nonsense
some people do like to bite their finger nails but fred wasn't a nail biter so being eaten was definitely not something he looked forward to each afternoon at three o'clock when it was time to feed the tigers
now while all this was going on what do you supposed fred was doing
yin yin and her best friend maggie the magpie who looked a lot like a panda would look if pandas were birds were discussing about going to the moon
it was a law of nature in further distances pandas have a strange almost magical effect on human beings which makes us want to hug and squeeze things
why did a panda with the beautiful girl name yin yin have her name changed to the very un beautiful girl name columbus
said it costs so much to feed your pa panda bears i would hate if you had to leave us after all it's only the home you know
the father watching this all through one eye for he always had at least one eye asleep at all times said t'would be the best to ask the owl then closed his eye
fred was starting to feel the uncontrollable urge to hug the panda so before he ran off to hug the palm tree quickly
fred thought about it and said you know i think we should rename yin yin columbus the zoo keeper said good heavens man that is a great idea no wait a second i don't understand well sir
it's simple economics like like it we're not we are spokespeople for the panda stuffed animal industry which young lady helps pay for the bamboo b that you eat such nonsense going to the moon said her mother poo poo
i see fred one more one more thing sir about those magpies flying above the pandas do you think that the zoo could purchase me a large sized umbrella
nonsense said the mother i'm so mad i'm going to look at that lady over there and make her want to squeeze her son cheeks he said spitefully an instant later a young boy was heard saying ouch mom cut that out i'm sorry to say but many a little boy's cheeks have been made raw when mother poo poo panda was upset
the zoo manager laughed and walked away but did purchase a fashionable yellow umbrella for fred the next day
this can almost certainly be accounted for by this strange almost magical effect that the pandas possess
a week later despite much flapping they were still trying and to get the rocket in the air it turns out that the owl didn't take into consideration that once you get over one thousand magpie together they tend to fight and can't agree on a single thing
no one could blame fred really since no one really wants to be eaten
fred she was talking to her best friend maggie the magpie about going to the moon yes the big one in the sky that is most likely not made of cheese and most certainly not made of bamboo
but physical fitness was not the only reason that fred loved the pandas the other reason was that anyone who gets within three feet of a panda automatically falls in love with them
the panda
hmm heavier than i thought i think we will need more magpies said maggie yes but how many more yin yin said i'm not sure exactly replied maggie
it's not that you aren't selling enough stuffed panda bears it's just that there haven't been enough people coming to see you in the first place i think what zoos needs is a great advertising campaign
oh well that makes sense then said the manager did you know that since the little panda built that bamboo rocket ship and those magpie's started fluttering about that the zoo's profits have gone up four gone up four thousand percent this is just the type of exposure we needed those pandas will be with us for a long time
many people know that pandas eat bamboo a lot of it a lot of bamboo can get can get quite heavy so because of the pandas fred became very strong and was in terrific shape
going to the moon indeed nonsense your job is to be cute so people want to run off to the gift shop and to buy panda bear dolls
as for yin yin she was very proud to be renamed after a famous explorer and she and maggie never stopped trying to get to the moon
one morning fred was feeding yin yin and said oh yin yin i wish that more people would come to visit the zoo
while why he was feeding the pandas like he was supposed to so one day after so one day after fred had fed the pandas and was hugging the palm tree the zoo manager came up to him and said what is going on with your pandas with your pandas fred i've never seen anything like it
for fred when it came to the pandas he had a warm spot in his heart actually feeding the pandas wait uh actually it was eighty five point degree spot on his left kidney but the point is that he was very fond of feeding the pandas
her mother and father knew what they were talking about since they hadn't thought or talked much of of else since yin yin said i want to go there and pointed to the moon
yin yin's father moo man didn't think it was very proper or wise for a young panda bear to go rolling off to places where there wasn't any bamboo but she was supportive of his young daughter and showed his support by taking a nap
fred was not allowed to actually hug the panda bears since that he could be dangerous so all the other people at the zoo would know that the pandas had just been fed when they saw fred hugging the rather un cuddly palm tree outside of the panda's home
it was fred's idea so let's begin with fred fred fed the panda bears the tigers and turtles the turtles weren't so bad but as for the tigers he wasn't so sure
so maggie flew to the owl and asked for his advice oh wise owl i have a question that i fear only you can answer she said
when when columbus set out on his ship he was really trying to find a quicker way to get to get to get around europe in order to improve trade he wanted to be a business man but instead became a great explorer
but i just learned how to make myself into a ball and roll two days ago and i've becoming very good at it i don't think it will take that long to roll there said yin yin
it was gross then suddenly the flies flew away fast as they could
then two landed on everyone
to celebrate the that for once there was no
but i have to play i was born to do it
and accidentally smashed it into pieces
for john's mouth then perhaps he could play the flute normally
said police
the bad
and guess what it worked
they got tons and tons of flies
he was the new town dentist he was a very excellent
an echo in the well that made the flute sound louder
maybe a poorly played flute doesn't sound all that bad
uhm and everybody else would have to wear earplugs
the flies hate john's flute playing as much as we do john d
my old flute
come to to be the town's
the flies were annoying so he co
the flies would land all over the people
he wasn't called rooster john yet
then
the people in t
we can't let you play the flute anymore john said the poli
but just then a man moved in tow
the local scientist doctor wong came up with an idea
it was a lot better than thousands of flies cla crawling on them
he played ma
they ran out of water thankfully someone was digging a hole and found water
the
a big band played as they marched
bad things will happen
no one could hear anything
then pronounced it's the flute sound
pretty then pretty soon tons of flies were landing on everyone
besides everybody loved john
chief sanders
when the townsfolks heard the noise they
bad flute player was rooster john
landed on a little girl then another one on a big girl
the flute sounded normal and it turned out that john could play qui
that his fish would jump at of their fish bowl
then the flies stopped
started to make sour milk
because as the bad as
dentist but his real love was music
i have to or else
well i'm sure you guessed that didn't work
at dances dancing to music th
soon after they started getting flies
so they decided that john could play the flute
they couldn't keep john in jail
one landed on everyone
on the flute it's called cops and robbers
the neighbors are complaining and the cats and dogs are trying to chew off their ears
and even his new flute
why oh why did
he thought if th
from then on john would wake up at sunrise like a rooster
and the clarinet
he wasn't really breaking any laws
up and down main street
why don't you play that instead
begged doctor wong
people were getting into car accidents and everybody looked really silly a
the police chief hated the sound so much that he threw john in jail
doctor wong for a second
so there was no
he was very upset at first then
water problem no fly problem and no flute problem
i don't know why but i feel like
that the police could do
john didn't know what to do
the way his mouth
john had started playing
then suddenly a fly
they just couldn't lead a normal life
was shaped made the flute sound so bad
doctor wong was the town hero
franksville was a town that seemed to have one problem after the other
de
the good with the bad
windows were breaking and all the cows in town
but just try to imagine someone scratching a chalkboard with a fork
doctor wong and john were the stars of the parade
but
rooster john
and they didn't want to kick him out of town because they all had such nice teeth
the dentist is driving the flies away
what should they do
as back up
i wrote a song f
n where no one could hear him
but
would swat them with his hand
dentist everybody's teeth were so much whiter and cleaner
to town who played the flute so badly that people would run away screaming
the town decided to have a great big parade
said police chief sanders
oh no said police chief sanders
many musical instruments such as the guitar tuba the piano
no no please don't play your old flute d
that's how the flute sounded when this guy played it
look john i've heard you play the clarinet you're quite good
but they couldn't keep john in jail since
w was a problem in the little town of franksville
oh well good thing i brought a
since he had
so he just kept on playing his flute
couldn't even swat at the flies anymore they had to cover their ears from the horrible sound
oh that's a nice instrument but it's not the flute
then they decided to lower him down a well and let him play down there
play it quite well
their problems started when
before they knew it the town was filled with flies again
as bad as the flute sounded
then multiply that b times a hundred
they were on the main float
they couldn't hear
before i tell you how rooster john got his name you should know a little bit about the town of f franksville
they would have to take
they ever invent ears
it was then that the people of franksville realized that it
he play the song for police chief sander
john thought that was an okay idea but there was
that came later
that couldn't swat them off
he started shaking the flute to get the flies off
and no one had any cavities
in franksville
just when things were going good for franksville
so there was nothing
if he made a new mouthpiece especially shaped
but for some reason
and play to keep the flies away
flies i suppose
everybody cheered
then he played the song the police chief hated the sound so much that he threw john in jail
he started shaking the flute s to get the flies off and accidentally smashed it into pieces
but just then a man moved into town who played the flute so badly that people would run away screaming
no one could hear anything
it's the flute sound the
a big band played as they marched up and down main street everyone cheered
however for the same r reason the way his mouth was shaped made his flute sound awful
i don't know why but i feel like i have to do i have to or else bad things will happen
their problems started when they ran out of water
the bad flute player was rooster john
when the townsfolk heard the noise they couldn't even swat at the flies anymore

to celebrate the fact that for once there was no water problem no fly problem and no flute problem
they had to cover their ears from horrible sound
the people in the town decided to have a great big parade in franksville
because as bad the flute sounded it was a lot better than thousand thousands of flies crawling on them
oh no said said chief sanders just when things were go going good in franksville
but i have to play i was born to do it
franksville was a town that seemed to have one p one problem after the other
so there was a problem in the little town of franksville
i'm serious what still it's still uh still it's not as bad as millions of flies i suppose
but it was too late john had started playing
everybody's teeth were so much teeth were much whiter and cleaner and no one had any cavities
doctor wong was the town hero
john the dentist is driving the f flies away
th then they decided to lower him down a well and let him play down where no one could hear him
then the fly landed on someone else then the then some landed on a bunch of people
i i even wrote you a song chief sanders it's called cops and robbers
they got tons and tons of flies they then the flies stopped
window were breaking and all cows in town started to make sour milk
doctor wong thought for a second then p pronounced
well i'm sure you guessed that didn't work
he played many musics musical instruments such as the guitar the tuba the piano and the clarinet
they were up t they were up on the main float
it was gross then suddenly the flies flew away fast as they could
phew phew said papa bear i'm glad that's over yes indeed agreed mama
it didn't take sister long to decide to pull off those bits of tape
there was quite a lot of work spelling number problems all kinds of things
i can't get out of it without a little help
i'm not exactly sure mama sister said but some of them are getting sore
i mean but instead of a dime and instead of giving to her at the end of each day what and interesting idea said mama as she listened to wise old grizzly gran
there had been nursery school which was pure fun playing with dolls and blocks rolling clay snakes and scribbling with crayons
i i could read her the riot act to her suggested papa you know nail biting is an outrageous disgraceful habit and if you don't stop it im immediately
s and sister nibbled her nails nibble nibble nibble nibble
opps oh there it went a d a day is a long time and habits are powerful especially bad habits even with the promise of a dime sister couldn't remember not to nibble papa and mama and papa got discouraged too
when dec when some nail decided it needed nibbled the plan worked not perfectly it's hard to break a bad habit and sister had to give back some of those pennies give back some of those pennies but in ten days she had ninety three pennies
bits of tape helped sister remember not to nibble but they also got in the way when she tried to do cer certain things it's very hard to hold a pencil with tape all over your fingertips tune the tv or scratch when you have an itch
uh breathing a great sigh of relief that's when brother bear looked up looked at his fingernails and piped
habits are a very important part of our life and most of them are good like brushing your teeth and combing your fur when you get you get up up in the morning and looking both ways before you cross a road
as she thought of all the lovely dimes she was going to get but the way it turned out she didn't get a single dime all she got was discouraged all day long
here is this is where i want to plant the bulbs what about my nail biting habit asked sister as she reached out to help get the get out of the deep rut how am i s how am i going to get out of it
hmm said mama here's what we'll do we'll put a little medicine on the sores and bits of adhesive tape on all of them that way that will remind you not to nibble and you and will get the chance to grow them back
they gave sister ten pennies one for each nail at the beginning of each day
great for picking things up tuning the tv and scratching itches
i suppose so said papa thoughtfully perhaps some of some sort of reward would help a bit of money let's say a dime for every day she doesn't bite her nails
and it keeps getting deeper every time i use it
oh dear said mama bear to sister when the cubs got home from school one day
what have you tried so far mmm uh huh well i think you're on the right track with the dime but instead of giving her a dime at the instead of giving give it to her at the end of each day
but even bigger she had five finger he had she had ten fine fingernails
the berenstain bears and the bad habit
that's what happened to some cubs in teacher jane's class
a habit mama said as she pushed the wheelbarrow along the well worn path is something you do so often you don't even have to think about it
that's right said papa until the habit's broken i'll never nibble again she said
in regular school you'd have to concentrate and sometimes when you concentrate you form little nervous habits
that's why it is it is with a bad habit the more of you get use it the harder it get it is to get out of it
so they tried gran's idea instead of a dime at the end of each day
but worst of all the bits of tape told the whole world that sister bear was a nail biter
dear me no said mama nail biting is the kind of nervous habit and shouting and threatening will just make her more nervous
next had come kindergarten that was fun too there were marching games and rhythm band she also learned a lot of numbers in kindergarten and most of the alphabet
well said mama it's sort of like this path i've wheeled this wheelbarrow so many times over that it's worn a deep rut tight down the middle
oh you're very welcome my dear said gran when mama called and how is everything at your house is that so you know i was a nail biter when i was a cub and my mama helped me to stop
before she knew it she had nibbled them down to nubbins in fact she nibbled them down so far that some of her fingers were getting sore
i certainly hope you're joking roared papa because i'm not cause if you're not i'm joking i'm joking interrupted brother
oh well sighed mama life goes on i must call gran thank her for the tulip bulbs
and when sister tried to play jacks she couldn't get any higher than two twosies
sister bear who lived with her mama papa and brother in the big tree house down a down a sunny dirt road in deep in bear country had been going to school for quite a while
would you you would like to have nice nails grow back wouldn't you said mama oh yes said sister but i keep forgetting why is it so hard to remember
lizzy twirled her fur twirl twirl twirl freddy scratched his head scratch scratch scratch norman sucked his thumb suck suck suck
but some habits aren't so good like nail biter said asked sister
up you know i think i might start biting my nails i could use the money
all you need is a little help that's all said mama let's plant gran's tulips and while i think about it and later i'll talk to your papa he may have some ideas
ten pennies to keep unless she nibbled and with those pennies in her pocket jiggling when she got on the school bus jingling when she jumped in the schoolyard just waiting t to be remembered when some
the next morning when sister lined up for school lizzy bruin and some others began pointing teasing sister nibbles her nails sister nibbles her nails
and the next day and the next time she played jacks she got all the way she got all the way to tensies
now sister was in first grade regular school was different now it was still fun and she liked and she liked teacher jane very much but it wasn't all fun
why it's so deep now i can't get out of it with a little help
you've nibbled your dals nails down to nubbins in fact you've nibbled them clean off how did how did it happen
and he was sort of
maybe a poorly played flute doesn't sound all that bad
the flute sounded normal and it turned out john could play it quite well
but they couldn't keep john in jail since he wasn't really breaking any laws so there was nothing the police could do
doctor wong thought for a second then pronounced it's the flute sound the flies hate john's flute playing as much as we do

i even wrote you a song chief sanders i called it cops and robbers
then suddenly a fly landed on a little girl then a fly landed on someone else and then some landed some landed on a bunch of people
he was an excellent dentist but his real love was music
so they decided that john could play the flute and everybody else would have to wear earplugs
they were up on the main float a big band played as they marched up the town main street everyone cheered

the airplane ride
if i wanted to be a pilot
then jennifer came up to me and said she had a surprise i thought great more peanuts but it wasn't peanuts it was something really cool
the pilot told me that it wasn't really the hard one hard once you practice
that's when i missed my parents the most but once the plane was in the air i was pretty good
i had seven colas and four ginger ales which made me have to go to the bathroom eight times
but i but guess what i was too short to reach the button so i stared started yelling hey peanut lady hey peanut lady
and if she would get me a banana split i would i wouldn't have to go the bathroom as much so much
at first i thought wow look at all those buttons then i thought there's no way that anyone can remember to push all those buttons at the right time are we going to crash
i've always thought flying was fun you go higher than any mountain and you go faster than any car
i said someday i'm going to be a pilot i'll only serve banana splits on my plane
a million buttons and levers and knobs and stuff
i told her that i wanted a banana split instead but she said they don't have any banana splits on the plane
i didn't know anyone at all and i had to go all the way from new york to texas without my parents
but it was her fault she was the one that kept trying to give me peanuts
finally we landed that's always scary it seems like the plane is going too fast to ever stop but it does
jennifer took me to the cockpit and there were
he said he thought i would make a really great pilot someday if i wanted to be
i tried to watch the movie but i had already seen that one so it was boring
it and took me straight to the ice cream shop
the way i figured it my game boy or the way i figured it my game boy only has five buttons and i can get past level three
i guess it was because the plane was so loud and i didn't know anybody or anyone
i only used the green crayon because it was the tallest and i wanted it to catch up to the red brown blue yellow purple and black ones
the first time i ever took an airplane by myself it was fun and scary
he was really nice but he wouldn't play go fish with me
eventually the flight attendant seemed to get a little annoyed that i had to go the bathroom so much
she said the captain was inviting me to see the cockpit i thought awesome i also brought my deck of cards in case the pilot was bored and wanted to play go fish
she said that she had to help other passengers
my mom gave me a coloring book of cool looking dragons to keep me busy i colored the dragon pictures all green so it didn't take very long
and he told me that he w he once played a game i had on my game boy
he laughed even though i wasn't joking
i was glad that there wasn't any anyone next to me the person that sat next to me
she didn't like being called peanut lady but she did get me the game or get me my game boy
she told me to be quiet and watch the movie
but i tell you the truth without my parents there i was pretty nervous
grandpa laughed and i to and i took
if you can't even get past level one and you're a pilot then i could be a pilot s too since i'm much better at pushing buttons than you
one thing about being by yourself on your on an airplane is that the flight attendants are very nice to you
i tried to push the button that lights up the over head so the flight attendant could would come
but sometimes people like to eat peanuts on their banana splits i told her that i was that the peanuts that were making me so thirsty in the first place
i was flying there to see my grandfather and we were going to go fishing
when i got off the airplane there was grandpa waiting for me he said how wa how was your flight
i had a game boy in my backpack my backpack was o in the overhead thingy
and he couldn't even pass level one i said
would have been very annoyed
she told me to call her jennifer instead i played on my game boy until i got a new high s my new high score
it was worth the the whole trip to just eat a banana split with grandpa
the flight attendant gave me a deck of cards but she wouldn't play go fish with me
i started thinking we might crash i didn't like to think about that but i couldn't help it
imagine how hard it would be to work all those millions of buttons and eat peanuts
this means that we have a new champion the real winner is swish softbelly from blue pond the crowd went wild
that's not a rock sweetie said his mom that's mud swish made a loud gulp sound just do your best his mom said
we all want you to look good when you bring home the cup mrs snapper would say hi swishy do you want some yummy pie to fill you up and slow you down for the big race a fat turtle is a slow turtle
it looked as if neither of them had moved at all they were both moving of course but they were so slow that it was hard to tell after six hours mud and swish were still tied tied and had only moved a few inches
this was the most famous turtle there was
mrs tort went up to swish and gave him the turtle cup she said swish you are the youngest winner of the great turtle race this was the most exciting finish we've ever had i think that you'll be a great champion for many years since turtles are only only get slower with age
since turtles never cheat this is the most important rule to break this rule would mean an end to the great turtle race forever
we never thought of we never thought of that they all said the town agreed to s to treat swish like a normal turtle and after a while swish decided that he would be p proud to race for his village
he put the earplugs in his ears and couldn't hear mud singing anymore
look there's your cousin peek a boo from big puddle village said swish's mother you'll get to meet all sorts of new turtles
this turtle is named swish when swish was born every everyone thought he was a little slow but as he got older the a little older the turtles began to realize that swish was really really really slow
everything about the festival was fun but the main event was the great turtle race
after seven days of playing and dancing a bug eating finally the day of the race came the mayor of great pond mrs tort p posted the rules of the race on a tree from for everyone to see
i never promised that i would win the race i can't beat mud anyway i heard once it t it took him three days just to yawn
mud didn't answer the mayor tapped mud on the shell and said hello hello mud
mud said to mud said to swish there's no way that a turtle as young as you can be so slow even if was faster than you when i was your age you're cheating you're going to ruin the great race forever
it was because of swish that blue pond became the most respected pond in the land
there were about three hundred turtle racing three hundred turtles racing
s swish was sad that he lost but all the turtles from blue pond cheered for swish
when all turtles arrived there it was a seven day festival called the sh sh shell dwellers festival where there was lots of eating and laughing
all the extra attention made swish very uncomfortable
mister peeks would never do anything for f for free but he was going to give swish a free shell waxing this was the kind of thing that swish would get all the time
mud knew that this would be his closest race ever and he was actually getting a little bit scared
swish took up the c took the cup that day for the first time
swish read the rules ev even thought he knew them by heart then he heard the mayor say runner's please take your positions
swish had to be car carried on his father's back since it would have taken him months to get to the great pond by himself finally after the long journey all the turtles arrived at great pond
the crowd thought he must have realized that his singing trick wasn't working but they all but then right at the end right before the sunset swish started to pull ahead of mud
swish's mom smiled and said i know that you can win swish but it's an honor just to get to the race said swish's mom
the blue p blue pond was a nice village located about three day crawls from the great pond they all felt a li little sad because they hadn't held the turtle cup in over a seven hund in over seven hundred years years so with swish they thought maybe just maybe he could bring back the turtle cup to their little pond
the turtle cup was the trophy that the winner would take home to their village it had been a sludge p for pond for every fifty years because no one could ever beat their turtle
rule number two all turtles must run as fast as they can all and the turtle that is closest to the starting line wins
all the turtles in blue pond held a meeting to discuss the problem the mayor doctor softshell said this is ridiculous swish has to race he's the slowest turtle i've every seen except for mud of course without him we don't have a chance
he was tired from racing and thought that it would be nice to just listen to mud's sweet voice and fall asleep
mud still didn't answer in fact mud was sound asleep
then mud tried another trick he started singing a soft beautiful lullaby which started swish started yawning
but through but though he came to the greatest and biggest turtle of all time much greater or bigger than mud he always made sure that no one treated him special and that he treated li everybody like he wanted to be treated like a turtle with honor
the mayor of pondland went to the president of the turtle cup to sludge pond again
there was he was the slowest turtle of all time he hadn't had to move for fifty years he was the biggest the most respected and also one of the trickiest turtles there was there were many legends about him
the slowest turtle every four years turtles from all over the land would crawl to the great pond it would make some turtles from far a away villages two whole weeks just to get there
swishes father said son i have something to tell you as you know your great great grand turtle raced mud once he wasn't as slow as you but he did teach me l about mud's dirty tricks
and that would
but now all the turtles were usually way ahead of mud but this time swish swish was just as slow
mrs snapper was very nice to anyone she was being nice to swish
rule number four no turtle may fall asleep since since if you are asleep you aren't running as fast as you can
for the first time in six hundred years i would like to present the turtle cup to blue pond the crowd went wild again
when the time of the festival drew near all the turtles in the land started toward the great started toward great pond
i wish a sudden swish was suddenly very excited he told his mom you know what i'm going to win you know i'm going to win this race i know it and all these turtles will know that blue pond rules i'm not afraid of stupid mud
once his mother called him for dinner and he didn't make it home until breakfast the next morning and he was only a foot away
they read rule number one the great race begins at sunrise and ends at sunset
the win the winner of the great turtle race was so important that he or she didn't have much to move for four years until the next festival the less a turtle moves is the bigger they get and the longer they live so you can see winning the great the great race is an honor
so one day he told his parents i don't want to race
but swish wouldn't let mud scare him you're just trying to make me quit and i'm not going to fall for your tricks he said turtles never cheat and i'm a turtle with honor
he would never lose the turtle cup for the rest of his long life
but they were very proud he gave mud such a close race swish was happy too but deep down inside he knew he was just as slow as mud
this was swish's first ever shell dwellers festival and he thought it was the most wonderful thing he had ever seen there were thousands of turtles all different species all having great time all having a great time
when mud was in his prime there was a new turtle born in the blue pond
he thought sure they are nice to me because they think i can win the race but if i lose they'll be disappointed and mad at me
then he whispered in swish's ear all the tricks that his great great grand turtle taught him
what would you like to say to all the turtles at the festival the crowd started yelling speech speech
who is this young punk he thought to himself
the slowest turtles from each pond were carried to the starting line by members of their village
he would take it many more times after that
oh no shouted the fans mud's winning it looks like mud is still getting is still the greatest turtle of them all and when the sun went down mud was the closest turtle to the starting line the starting line
s swish saw a rock in the middle of the field and wondered how come they don't move all move that big rock out of the field it seems to be in everyone's way swish said
this time it was a bit closer than you would have liked i bet
after a few more hours most of the turtles had gone a few feet all except two swish and mud were both back at the starting line
rule number three no turtle may pretend to be going fast but go slow instead all turtles must go as fast as they can at all times
then he snapped out of it and remembered his father had warned him of this trick he reached in his shell and pulled out a couple of earplugs
mud had actually sung himself to sleep ladies and gentlemen she said mud from sludge pond has been disqualified for sleeping during the race
he announced well well mud it looks like you've done it sludge pond wins the turtle cup again
windows were breaking and all the cows in town started to make sour milk
the people in the town decided to have a great big parade in franksville to celebrate the fact that
no no please don't play your old flute begged doctor wrong
and
laws so there was nothing
ever invent ears
i wrote you a song with the flute called
the local
but soon after that they started to get flies
so there is a problem
john didn't know what to do so he kept playing his flute
that came later
with his new flute
he played many musical instruments such as the guitar tuba and the piano and the clarinet
because as bad as the flute sounded it was a lot better than the thousands of flies crawling on them
it was gross then suddenly the flies flew away fast as they could
else something bad will happen
you should know a little bit about the town of franksville
i'm serious
were landing on everyone
but i feel like i have to or else i'm
since he wasn't really breaking any laws
a big band band played as they marched up and down main street everyone cheered
would have to take the good with the bad
doctor wrong wrong was
all had such nice teeth
or even
before i tell you
with a fork and then multiply that times a hundred
soon t then soon tons of flies
when the townsfolks heard the noise they couldn't even swat at the flies anymore
the neighbors are complaining and the cats and dogs are trying to chew off their ears
dancing to music that they couldn't really hear
so should i start here
but just try to imagine someone scratching a chalkboard
doctor wrong and john were the stars of the parade
the police hated the sound so much that he threw john in jail
especially shaped for john's mouth then perhaps he could play the flute normally
they couldn't keep john in jail
he was an exc excellent dentist
and accidentally smashed it into pieces he was very upset at first then he said oh well good thing i brought my old flute as a back up
the way his mouth was shaped made the flute sound so bad that
wasn't really breaking any
why did they
it's the flute song the flies hate
why don't you play that instead the police said the police sanders
their problems started when they ran out of water
since he had become the town dentist everybody's teeth were much whiter and cleaner
oh no said the police sanders
the flute the bad flute player was rooster john
john thought that was an ok idea but there is s
besides everyone loved john
then suddenly a fly landed on a little girl and then
the town hero
well i'm sure you guessed that didn't work
then the flies stopped
rooster john
then two landed on everyone
then one landed on everyone
for once there was no water problem no fly problem and no flute problem
everybody looked really silly at dances
but it was too late john had started playing
we can't let you play the flute anymore john said the police chief sanders
maybe a poorly played flute doesn't sound all that bad
they got tons and tons of flies
john was the dentist john the dentist is driving away the flies
cops and robbers then he played the song for police sanders
the flies were so annoying so he would swat at them with his hand
he was the new town dentist
in the little town of franksville what should they do
he started shaking the flute to get the flies off
but for some reason
why don't you
from then on john would wake up at sunrise like a rooster and play to keep the flies away
franksville was a town that seemed to have one problem after the other
look john i've heard you play the clarinet you're quite good
before they knew it the town was filled with flies again
still it's not as bad as a million flies i suppose
then they decided to lower him down in a well and let him play where no one could hear him
so there is nothing that the police could do
the
so they decided that john could play the flute and everybody else would have to wear earplugs
but his real love was music
but just then a man moved to town playing a flute so badly that the people would run away screaming
how rooster john got his name
the flies would land all over the people and they couldn't swat them off
that's how the flute sounded when this guy played it
they just couldn't read lead a normal life
they had to cover their ears from the horrible sound
but i have to play i was born to do it i don't know why
so they were on the main float
guess what it worked
it was then the people of franksville realized that they had
but they couldn't keep john in jail since
they didn't want to kick him out of the town because they
his fish would jump out of their fish bowl
thankfully when someone was digging a hole and found water
john's flute playing as much as we do
oh that's a nice instrument but it's not the flute
just when things were going good for franksville
it wa he wasn't called rooster john yet
and no one had any cavities
an echo in the well that made the flute sound louder
uhm another on a lil on a big girl
the flute sounded normal and it turned out that john could play it quite well
no one could hear anything people were getting into car accidents and
the mayor of great pond mrs tort po posted the rules on the race on a tree for everyone to see
mud didn't answer in fact mud was asleep
for example mister peeks located shell cleaner would say hey the swish er hey there swish do you want a free shell waxing today
the winner of the great turtle race was so important that he didn't have to move for four years until the next festival
mud knew that he would that this was being the closest race he had ever was actually getting a little bit scared
finally after the long journey all the turtles arrived at the great pond
the turtles all stretched and s thought really slow slow thoughts as they did the sky turned from black to dark blue
he would never lose the turtle cup for the rest of his long life
i'll i never promised that i would win the race i can't beat mud anyway i heard once it took him three days just to yawn
there were s many legends about him it was it was rumored he was so slow his heart would only beat once a day
swish saw a rock in the middle of the field and wondered
i'm not going to fall for your tricks he said turtles never cheat and i'm not and i'm a turtle with honor
but by now turtles were usually way ahead of mud but this time swish was just as slow
oh no shouted the fans mud's winning looks it looks like mud is still the greatest turtle of them all
since turtles never cheat this is the most important rule to break this rule would mean to get to end the great turtle race forever
ruin the great race forever
you get to meet all of sorts of new turtles
except for two swish and mud were both at back at the starting line
but he doesn't want to be treated special he just wants to be normal and doesn't want any anyone to hate him because he can't beat mud
he put them on he put the earplugs in his ears and couldn't hear mud's singing anymore
just do your best his mom said
blue pond was a nice village located about three days crawl from great pond
it would take some turtles from far away villages two whole weeks just to get there
you have to remember that everything he gifted is being slow he's still very young and said swish's father
mrs snapper was n never nice to anyone but she was being nice to swish
i think that you will be a great champion for many years since turtles only get slower with age the for the first time in six hundred years i would like to present the turtle cup to blue pond
it had been in a sludge pond for fifty years because no one could ever beat the their turtle this was the famous turtle there was
rule number two all turtles must run as fast as they can and the turtle that is closest to the starting line wins
ladies and gentlemen he said mud from sludge pond has been disqualified for sleeping during the race
you we all want you to look good when you bring home the cup mrs mrs snapper would say hi swishy do you want to come have some yummy pie to fill you up and slow you down for the big race
even i was faster when faster than you when i was your age you're cheating you're not going to
there were thousands of turtles different species all having a great time
the turtles were very very very slow so it took them long time before they could before anyone could figure out which turtles were the slowest
much greater or bigger than mud
all the turtles in blue pond held a meeting to discuss the problem
then snapped out of it and remembered his father had warned him out of his trick
when mud w in was in his prime there was a new turtle b born in the blue pond this turtle was named swish
that's not a rock sweetie that's mom that's mud
when swish was born everyone thought he was w a little slow but he got a little older and the older turtles began to realize that swish was really really slow
they were very far proud t he gave mud such a close race swish was happy too but deep down inside he knew he was just as slow as mud
this means we will that we have a new champion the real winner is swish softbelly of blue pond the crowd went wild
the turtle cup was a trophy that the winner could take home to their village
mud was the closest turtle to the starting line
swish read the rules even though he knew by heart h h he knew them by heart then he heard the mayor say runner's please take your positions
you're just trying to make me quit
they were both moving of course because but they were so slow that it was hard to tell
the sun the crowd thought he must have realized his singing trick wasn't working
he wasn't as slow as you a as slow as you but he did teach me about mud's dirty t tricks
when he whispered in swish's ear all the tricks that the great great grand turtle taught him
so with swish they th they thought maybe just maybe he could bring it back to bring back the turtle cup to their little pond
what what would you like to say to all the turtles to the festival the crowd started yelling speech speech
where there was lots of eating and laughing turtles could catch up with their friends they had not seen since the last festival
when the time came for the festival drew near
this was the kind of thing that swish would get all the time
he would take it many more times after that
he hadn't m hadn't had to move for over fifty years
i'm not afraid of stupid mud
mud was actually sung himself to sleep
they read rule number one the great race begins at sunrise and ends at sunset
this was swish's first ever shell dwellers festival and he thought that it it was the most wonderful thing he had ever seen
the last turtle or the less a turtle moves the bigger they got s and the longer they live
who is was this young punk he thought to himself mud and said to swish there's no way that that a turtle as young as you can be as slow
but through though he became the greatest bi and biggest turtle of all time
so one day his parents his par told his parents i don't want to race
they look at the horizon and saw the sun was starting the rise just then the mayor said ready set slow and off they went
how come they don't move that big rock out of the field it seems that everyone's in the way said swish
his name was mud and he was the greatest champion of his of in the history of shell dweller's festival he was unbeatable
th he was tired from racing though he would nice just to listen to mud's sweet voice and fall asleep
swish was sad that he had lost but all the turtles from blue pond cheered for swish
the slowest turtle
so you can see the winning g great race is a great honor
when mud tried another trick he started singing a soft beautiful lullaby swish started yawning
then the sunset went down
rule number four no turtle may fall asleep since you since if are asleep you aren't running as fast as you can
swish was suddenly very excited he told his mom you know what i'm going to win this race
but swish wouldn't let mud scare him
it took it looked as if neither of them had moved at all
swishes father said son i have something to tell you as you know your great great grand turtle raced mud once
mud kept singing his lullaby for a few hours but then he stopped right before sunset
they they all felt a little sad because they hadn't held the turtle cup in over seven hundred years
he announced well mud it looks like you've done it sludge pond wins the turtle cup again this is the time it would be a a bit next time it would be a little bit closer than you would have liked i i'll bet
we never thought of that they all said the town agreed to treat swish like a normal turtle and after a while swish decided that he would proud he would be proud to race for his village
mister peeks would never do anything for free but he was going to give swish a free well s sh shells waxing
the crowd went wild again swish took the cup that day for the first time
i know it and these turtles will know that blue pond rules
he was the slowest turtle of all time
a fat turtle is a slow turtle
rule number three no turtle may pretend to go faster but go slow instead all turtles must go as fast as they can at all times
look there's your cousin peek a boo from big puddle village swish's mother said
he was always made sure that no one treated him special that he and that he treated everyone like he wanted to be treated like a turtle with honor
the mayor doctor softshell said this is ridiculous swish has to race hear he is the slowest turtle i've every seen except for mud of course without him i don't have we don't have a chance
after a few hours most of the turtles had gone a few feet
swish made a loud gulp sound
he reached i he reached in t his shell and pulled out a couple of earplugs
when his mother called him in for dinner he didn't make it home until breakfast the next morning and he was only a foot away
the mayor of pondland went to present the turtle cup to sludge pond again
every four years turtles from all over the land would crawl to the great pond
mrs tort went up to swish gave him the turtle cup she said swish you are the youngest winner of the great turtle race that was the most exciting finish i've ever had
the slowest turtles from each pond were carried to the starting line by members of their villages
after six hours mud and swish were still tied and only moved a few inches
but then but then right at the end right before the sunset swish started to pull ahead of mud
mud didn't answer the mayor tapped mud on the sh shell and said hello hello mud
everyone treated swish differently
after seven days of playing and dancing a bug eating finale the day of the race came
all turtles in the land started t towards the great pond swish had to be carried on his father's back since it would have to take him months to get to great pond by himself
everything about the festival was fun but the main event was the great turtle race
it was because of swish that blue pond became the most respected pond in the land
there were about three hundred turtles racing they were all the slowest of the slow
swish's mom smiled and said i know you can win swish but it's an honor just to get to race said swish's mom
he was one of the biggest and most respected and also one of the trickiest turtles there was
how did it happen i'm not exactly sure mama sister said but some of them are getting sore
not perfectly it's hard to break a habit sister had to give back some pennies of the some of the back had to give back some of those pennies but in ten days she had ninety three pennies
i'll never nibble again she said as she thought of all those lovely dimes she was going to get
the next morning when sister lined up for school lizzy bruin and some other others began pointing at her and teasing sister nibbles her nails sister nibbles her nails it didn't take sister long to decide mmm long to decide to it didn't take sister long to decide to pull off those bits of tape
i certainly hope you're joking roared papa because if you're not i'm joking i'm joking interrupted brother and he was sort of
dear me no said mama nail biting is a kind of nervous habit and shouting at and shouting and threatening will just make her more nervous
and the next time she played jacks when she got all she got all the way up to the tensies
my mama helped me stop what you ha what have you tried so far uhm uh huh well i think you're on well i think you're on the right track with a dime but instead of a dime and instead of giving it to her at the end of the day
well said mama it's sort of like this path i've wheeled this barrow over it over it so many times that it's that it's well it's worn a deep rut right down the middle and it keeps getting deeper every time i use it
lizzy twirled her fur twirl twirl twirl freddy scratched his head scratch scratch scratch norman sucked his thumb suck suck suck sis and sister nibbled her nails nibble nibble nibble nibble
first there had been a nursery school where which was pure fun playing with dolls blocks rolling clay snakes and scribbling with crayons
i suppose so said papa thoughtfully perhaps some sort of reward would help a bit of money let's say a dime for every day she doesn't bite her nails
you just need a little help that's all said mama let's let's plant gran's tulips while i think about it and later i'll talk to your papa he he may have some ideas
the the bits of tape helped sister remember remember not to nibble but they a but they also got in the way when she tried to do certain things
but even better she had ten fine fingernails
a day is a long time and habits are powerful especially bad habits even with the promise of a dime sister couldn't remember not to nibble mama and papa got discouraged too
habits are very important uh is a habits are a very important l part of our lives most of them are good brushing your teeth and combing your fur when you get up in the morning and looking both ways before you cross a road but some habits aren't so good
but it wasn't all fun there there was quite a lot of work spelling number problems all kinds of things
it was very hard to hold a pencil with tape all over your fingertips or turn on the tv or scratch when you have an itch when sis when sis and when sister tried to play jacks she couldn't get any
that's when br brother bear looked at his fingernails and piped up you know i think i might start biting my f nails i could use some money
that's that's the way it is with your bad habit more you get use it the harder it is to to get it out of it here this is that i want this is where i want to plant the bulbs
before she knew it it before she knew it she had nibbled them down to nubbins in fact she nibbled them so far that some of her fingers were getting sore
so they tried gran's idea instead of a dime at the end of each day they they they gave sis sister ten pennies for each nail at the beginning of one for each nail at the beginning of the day ten pennies to keep unless she nibbled
before mama before mama could answer sister bear w who had been nervously nibbling in the next room popped in and said a dime ten w whole cents every day for day just for not biting my nails
but worst of all bits of tape but worst of all the bits of tape told the whole world sister bear was a nail biter
get out of it
hmm said mama well h here's what we'll do we'll put a little m medi medicine on the sores one on the sore ones and bits of ad adhesive tape on all of them that will remind you not not to nibble and get back and will give them a chance to grow back
but the way it turned out she never she didn't get a single dime all she got was discouraged
now sister was in first grade regular school was different sh it was still fun and she liked teacher jane very much but it wasn't all f it wasn't
a habit mama said as she pushed the wheelbarrow along the well worn path is something you do so often you don't even have to think about it
the berenstain bears and the bad habit
phew said papa bear i'm glad that's over yes indeed agreed mama breathing a great sigh of relief
what and interesting idea said mama as she listened to the wise to wise old gr grizzly gran
why it's so deep now i can't i can't get out of i can't get out of it with a li i can't get out i get i can't get out i can't i can't get out of it without a little help
next came kindergarten
than twosies than twosies
i could read the riot act to her suggested papa you know nail biting is an outrageous disgraceful habit and if and if you don't stop it immediately
great for picking things up turning on the tv and scratching itches
oh well sighed mama life goes on i call gran and and thank her for the tulip tulip bulb mm bulbs oh you're very welcome my dear said gran when mama called and how is everything at your house is that so you know i was a nail biter when i was a cub
like nail biting sister asked you would like to have you ni nice nails grow back wouldn't you was mama's bear was mama's answer
oh yes said sister but i keep forgetting why is it so why is it hard to remember
in regular school you have to concentrate some some and sometimes when you concentrate you form little nervous habits and that's what happened to some cubs in teacher jane's class
sister bear who lived who lived with her mama and papa and her brother in the big tree house down a sunny dirt road deep in bear country had been going to school for quite a while
she couldn't higher than
what about my nail biting habit asked sister as she helped mama get out of the deep rut how am i going to get rid of it
and those pennies and with those pennies in her pocket jiggling when she got on the school bus jing jingling when she jumped rope in the schoolyard just waiting to rem just waiting to be remembered when some nail decided it needed a nibble the plan worked
oh dear said mama mama bear to sister when the cubs got home from school one day you've nibbled your da you've nibbled your nails down to nubbins in fact you've nibbled them clean off
that's right said papa until the habit's broken
n next had come kindergarten that was fun too th there were marching games and a rhythm band she also learned a lot of numbers in kindergarten and most of the alphabet
i could use the money
but physically fitness was not the only reason that fred loved the pandas the other
but yin yin the young panda
i'm sorry to say but many but many a little boy's cheeks have been made raw when mother poo poo panda was upset
this can almost certainly be accounted for by this strange almost magical effect that the pandas possess
talking about since they hadn't thought or talked of much else since yin yin said i want to go there and pointed to the moon
back in the panda's home the moon panda mother panda poo poo was very proud of her daughter
she could be a very persuasive little bird when she when she want when she wanted
that is just the type of exposure we needed those pandas will be with us for a long time
it it wouldn't be best to fly
yes but what does that have to do with pandas man
how to turn your head all the way around without getting a terrible pain in the neck said owl
likely not made of cheese and most certainly not made of bamboo yin yin and her best friend maggie the magpie who looked like a panda would look if pandas were birds were discussing about h going to the moon
the main obstacle it turns out getting the rocket ship off the ground
why he was feeding the pandas like he was supposed to
such nonsense going to the moon said her mother poo poo
fred was not allowed to actually hug the panda bears since they could be dangerous so all the other people at the zoo could would know that the pandas had just been fed when they saw fred hugging
fred fred fred fed the panda bears the tigers and turtles the turtles weren't so bad but as for the tigers he wasn't so sure
moon
i think that the zoo needs it's a great ad advertising campaign
eight eighty five point five degree spot on his left kidney but the point is that he was very fond of feeding the pandas
is a decidedly round about way to go if you must go it
reas reason was that any who anyone who gets within three feet of a panda automatically falls in love with them
a quicker way to get to get around europe in order to improve trade
oh wise owl i have a question that i fear only you can answer she said
was not listening to fred she was talking to her best friend maggie the magpie about going to the moon yes the big one in the sky that is almost like
yin yin was always one to make good advice for his father and less than a week later yin yin and maggie had built a rocket ship out of bamboo
one morning fred was feeding yin yin and said oh yin yin i wish that more people could come to visit the zoo
that once you could over one thousand magpies together they tend to fight and can't agree on a single thing
going to the moon indeed nonsense your job is to be s
but later when fred walked into the panda's home under a his new yellow umbrella all she could think to say was nonsense
it's a law of nature
why did a panda with the beautiful girl name yin yin have her name changed to the very un beautiful girl name columbus
actually it was a eight
i see fred one more thing sir about those magpies flying above the pandas do you think that the zoo could purchase m me a large size sized umbrella
the owl instantly replied two hundred thousand and seventy six give or take two
they said together pulling with all their might i see your wings flapping but we don't seem to be going anywhere said yin yin
it's taken me a couple of weeks to figure it out but i think yin yin wants to go to the moon and the magpies want to take her there said fred
she said pit spitefully
rather un cuddly palm tree outside of the pandas hom home
her mother the f her mother and father knew that they were
so before he ran off to hug the palm tree quickly said it costs so much to feed you pandas i would hate if you had to leave us after all it's the only home you know
they were in order of cuteness yin yin the young daughter poo poo the mother and moo man the gentle and always sleepy father
yin yin's father moo man didn't think it was very proper t or wise for a young panda bear to go rolling off to places where there wasn't any bamboo
the zoo keeper said good heavens man that is a great idea no wait a second i don't understand well sir when columbus set out on his ship he was really trying to find
so maggie flew to the owl and asked for his advice
but everything was not all bamboo and hugs at the zoo
enough of this nonsense nonsense said yin yin's mother poo poo what sort of nonsense is this for a young panda bear
a week later despite much flapping they were still trying to get the rocket in the air it turns out that the owl didn't take the consideration that one
no one could blame fred really since no one really wants to be eaten
after all if it weren't for yin yin they would have had to move for their wonderful home from their wonderful home
fred thought about it and said you know i think we should rename yin yin columbus
as for yin yin she was very proud to re to be renamed after a famous explorer and she and maggie never stopped trying to get to the moon
the panda
some people do like to bite their finger nails but each afternoon at three o'clock when it was time to feed the tigers for fred when it came to pandas he had a warm spot in his heart
pandas man said the zoo manager well it seems to me sir that yin yin wanted to be a great explorer instead became a business woman
nonsense said the mother i'm so mad i'm going to look at the lady over there and make her want to squeeze her son cheeks
no how many magpie's would be needed to fly a four hundred pound panda bear and a one hundred pound bamboo rocket ship to the moon said maggie
maggie figured that if she and three of the strongest magpie friends were to each grab hold of a corner of the rocket ship they could fly to the moon so they tried one two three to the moon
but i just learned how to make myself into a ball and roll two days ago and i've becoming very good at it
so one day after fred had fed the pan pandas and he was hugging the pla palm tree the zoo manager came up to him and said what is going on with y your pandas fred i've never seen anything like it
he didn't mind handling the raw meat he had to feed
fred was starting to feel the uncontrollable urge to hug the panda
i don't think it will take that long to roll there said yin yin
there were there pan there were three pandas and they were known as the pan family
he wanted to be a business man but instead became a great explorer
i know i shouldn't be telling you this but we might have to sell you and your family to the zoo in san angeles if we didn't don't get more money
bamboo is very workable substance and pandas tend to handle bamboo a lot so this in itself was not that astonish astonishing at least to yin yins parents fred sure was impressed though
is to be cute so people want to run the gift shop and buy panda bear dolls it's industry which young lady helps pay for the bamboo that you eat
now while all this was going on what do you think s what do you supposed fred was doing
at further distance pandas have a strange almost magical effect on human beings which makes us want to hug and squeeze things
it was fred's idea so l let's begin with fred
it's not that you aren't selling enough stuffed panda bears it's just that there haven't been enough people coming to see you in the first place
the zoo manager laughed and walked away but did purchase a fashionable yellow umbrella for fred the next day
a week later maggie managed to round up two hundred thousand and seventy s eight magpie
hmm heavier than i thought i think we better i think we'll need more magpies said maggie yes but how about many yes but how many more yin yin said i'm not sure exactly replied maggie
oh well that makes sense said the manager did you know that since the little panda built the bamboo rocket ship and those magpie's started fluttering about that the zoo's profits have gone up four four thousand percent t
it is interesting to point at this time that more stuffed panda bears are sold at zoo gift shops then all of the other stuff animals combined
an instant later a young boy was heard saying ouch mom cut that out
to the tigers he mean his main object was to begin eaten
besides if you leave i'll get terribly out of shape now if you excuse me i need to squeeze something before i scream
the father watched this all through one eye for he always had at least one eye asleep at all times said t'would be best to ask the owl then closed his eye
but he was supportive of his young daughter and showed his support taking a n nap
many people know that pandas eat bamboo a lot of it a lot of bamboo can get quite heavy so because of the pandas fred came very strong and was in terrific shape
besides everybody loved john since he had become the town de dentist everybody's teeth were much whiter and cleaner and no one had any cavities
he was the new town dentist he was an excellent dentist
came up with an idea he thought that if he made a new mouthpiece especially shaped for john's mouth then perhaps he could play the flute normally
their problems started with when they ran out of water
no one could hear anything people were getting into car accidents and everybody looked really silly at dances
look john i've heard you play the clarinet you're quite good why don't you play that instead said jeff sanders chief sanders
it's the flute sound the flies hate john's flute playing as much as we do
then a fly landed on someone else then some landed on a bunch of people
no no please don't play your old flute doctor began begged doctor wong but it was too late john had started playing
doctor wong thought for a second that
however for some reason the way his mouth was shaped made his flute sound awful
maybe a poorly played flute doesn't sound all that bad but just try to imagine someone scratching a chalkboard with a fork and then multiply the times a hundred
rooster john
that's how the flute sounded when the guy played it
the flies would land all over the people and they c couldn't swipe at them them off
excellent dentist he was real
and guess what it worked doctor wong was the town hero the flute sounded normal and it turned out john could play it quite well
but soon after that they started to get flies they got tons and tons of flies
then they decided to lower him down a well and let him play down where no one could hear him
oh that's a nice instrument but it's just not the flute i even wrote you a song chief sanders it's called cops and robbers
oh no said
then they had to cover their ears from the horrible sound
pronoun pronounced
so they decided that john could play the flute and everybody else would have to wear earplugs
he started shaking the flute to get the flies off the off and accidentally smashed it into pieces
the neighbors are complaining and the cats and dogs are trying to chew off their ears
chief hated the sound so much that he threw john in jail
dancing to music they couldn't even hear they just couldn't led a nor live lead a normal life
thankfully someone was digging a hole and found water
john the dentist is driving the flies away
then pretty soon tons of flies were landing on everyone before they knew it the town was filled with flies again
when the townsfolks heard the noise they couldn't even swat at the flies anymore
they could keep john in jail and they didn't want to kick him out of town because they all had such nice teeth
doctor wong and john
windows were breaking and all the cows in town started to make
john didn't know what to do so he just kept on playing his flute the flies were annoying so he would s sweet sweat at them with his hand or even his new flute
chef
we can't let you play the flute anymore john said police chef sanders
i'm serious still it's not as bad as millions of flies i suppose
what should they do
it was gross then suddenly the flies flew away fast as they could
but his real love was music he played many musical instruments such as the car the guitar the tuba the piano and the clarinet
just though that was an ok john thought that was an ok idea but there was an echo in the well that made the flute sound louder
then the flies stopped but just then a man moved into town who played the flute so badly that people would run away screaming
from then on john would wake up at sunrise like a rooster and play to keep the flies away
then he played the song the police
as bad as the flute sounded it was a lot better than thousands of flies crawling on them
were the stars of the parade they were up on the main float big band played as they marched up and down main street everyone cheered then suddenly a fly landed on a little girl
sour milk the local scientist doctor wong
he was very upset at first then he said oh well good thing i brought my old flute as back up
well i am sure you guessed that didn't work
but i have to play i was born to do it i don't know why but i feel like i have to or else bad things will happen
the bad flute player was rooster john he wasn't called rooster john yet that came after
but they couldn't keep john in jail since he was really breaking any laws so there was nothing the police could do
she liked being called peanut lady
he once played the game i had on my game boy and he couldn't even pass level one
i played on my game boy until i got my new high score
he was really nice but he wouldn't play go fish with me
five buttons and i
uhm she had to help other passengers
i've always thought flying was fun
grandpa laughed and took me straight to the ice cream shop
i was glad that there wasn't anyone next to me the person next to m to me would have been very annoyed
sh
of cool looking dragons to keep me busy
it was the peanuts that were making me so thirsty in the first place
uhm the airplane ride
when i got off the airplane
i didn't like to think about that but i couldn't help it
he laughed even though i wasn't joking
is going too fast to ever stop but it does
was in the overhead thingy
i started thinking he mi we might crash
she was the one who kept trying to give me pea peanuts
one thing about being
there's no way that anyone can remember to push th all these buttons at the right time we are going to crash
she told me to be quiet and watch the movie
that's always scary it seemed like the plane
can't get past three levels
my pack my backpack was in
but to tell you the truth without my parents there i was pretty nervous
she said the captain was inviting me to s see the cockpit
i only used the green crayon because it was the tallest and i wanted it to catch up with the red brown blue yellow purple and black ones
at first i thought wow look at all these buttons then i thought
i didn't know anyone at all and had to go all the way from new york to texas without my parents
there was grandpa waiting for me he said how was your flight
i had seven cola's and four ginger ale's which made me have to go to the bathroom eight times
my mom gave me a coloring book
but sometimes people like to eat peanuts on their banana splits so i told her that
but guess what i was too short to reach the button so i started yelling hey peanut lady hey peanut lady
then he told me that
the way i figured it my game boy only was five
the flight attendant gave me a deck of cards but she wouldn't play go fish with me
i said if you can't even get past level one and you're a pilot then couldn't
me into the cockpit and there was there were a million buttons and levers and knobs and stuff
finally we landed
then jennifer came up to me and said she had a surprise i thought great more peanuts
you go higher than any mountain and go faster than any car
i had a game boy in my backpack
it was worth the whole trip just to eat a banana split with grandpa
eventually the flight attendant seemed to get a little annoyed that i had to go to the bathroom so much but it was
but it wasn't peanuts it was something really cool
i colored the dragon pictures all green so it didn't take me very long
oh she didn't like being called peanut lady
and that if
the first time i ever took an airplane ride by myself it was fun and scary
by yourself on an airplane is that the flight attendants are very nice to you
that's when i missed my parents the most but once the plane was in the air i was pretty good
it wasn't really hard once you practiced
i tried to push the button that lights up over the h over my head so the flight attendant would come
i told her that i wanted a banana split instead but she said they don't have banana splits on the plane
i also brought my deck of cards in case the pilot was bored and wanted to play go fish
he said he thought
my game boy
i tried to watch the movie but i had already seen the one so it was boring
be then i could be a pilot too since i'm much better at pushing buttons than you are
imagine how hard it would be to work with millions of buttons and get and eat peanuts
the pilots told me that
but it was her fault
i thought awesome
but she did get me
she would get me a banana split i wouldn't have to go the bathroom so much
i was flying there to see my grandfather and we were going fi to go fishing
i said someday i'm going to be a pilot and i'll only serve banana splits on the plane
jennifer took
i would make a great pilot someday if i wanted to be
she told me to call her jennifer instead
she said she had to
i certainly hope you're joking sa roared papa because if you're not i'm j i'm joking i'm joking interrupted brother and he was sort of
when some nail decided wait just waiting to be remembered when some nail decided it needed to be a ended be a nibble
the next had come next had come kindergarten that was fun too there were there were marching games and rhythm band
oh dear said mama bear to sister when her cubs got home from the school one day you've nibbled your nails down to rub ribbons in fact you've nibbled them clean off how did that happen i'm not exactly sure mama sister said but some of them are getting sore
what you have have you tried so far uhm uh huh well i think you're on the right track track with a dime but instead of a dime and s instead of giving it to her at the end of the day
here this is what i want you to er here this is where i want you to plant the bulbs
stan and jan berenstain random house new york
now sister was in first grade regular school was was different i it was still fun and she liked teacher jane very much but it wasn't all fun there was quite a lot of work spelling number problems and all kinds of things
a day is a is a long time and habits a and habits are powerful especially bad habits even with the promise of a dime sister couldn't remember to ke not to nibble mama and papa got discouraged too
oh yes sister cr sister cried but i keep forgetting why is it so hard to remember
and the next time she played jacks she got up to ten tensies
the bits of tape h helped sister remember not to nibble but they also got in the way when she tried to do do certain things it's very hard to hold a pencil with the with tape on your fingertips
so they tried gran gran's idea instead of a dime at the end of the of each day they gave sister ten pennies one for each nail and at the beginning of each day ten pennies to keep unless she nibbled
you just need a little help that's all said mama let's plant gran's tulips while i think about it and later i'll talk to your papa he may have some ideas
so she also learned a lot of numbers in ki in kindergarten and most of the alphabet
i will never nibble again she said as she as she thought of the all those lovely dimes that was going she was going to get
and looking both ways before you cross a road both habits aren't but some habits aren't so good
hmm said mama well here's what w w w what we'll do we'll put a little medicine on on the sore ones and bits of adhesive tape on all of them that will that will remind you not to nibble and will give them give them a chance to grow back
what an interesting idea said mama as she listened to wise old grizzly gran
what about my nail biting habit asked sister as she helped mama out of the deep rut how am i going to get out of it
but worst of all the bits of tape told told the whole world that sister bear was a nail biter
oh well sighed mama life goes on i must call gran and thank her for thank her for the tulip for thank her for the tulip bulbs
well m said mama it's sort of a like this path we we i've wheeled this barrow over it so many times that it's worn a deep rut right though right down the middle and it keeps getting deeper every time i use it why it's so deep is because i can't get out out of it without a little help
breathing a wait breathing a great sigh of relief that's what brother bear looked at his that's when br brother bear looked at his fingernails and piped up you know i think i might start biting my nails i could use the money
i suppose so said papa thoughtfully perhaps some of some sort o of reward would help a bite a bite of m bit of money
before mama could answer sister bear who had been nervously nib nibbling her nibbling in the next room popped in and said a dime ten whole cents every day just for not biting my nails that's right said papa until the habit's broken
the plan worked per not perfectly it's hard to break a habit and sister had to give back some of those pennies but in ten days she had ninety three pennies
uh a habit mama said as she pushed the wheelbarrow along the wheel well worn path is something you do so often you don't even have to think about it habits are are a very important part of our lives and most of them are good like brushing your teeth and combing your fur when you get up in the morning
bulbs
sister bear who lived with her mama papa and brother in the big tree house down a sunny dirt road deep in bear country had been going to school for quite a while
twirl lizzy twirled her fur twirl twirl twirl freddy scratch scratched his head scratch scratch scratch norman sucked on his thumb suck suck suck sister nibbled on her nails nibble nibble nibble nibble nibble
phew said papa bear i'm glad that that's over yes indeed gr agreed mama
or tune or tune the tv or scratch you ha or scratch you when you have an itch or and when sister tried to play jacks she couldn't she couldn't wait she couldn't get any higher than two twosies
i could read you a riot act to her i could read the riot act to her suggested papa you know nail biting is outrage is an outrageous disgraceful habit and you don't have a and if you don't stop it immediately dear me no said mama nail biting is kind of a nervous habit and shouting and threatening will just just make her more nervous
the bear the berenstain bears and the bad habit
but all but the way it turned out she didn't get a single dime she was she got discouraged
but even better she had ten fine fingernails great for picking up things turning on turning the t tuning the tv and scratching itches
like like like nail biting said asked sister you would like to have your nice nails grow back wouldn't you said was mama's answers
let's say a dime for every day she doesn't bite her nails
first there had been a nursery school which was pure fun playing with dolls blocks rolling clay snakes and scribbling with crayons
oh you're very welcome my dear said said gran when mama called and how is everything at your house is that so you know i was a nail biter when i was a cub and my mama helped me stop
and and less than a week uhm later yin yin and maggie had built a rocket ship out of bamboo bamboo is very workable substance said panda and pandas tend to handle bamboo a lot so i if in itself that not what astonishing at least to yin yin yin yin yin's parents fred fred sure was impressed though
to fly four hundred pound panda bear and a one hundred pound bamboo rocket ship to the moon said maggie
maggie futured that if she and three of her strongest magpie friends were to each grab hold of the corner of the rocket ship they could all fly to the moon so she tried
he was supportive of his younger daughter and showed his support by taking a nap before he fell asleep he didn't manage to say i believe rolling is a
columbus the zoo keeper said good heavens that name is a great idea no wait a second i don't understand well sir when columbus set out on his ship
what sort of nonsense is this for a young panda bear going to the moon indeed
the f wait umbrella the zoo manager laughed he walked away but didn't purchase a flash a fashionable but did purchase a fashion fashionable yellow umbrella for fred the next day
been there haven't been h enough people coming to see you in the first place i think what the zoo needs is a great is a
industry
yeah strange almost almost a magic effect on humans being which makes us want to hug and squeeze things fred fred was not allowed to actually hug the panda bears
why did a pa oh the panda
the other reason was that yo anyone who gets within three feet of a panda actually falls in love with them it's all of nature it's a law of nature a
i know i should be telling you this i shouldn't be telling you this but we might have to sell you to another family in the big zoo in san san ange sa wait in san
improve trade
and make her want to squeeze her son cheeks
wait said wouldn't would be best to ask the owl then closed his eye so maggie flew to the owl and asked f a for advice oh wise owl i have a question that i fear you can answer she said how to
many people know that pandas eat bamboo a lot of it a lot of bamboo can get quite heavy so be so because of the pandas freddy became very strong and was in terrific shape but physically fitness was not the only reason that freddy loved the pandas
she was talking to her best friend maggie the magpie magpie about going to the moon yes said one yes said the big one in the sky that that it's most like not made of cheese it's most likely not made of cheese and most certainly not made of bamboo
as for yin yin he was very proud of her an to be renamed for a famous explorer and she and maggie never stopped trying to get to the moon
obstacle it runs out was getting
into a ball and roll two days ago if i've becoming very good at it i don't think i will it would make a long time to roll there said yin yin
she could be very persuasive little bird and when she wanted
this can almost clear certainly be accounted for by this strange almost magic effect that the pandas mo that pandas
i think we'll need more magpies said maggie yes but how many more yin yin said i'm not sure exactly replied maggie the father wa
decidedly around roll roundabout way to go you must go go it t wait t'wouldn't be be best to fly wouldn't it be best to fly nonsense said mother i'm so mad i'm going to look after that lady over there and make
but the point is what he was very fond of feeding the pandas
but later fred walked into the panda panda's home under under his new ye yellow umbrella he could could think to say nonsense wait he couldn't
advertising companion fred was starting to feel the uncomfortable urge to hug a panda bear to hug the panda bear so before he ran off to hug the palm tree quickly he said it costs so much to feed panda bears i i would hate if you had to leave us after all it's the only home you know besides if you're leaving i get i'll get terribly out of shape now if you excuse me i need to squeeze some more before i scream
wait the main obstacle it it runs out was getting out of wait the main
but i just learned how to i just learned how to make myself into a ball and roll into
wait fred hugging an rather un hug cuddling cutting wait pan trees outside of the panda's home
uhm it was fred's idea so let's begin with fred fred fed the panda bears the tiger and turtle the tigers and turtles the turtles weren't so bad but as for the tigers he wasn't so sure he didn't mind handling the raw meat
yes but what does that have to do with the panda's name said the zoo manager well it seems to me sir that yin yin wanted to be a great explorer instead became a business woman
it's just that we we haven't been enough people c we haven't
further distance pandas have a strange have a have a
angeles if we don't get more money that is not it's not yeah if you don't get more it's not that you're you really aren't selling enough stuffed panda bears
yin yin was yin yin always wanted to take good advice from from her father
no how many magpie's would it take to fly around f to fly
it turns out it was getting to the rocket ship off the ground
the man
the owl instantly replied two hundred thousand and seventy six or give a or give give or take two
one two three the moon they said together pulling with the mighty i see your wings flapping that we don't seem to go anywhere said yin yin hmm heavier than i thought
so one day after fred had fed the pandas and was hugging the panda tree palm tree the zoo manager came up to him and said what is going on with yo with your pandas fred i've never seen anything like it
wait
he was re he was really try trying to find a quicker way to get to get to a a quicker way to get to get around
the pandas possess
nonsense your job is to be cute and so people want to run and g to the gift shop and buy panda bear dolls
back back in the panda's home the mother pan mother panda poo poo was very proud of her daughter after all if if it weren't for yi for yin yin they wouldn't have wouldn't have to move from their wonderful home
mmm wait since that co since that could be dangerous so all the other people at the zoo would know what the pandas had just been fed when they saw fred hu hugging an rather un cuddly palm tree wait
which young lady helps pay for the bamboo that you eat such nonsense going to the moon said her mother poo poo
this is just the type of experience wait ex this is just the type of
effect the pandas
why did a panda with the beautiful girl name yin yin have her name changed to a very un beautiful girl name columbus
he wanted to be a qui he wanted to find a quicker way wait he wanted to be a business man by but instead became a great explorer
wait magpie's started fluttering around that the zoo's profits had gone up to four thousand percent
she said spitefully an instant an an instant later a young boy was hear saying ouch momma cut that out i'm sorry said i'm sorry to say but many other little boy's cheeks have been made raw then mother poo poo was upset
how how to turn your head all the way around without getting terribly pain in your neck said the owl
yin yin and her best friend mag mag friend maggie the magpie who looked a lot like a panda would look if panda would look if pandas were birds were
a week later despite much flapping and they're still trying to get the rocketship in the air it turns out that the owl didn't take into consideration that once you get over to the over one thousand magpie together they tend to fly and can't agree on a single thing
yin yin's father moo man didn't think it was very
a week later maggie managed to round up two hundred thousand seventy eight magpie
the father watching this all through one eye for he was always had the least one eye asleep at all times s said
oh well that makes sense then said the manager did you know that since the little panda built the bamboo rocket ship those magpie's started fluttering about the zoo's
europe to get around europe europe in order to improve trade
possess but everything was not all bamboo the and hugs at the zoo more one mor f one mor one morning fred was feeding yin yin and said oh yin yin i wish that more people would come to visit the zoo
it's sis it's simple
but yin yin the younger panda bear was not listening to fred
it is interest interesting to point out at this time that more stuffed panda bears are sold at zoo gift shops then all of the other stuff animals combined
experience we need those pandas will be with us for a long time fred thought about it and said you know i think we should rename yin yin col
okay uhm pandas
he had to feed the to that he had to feed to the tigers his main objection was to being eaten
enough is of the noise nonsense said yin yin's said said enough of the nonsense said yin yin's mother poo poo
i see fred th one more thing sir about those magpies flying the pandas do you think the zoo could purchase a me a large sized umbrella
spokespeople for the panda stuffed animals stuffed animal
discussing about going to the moon her mother and father knew that they were talking about talking they were talking about since they had since they h since they hadn't thought of or talked of much else since yin yin said i want to go there and pointed to the moon
now while all this was going on do you supposed fred was doing he was fe he was feeding the pandas like he was supposed to
very proper or wise for a young panda bear to go rolling off places where there wasn't any bamboo
there were thousands of turtles all of different species all having a great time
i think that you will be a great champion for many years since turtles only get slower with age
after a few hours most of the turtles had gone a few feet all except two
except for mud of course without him we don't have a chance
said swish
then put the earplugs in his ears and couldn't hear mud's singing anymore
they all felt a little sad because they hadn't held the turtle cup in over seven hundred years
the crowd started yelling speech speech
but he doesn't want to be treated special he just wants to be normal and doesn't want everybody to hate him if he can't beat mud
the turtle cup was the trophy that the winner would take home to the village
this was the kind of thing that swish would get all the time
it would take some turtles from far away villages two whole weeks just to get there
for the first time in six hundred years i would like to present the turtle cup to blue pond the crowd went wild again
but swish wouldn't let mud scare him you're just trying to make me quit i'm not going to fall to your tricks
he was the biggest most respected and also one of the trickiest turtles there was
turtles could catch up with friends they had not seen since last festival
the slowest turtle
who is this young punk he thought to himself
by now all the turtles were just were usually way ahead of mud but this time swish had was just as slow
there were about three hundred turtles racing there were all the slowest of the slow the turtles all stretched
we all want you to look good when you bring home the cup
but then right at the end right before the sunset swish started to pull ahead of mud
when the time of the festival drew near all the turtles in the land started toward great pond
ladies and gentlemen she said mud from sludge pond has been disqualified for sleeping during the race
this was the most famous turtle there was he was the slowest turtle of all time
so one day he told his parents i don't want to race
she announced well mud it looks like you're you've done it sludge pond wins the turtle cup again
rule number two turtles all turtles must run as fast as they can and the turtle that is closest to the starting line wins
turtles arrived there was a seven day festival called the shell dwellers festival where there was lots of eating and laughing
swish's mom smiled and said i know that you can win swish but it's an honor just to get to the race said swish's mom
but though he became the greatest and biggest turtle of all time
swish started yawning he was tired from racing and thought that if
this turtle was named swish when swish was born everyone thought he was a little slow
they were both moving of course but they were so slow that it was hard to tell
then he heard the mayor said runner's please take your positions
swish made a loud gulping sound just do your best said his mom
the crowd thought he must have realized that his singing trick wasn't working but then
everyone treated swish differently
swishes father said son i have something to tell you as you know your great great grand turtle raced mud once
mud still didn't answer in fact mud was sound asleep mud had actually sung himself to sleep
we never thought of that they all said
swish was happy too but deep down i inside he knew he was just as slow as mud
sure they're nice to me now because they think i can win the race but if i lose they'll be disappointed and mad at me
when all the
it was because of swish that blue pond became the most respected pond in the land
he said turtles never cheat and i'm a turtle with honor
his name was mud and he was the greatest champion in the history of shell dweller's festival he was unbeatable
then he snapped out of it and remembered his father had warned him of his of this trick
the winner of the great turtle race was so important that he or she didn't have to move for four years until the next festival
swish was sad that he lost but all the turtles from blue pond w cheered for swish
mud said to swish there's no way that a turtle as young as you can be so slow even i was faster than your than you when you i was your age
a fat turtle in the slow turtle a fat turtle is a slow turtle
it looked like mud is still the greatest turtle of them all and when the sun went down mud was the closest turtle to the starting line
after seven days of playing and dancing and bug eating finally the day of the race came
finally after the long journey all the turtles arrived at great f pond
the crowd went wild ms tort went up to swish and gave him the turtle cup
they looked at the horizon and saw the sun was starting the rise just then the mayor said ready set slow and off they went
the mayor doctor softshell said this is ridiculous swish has to race he's the slowest turtle i've every s every seen
since turtle never cheat this is the most important rule to break this rule would mean an end to the great turtle race forever
swish saw a rock in the middle of the field and wondered how come they didn't move that big rock out of the field it seems to be in everyone's way
he always made sure that no one treated him special and that he treated everybody like he wanted to be treated like a turtle with honor
once his mother called him in for dinner and he didn't make it home until breakfast the next morning and he was only a foot away
ms tort p
swish and mud were both back at the starting line it looked as if neither of them had moved at all
look there's your cousin peek a boo from big puddle village said swish's mother you'll get uhm get to meet all sorts of new turtles
swish read the rules even though he knew them by heart
that's not a rock sweetie said his mom that's mud
mud kept singing his lullaby for a few hours but he stopped right before sunset
so with swish they thought maybe just maybe he could bring back the turtle cup to their little pond
it wo it had been in
mud didn't answer the mayor tapped mud on the shell and said hello hello mud
you have to remember that even though he's gifted at being slow he's very very young said swish's father
he gave mud such a close race
all the extra attention made swish very uncomfortable he thought
there were many legends about him it was the it was rumored he was so slow his heart would only beat once a day
swish took the cup that day for the first time he would take it many more times after that
swish was suddenly very excited he told his mom you know what i'm going to win this race
it would be that it would be nice to just listen to mud's sweet voice and fall asleep
everything about the festival was fun but the main event was the great turtle race
every four years turtles
he hadn't
mud knew that this would be his closest race ever and he was actually getting a little bit scared
dirty tricks then he whispered in swish's ear all the tricks that his great great grand turtle taught him
ms snapper would say hi swishy do you want some yummy pie to fill you up and slow you down for the big race
oh no shouted the fans mud's winning
and thought really slow thoughts as they did the sky turned ba turned from black to dark blue
swish had to be carried on his father's back since it would have taken him months to get to the great pond by himself
this means that we have a new champion the real winner is swish softbelly of blue pond
rule number three no turtle may pretend to be going fast but going go slow instead all turtle must go as fast as they can at all times
all the turtles in blue pond held a meeting to discuss the problem
this time it was a bit closer than you would have liked it
but he got a li a little older and tur the turtles began to realize that swish was really really really slow
much greater or bigger than mud
posted the t rules of the race on the tree for everyone to see
after six hours mud and s swish were still tied and had only moved a few inches
the slowest turtles from each pond were carried to the starting line by members of their village
he wasn't as slow as you but he did teach about mud's
for example mister peeks the local shell cleaner would say hey there swish you want a free shell waxing today
sludge pond for over fifty years because no one could ever beat their turtle
the town agreed to treat swish like a normal person and after a while swish decided that he would be proud to to race for his village
they read rule number one the great race begins at sunrise and ends at sunset
the mayor of pondland went to present the turtle cup to sludge pond again
i never promised that i would win the race i can't beat mud anyway i heard once it took him three days just to yawn
then mud tried another trick he started singing a soft beautiful lullaby
when mud was in his prime there was a new turtle born in blue pond
he would never lose the turtle cup for the rest of his long life
i know it and all these turtles will know that blue pond rules i'm not afraid of stupid mud
he reached in his shell and and pulled out a couple of earplugs
blue pond was a nice village located about three days crawl from great pond
the less a turtle moves the bigger they get and the longer they live so you can see winning the great the great race is a great honor
what would you like to say to all the turtles at the festival
from all over the land would crawl to great pond
they were very proud
mister peeks would never do anything for free but he was going to give swish a free shell waxing
you're cheating you're going to ruin the great race forever
he hadn't had to move for over fifty years
the mayor of great pond
ms snapper was never nice to anyone but she was nice to s swish
all the turtles were very very slow so it took t took some time before anyone figured out which turtles was the slowest
this was swish's first ever shell dwellers festival and he thought it was the most wonderful thing he had ever seen
she said swish you were the youngest winner of the great turtle race that was the most exciting finish we've ever had
rule number four no turtle may fall asleep since if you are asleep you aren't running as fast as you can
i'll bet
or even his new flute he started shaking the flute to get the flies off the
dancing to music they couldn't hear
it worked doctor john was a town hero doctor wong was the town hero
john thought it was an ok idea
in the little town of franksville what should they do they couldn't keep john in jail and they didn't want to kick him out of the town because all
then suddenly a fly landed on a little girl then the fly landed on someone else
take the good with the bad because as bad as the sou as
look john
doctor wong thought for for a second then pronounced
their problems started when they ran out of water thankfully someone was digging a hole and found water
when the townsfolk heard the noise they couldn't even swat at the flies anymore
it was very upset he was very upset at first then he said oh well good thing i brought my old flute as back up
he wasn't called rooster john he wasn't called rooster john yet that came later
oh no said chief sanders just when things were going good in franksville
oh no said
oh that's a nice instrument but it's just not the flute
from then on john would wake up at sunrise like a rooster and play to keep the flies away
the local scientist doc doctor wong came up with an idea he thought that if he made a new mouthpiece especially shaped for john's mouth then perhaps he could play the flute normally
he played many musical instruments such as the guitar the tuba the piano and the clarinet however for some reasons the way his mouth was shaped made his flute sound awful
the flies away
cl cleaner and no one had any cavities
but just then a ma a man moved in town who played the flute so badly that people would run away screaming
and accidentally smashed it into pieces
the people in the town decided to have a great big parade in franksville to celebrate the fact
the bad flute player was rooster john
well i'm sure you guessed that didn't work no one could hear anything people were getting into car accidents and
bad as the flute sounded it was a lot better than thousands of flies crawling on them
i've heard you play the clarinet you're quite good why don't you play that instead ch said chief sanders
windows were breaking and all the cows in the town started to make sour milk
it's the flute sound the flies hate john's flute playing as much as we do john the dentist drives away
besides everybody loved john since he had become the town dentist everybody's teeth so were much whiter and
then that the people of franksville ville realized that they would have to take a good
they had to cover their ears from the horrible sound the flies would land all over the people and they couldn't swat them off it was gross then suddenly the flies flew away fast as they could
f franksville is was a town that seemed to have one problem after another
john didn't know what to do so he kept playing his flute the flies were annoying so he wouldn't so he would swat at them with his hands
and everybody looked really silly at dances
i even wrote a song chief sanders it's called cops and robbers
and guess what
we can't let you play the flute anymore john said the police chief said police chief s sanders the neighbors are complaining that the cats and dogs are trying to chew off their ears
so there was a problem
everyone cheered
the flute sounded normal and it turned out john could play quite well
but there was an echo in the well that made the flute sound louder
then some some landed on a bunch of people pretty soon there were tons of flies
cause they all had such nice teeth so they decided that john could play the flute and everybody else would wear would have to wear earplugs
still it's not as bad as millions of f flies i suppose
they just couldn't lead a normal life
he was an excellent dentist
but soon after they started to get fleas they got tons and tons of fleas flies and
but they couldn't keep john in jail since he wasn't wasn't really breaking any laws so there was nothing the police could do
maybe a poorly played flute doesn't sound that bad but just try to imagine some scratching someone scratching on a chalkboard with a fork
he was
before i tell you how rooster john got his name you should know a little bit about the town of franksville
no no please don't play your old flute big begged doctor wong but it was too late john had started playing
as we
it was
they were up on the main float the big band played as they marched down the s d up and down main street
rooster john
tons of flies were landing on everyone before they knew it the town was filled with flies again
then they decided to lower him down
but his real love was music
that for once there was no water problem no fly problem and no flute problem doctor wong and john were star were the stars of the parade
then the flies stopped
and then multiply that times by that times a hundred that's how the flute sounded when this guy played it i'm serious
but i have i have to play i was born to do it i don't know why but i feel like i have to or else bad things will happen
the new town dentist
then he played the song the police chief hated the sound so much he threw john in jail
a well and let him play down where no one could hear him
so it didn't take very long
so
to go to the bathroom so much but it was
i got my new high score
the flying
lights
and wanted to play go fish
that it wasn't r
to help other passengers
to
she
since i
there wasn't
so i started to yell
just to eat a banana split with grandpa
but
ha
we were going to
but sometimes people let
it was boring
how
but i
were making
there's no way that anyone
without my parents
the airplane ride
said she had a s surprise i thought
that there were like
i also
but it did
and i can
he thought i was
even
i've
me that
one thing
tried to push the button
i told her
and eat peanuts
the tallest and
go fish with me
e even though we are on the ground
would like a banana split
and you can be a pilot then
would come but
from new york to texas
if she couldn't get me banana split i wouldn't have
parents the most
her fault
then jennifer came up to me and said
up so the flight attendant

the cockpit i thought awesome
he laughed every even though i was joking
anyone next to me the person next to
my moth
go fishing
in the overhead head thingy
yellow purple and black ones
like to eat peanuts on their banana splits
hard it would be to work all those million
told her that i
any mountain and you
at all and i had to
one
in the first place
when i missed my
she s said
i was pretty nervous
she kept trying to give me
the peanuts that
and knobs and stuff
a million buttons and levers
cool looking dragons to keep me busy
had already seen
the flight attendant seemed
she told me to call her jennifer instead
he once played the game i had on my game boy and
about being by yourself on an airplane
the button that let
like to
he said how was your flight and i said someday
in case the pilot was bored
and go to the ba to the bathroom
cause it was the tallest
she said that she had
without my parents there
that the plane is going
but it was
i was glad that
i was so short sh
way i figured it was
was in the air i was
finally we landed that's
i'll
jennifer took me into the cockpit
flight attendants
i said if you can't get past level one
said the captain was inviting me to
it to catch up to the red blue
i'm much better at pushing buttons than you are
hey peanut lady hey peanut lady
be quiet
only ha
know how anyone
i had a game boy in my backpack my backpack was
wasn't really that hard once you practiced
you go higher than
the flight attendant gave me a deck of cards
i only used
me so thirsty
can remember to push all those buttons at the right time
help it that's
it was very scary i didn't know anyone
i was going there
re for some reason
always thought
the first time i ever took a
from some
grandpa laughed and then took
would make a great pilot someday if i wanted to be
get my game boy
a coloring book of
and i can't
i tried to watch the movie but i
we might crash i didn't
that it was
when i got off the airplane there was grandpa waiting for me
brought my deck of cards
but to tell the truth
instead
great more peanuts
once the plane
and the
to go the bathroom so much
me straight to the ice cream shop
have to go to the bathroom eight times
i could
guess what
so from
that's always scary because
and that w where
only serve banana splits on my plane
are very nice to you
me would have been very annoyed
she didn't like being called peanut lady but
he said
she did
and watch a movie
had five buttons
my mom gave me
i started thinking
i
then he told me
it seems like everything
go faster than a car any car
an but she wouldn't play
millions of buttons
the green crayon because
and that
we are going to crash
go all the way
wouldn't
i had seven cola's and four ginger ale's which made me
to see my grandfather
she told me to
my game boy
they don't have any banana splits on the plane
i guess it was because the plane was so loud and i didn't
peanuts
flying was fun
imagine how
and i thought wow look at all those buttons then i thought
think about that but i di couldn't
and ride by myself in
a little annoyed that i had
he was really nice but he wouldn't play go fish with me
i played on my game boy until i
i colored the dragon pictures all green
get past level three
th that one
i'm going to be a pilot and i
is that
couldn't even pass level one
too fast
it wasn't peanuts it was something really cool
and i wanted
the pilot told me
it was worth the whole trip
pretty good
s
be a pilot too
to i was to short to reach the button
the slowest turtle
you can see winning the great race is a great honor
and as they did n did the sky turned from black to dark blue
mud knew that this would be his closest race ever and he was actually getting a bit scared of swish kid of this swish kid
you have
they were very proud he gave mud such a close race
rule number four no turtle may fall asleep since if you are asleep you aren't running as fast as you can
swish's mom smiled and said i know that you can win swish but we'll be proud of you even if you don't win
swish took the cup that day for the first time
blue pond was located about three days crawl from the great pond
then mud tried another trick
he thought it was the most wonderful thing he had ever saw
it was rumored
they looked at the horizon and saw the sun was starting the rise just then the mayor said ready set slow and off they went
after seven days of playing and dancing and bug eating finally the day of the race came
all the all the extra attention made swish very uncomfortable
mud kept singing his lullaby for a few hours but he stopped right before sunset
all the turtles in big blue pond in blue pond held a meeting to discuss the problem
turtles could catch up with friends they had not seen since the last festival
ms tort went up to swish and gave him the turtle cup
even i was faster than you when i was your age you're cheating you're going to ruin the great race forever
this turtle was named swish
when the time of the festival drew near all the turtles in the land started toward great pond
imagine he hadn't had to move for fifty years
and after a while swish decided that he would be proud to race for his village
the slowest turtles from each pond were carried to the starting line by members of their villages
that's not a rock sweetie said his mom that's mud
he would never lose the turtle cup for the rest of his long life
i swish was suddenly very excited
it looked as if neither of them had moved at all
they read rule number one the great race begins at sunrise and ends at sunset
oh no shouted the fans mud mud's winning it looks like mud is still the greatest turtle of them all
it would t it would take some turtles from far away villages two whole weeks just to get there
his name was mud and he was the greatest champion in the history of shell dwellers festival he was unbeatable
the turtle cup was in sludge pond for over fifty years that's because no one could ever beat the turtle from there
he was tired from racing but racing and thought that it would be ni be nice j to just listen to mud's sweet voice and fall asleep
everyone treated swish differently for example mister peeks the local shell cleaner would say
to remember that even though he's gifted he's still very young said swish's father
the mayor of pondland went to present the turtle cup to sludge pond again
then he heard the mayor say runner's please take your positions
swish saw a big rock in the middle of the big festival and wondered about it
so with swish they thought maybe just maybe he could bring back the turtle cup
mud from sludge pond has been disqualified for sleeping during the race
but after a few hours most of the turtles had gone a few feet except two
the mayor of great pond mrs tort passed the rules of the race to everyone for to see
uh i never promised that i would win the race i can't beat mud anyway
but then right at the end right before the sunset swish started to pull ahead of mud
but without him we don't have a chance
the winner of the great turtles race was so important that he or she didn't have to move for four years until the next festival
i know it
i think that you'll be a great champion for many years since turtles only get slower with age
you're just trying to make me quit i'm not going to fall for your tricks he said
but as he got a little older the turtles began to realize that swish was really really really slow
finally after the long journey all the turtles arrived at th at great pond
mud didn't answer the mayor tapped mud on the shell and said hello hello mud
you know my grandfather raced mud once he wasn't as slow as you but he did teach me a thing or two
mrs snapper was never nice to anyone but she was being nice to swish
they were all the slowest of slow
swish's father said son don't worry about it
after six hours mud and swish were still tied and had only moved a few inches
rule number three no turtle may pretend to be going as fast as they can but go slow instead
every four years turtle from all over the land would crawl to great to great pond
he thought to himself
he was was so slow his heart would only beat once a day
the turtle cup was a trophy that the winner would take home to their village
swish started yawning
who is this young punk
swish read the rules even though he knew them by heart
swish was happy t but but deep down inside he knew he was just as slow as mud
mostly s nice turles lived in blue pond but they all felt a little sad because they hadn't held the turtle cup in over seven hundred years
he started singing a soft beautiful lullaby
it's an honor just to ra to get to race said swish's mom
he would take it many more times after that
all the turtles were very very slow so it took some time before anyone could figure out which turtles were the slowest
there were thousands of turtles many different species all having a great time
ladies and gentlemen said ms tort
surely they are nice to me now because they think i can win the race but if i lose they'll be disappointed and mad at me
the crowd thought he must have realized that it wasn't working
everything about the festival was fun but the main event was the great turtle race
swish was sad
the mayor doctor softshell said this is ridiculous swish has to race he's the slowest turtle i've every seen except for mud of course
but swish wouldn't let mud scare him
when swish was born everyone thought he was a little slow
she said swish you are the youngest winner of the great turtle race that was the most exciting finish we've ever had
he was the biggest most respected and one of the trickiest turtles in history
what would you like to say to all the turtles at the festival the crowd started yelling speech speech
swish had to be carried on his father's back since it would have taken him months to get to great pond by himself
he put the earplugs in
mr snapper would say hi swishy do you want some yummy pie to fill you up and slow you down for the big race a fat turtle is a slow turtle
he always made sure that no one treated him special and that he treated everybody like he wanted to be treated like a turtle with honor
there were about three hundred turtles racing
swish made a loud gulp sound
but though he became the greatest and biggest turtle of all time much greater or bigger than mud
they were both moving of course oh of course but they were s so slow that it h was hard to tell
he told his mom you know what i'm going to win this race i know
rule number two all turtles must run as fast as they can and the turtle that is closest to the starting line wins
when all the turtles arrived there was a seven day festival called the shell dwellers festival where there was lots of eating and laughing
and when the sun went down mud was the closest to the starting line
so one day he told his parents i don't want to race
mud said to swish there's there's no way that a turtle as young as you can be so slow
when mud was in his prime there was a new turtle born in blue pond
he was the slowest turtle of all time
this time it was a bit closer than you would have liked i'll bet
then he snapped out of it and remembered his father told him about this trick ga trick gave him earplugs
hey there swish do you want a free shell waxing today we all want you to go to look good when you bring home the cup
we never thought of that they agreed then the town agreed to treat swish like a normal turtle
she announced well mud it looks like you've done you've done it sludge pond wins the turtle cup again
how can how come they don't move that big rock out of the field it seems to be in everyone's way said swish
it was because of swish that blue pond became the most respected pond in the land
swish and mud were both back at the starting line
look there's your cousin peek a boo from big puddle village said swish's mother you'll get to meet all sorts of new turtles
this means that we have a new champion the real winner is swish softbelly of blue pond the crowd went wild
i heard once it took him three days just to yawn
the rules were nailed to a tree to to a tree for all to see
the less a turtle moves the bigger they get and the longer they live so you can see
since turtles never cheat this is the most important rule to break this rule would mean an end to the great turtle race forever
but he doesn't want to be treated special he just wants to be normal and he doesn't want everybody to hate him if he can't beat mud
that he had that he lost but all the turtles from blue pond cheered for swish
once his mother called him for dinner and he didn't make it home until breakfast the next morning and he was only a foot away
turtles never cheat and i'm a turtle with honor
and all these turtles will know that blue pond rules i'm not afraid of stupid mud
for the first time in six hundred years i would like to present the turtle cup to blue pond the crowd went wild again
there were many legends about him
this was swish's first ever shell dwellers festival
mud still didn't answer in fact mud was sound asleep mud had actually sung himself to sleep
mister peeks would never do anything for free but he was going to give swish a free shell waxing
his ears and couldn't hear mud's singing anymore
then he told swish about all of the mud's dirty tricks so that swish would be ready for them
the turtles all stretched and thought really slow thoughts
by now all the turtles were way ahead of mud but this time swish was just as slow
all turtle must go as fast as they can at all times
dear mom and dad parents
oh sure it's easy to say that i should have just picked the cat up but sometimes we don't always think all that great under pressure
also i was going to sell the cat fur and buy my sister jenny braces for her big stupid face
so in conclusion i'm getting hungry and i'm sorry for shaving the cat
so she just ignored me see she's not so responsible after all
you should be proud of me for thinking so fast on my toes
last night i saw that she didn't brush her teeth oh yeah i forgot to tell you that
poor kitty this and poor kitty that it's your fault really
plus oscar my turtle told me to shave the cat
cats aren't always nice just like my sister jenny isn't always nice
i was afraid you wouldn't let me practice on my own head can i practice by shaving jenny's head
i really didn't mean to shave the cat really i swear
so i thought that if i could shave the cat a lot of of bun a bunch of times her hair would grow back harder each time and soon she would have an invincible coat of cat fur armor
instead the cat came into my room because jenny never plays with it enough
i just didn't want to see the cat getting all hot and uncomfortable and stuff
plus if you weren't always cuddling with my sister so much maybe she would have been with her cat
so it was really my father's day gift to him
you guys never liked oscar as much as the cat anyway
i would like to start by saying that i think that you are very mean to make me do this because it wasn't even my fault
that's the last time i ever shave the cat to protect any stupid gerbils
she made us shave something for science ask her
ps if you would've bought her a turtle i couldn't have shaved it
i don't have to get good grades to know that you should teach a cat to shave itself
i think that she should brush her teeth twice tonight that's just my opinion though
dear mom don't let dad know that the real reason i shaved the cat was that he's always sneezing around it
i knew our cat would grow her fur back but some cats don't have hair
turtles don't do anything except poke their heads out and not be not cuddly
actually the truth is that i by accident turned on the nose hair clippers and the cat was being chased by the turtle and ran right by the clippers and shaved herself
i saw the cat was trying to get the gerbils and you told us we couldn't hit animals so i didn't know what else to do
she's so good at school and you bought her a cat cause she's just so responsible and stuff
i think it really liked its haircut
but so what if it's winter
it keeps hitting me on the shell and trying to roll me over when you leave the room
since you have grounded me and told me to write down why i am sorry before i was allowed out of my room i am mad at you
and you know what those stupid gerbils didn't even thank me they just ran on that stupid wheel and did stupid things
although you can see that it's really jenny's fault for not being as responsible as you always say and not brushing her teeth
plus i forgot to tell you that you should be blaming ms casper my science teacher
if i had a cat i know i would teach it not shave itself that's for sure
dear mom and dad jenny didn't brush her teeth last night
fine oscar can't really talk but if he could he would have said please shave the cat
dad please don't read the next part
how come jenny gets a cat and i get a stupid turtle anyway
but the real reason i shaved the cat was to make a wig for those poor hair less cats that we saw on tv on the animal channel
ok here's what happened as i remember it
i promise that i'll do a better job then i did on the cat cause now i have what dad calls life experience not that i shaved the cat though
then she would be a super cat and you could take her on tv shows and get lots of money so that you can send jenny to college even if she is a dumb little tattle tale
you guys will probably say you guys will just probably say it's winter danny cats don't overheat in winter
the cat liked being shaved anyway so i don't see the big deal
i couldn't buy him anything nice since you took away my allowance for when i shaved the neighbor's dog
you wouldn't always take the cat's side if you knew the stuff he did to my poor turtle
i couldn't help it anyway it was an accident and i didn't even do it on purpose
i was afraid to tell you the real reason i shaved the cat was that i want to be a barber and i needed practice
she said that when we shave hair it grows back harder and sometimes even darker
besides the real reason i shaved the cat was to keep it nice and cool
sincerely danny
i'll bet you didn't know something else did you know that i wanted to be a barber
i know how much you hate him sneezing and stuff so i thought if i got rid of his fur he wouldn't sneeze and that you'd have a better marriage
can i get a dog please
they are all hairless cat they are called hair less cats and they need fur in the winter sometimes i think i swear that's the reason
so i grabbed dad's nose hair clippers and shaved it
i kept saying no kitty no don't shave yourself but my stupid sister never taught her cat how to listen
just cause she's a good student doesn't mean she's really responsible
i mean it'll be summer soon enough and i just wanted the cat to get used to the idea before it gets got really hot
the only reason it hasn't come out for two weeks is because you guys keep making such a big deal about it
no one could blame fred really since no one really wants to be eaten
the panda
well sir when columbus set out on his ship he was really trying to find a quicker way to get around europe in order to improve trade he wanted to be a business man but instead became a great explorer
so maggie flew to the owl asked for his advice
but he was supportive of his young daughter and showed support by taking a nap
yes but what does that have to do with the pandas man said the zoo keep manager
now while all this was going on what do you suppose fred was doing why he was feeding the pandas like he was supposed to
the main obstacle it turns out was getting the rocket ship off the ground
this can almost certainly be accounted for by the strange almost magical effect that the pandas possess
i think that the zoo needs a great advertising campaign
such nonsense going to the moon said her mother poo poo
for fred when it came to the pandas he had a warm spot in his heart
yin yin and her best friend maggie the magpie who looked a lot like a panda would look would look if pandas were birds were discussing about going to the moon
fred fed the panda bears the tigers and the turtles
as at futher distances pandas have a strange almost magical effect on human beings which makes us want to hug and squeeze things
the owl instantly replied two hundred thousand and seventy six give or take two
i'm sorry to say but many a boy little boy's cheeks have been made raw when mother poo poo panda was upset
back at the panda's home the mother panda poo poo was very proud of her daughter after all if it weren't for yin yin they would have had to move from their wonderful home
like it or not we are spokespeople for the panda stuffed animal industry which young lady helps pay for the bamboo that you eat
this is just the type of exposure we needed those pandas will be with us for a long time
hmm heavier than i thought i think we'll need more magpies said maggie
i know i shouldn't be telling you this but we might have to sell you and your family to the big zoo in san san angeles if we don't get more money
why did a panda with the beautiful girl name yin yin have her name changed to the very un beautiful girl name columbus
but physical fitness was not only the only reason that fred loved the pandas
besides if you leave i'll get terribly out of shape now if you excuse me i need to squeeze something before i scream
nonsense said the mother i'm so mad i'm going to look at the lady over there and make her want to squeeze her son cheeks she said spitefully
i see fred one more thing sir about those magpies flying above the pandas do you think that the zoo could purchase me a large sized umbrella
it's simple econ economics
it's taken me a couple of weeks to figure it out but i think yin yin wants to go to the moon and the magpies want to take her there said fred
one two three to the moon they said together pulling with all their might
one morning fred was feeding yin yin and said oh yin yin i wish that more people would come and visit the zoo
fred was starting to feel the uncontrollable urge to hug the panda so before he ran off to hug the palm tree he quickly said
i'm not sure exactly replied maggie
i don't think it will take that long to roll there said yin yin
there were three pandas and they were known as the pan family
enough of this nonsense said yin yin's mother poo poo what sort of nonsense is this for a young panda bear going to the moon indeed moon indeed
he didn't mind handling the raw meat he had to feed th to the tigers
and less than a week later yin yin and maggie had built a rocket ship out of bamboo
so all the other people in the zoo would know that the pandas had just been fed when they saw fred hugging the rather uncuddly palm tree outside the pandas home
as for yin yin she was very proud to be renamed after a famous explorer and she and maggie never stopped trying to get to the moon
fred thought about it and said you know i think we should rename yin yin columbus
some people do like to bite their finger nails but fred wasn't a nail biter so being eaten was definitely not something he looked forward to
so because of the pandas fred became very strong and was in terrific shape
oh wise owl i have a question that i fear only you can answer she said
after all it's only home you know it's the only home you know
well it seems to me sir that yin yin wanted to be a great explorer instead of a business woman
many people know the that pandas eat bamboo a lot of it and a lot of bamboo can get quite heavy
but before he fell asleep he did manage to say i believe rolling is decidedly round about way to go if you must go t'would be nice to be it t'would be best to fly
so one day after fred had fed the pandas and was hugging the palm tree the zoo manager came up to him and said what is going on with your panda fred i've never seen anything like it
your job is to be cute so people want to run to the gift shop and buy panda bear dolls
but everything was not all bamboo and hugs at the zoo
maggie figured if she and the three of her strongest magpie friends were to each grab hold of a corner of the rocket ship they could all fly to the moon so they tried
actually it was eighty five point five degree spot on his left kidney but the point was that he was very fond of feeding the pandas
but i just learned how to make myself into a ball and roll two days ago and i've become very and i'm becoming very good at it
the turtles weren't so bad but as for the tigers he wasn't so sure
her mother and father knew what they were talking about since they hadn't thought or talked of much else since yin yin said i want to go there and pointed to the moon
fred was not allowed to actually hug the panda bears since that could be dangerous
a week later maggie managed to round up two hundred thousand seventy eight magpie she could be very persuasive little bird if she wanted
but later when fred walked into the panda's home under a his new yellow umbrella all she could think was to say was nonsense
yin yin has was always one to take good advice from her father
yes but how many more yin yin said
it's not that you aren't selling enough stuffed panda bears it's just that you haven't been there haven't been enough people coming to see you in the first place
fred wait each afternoon at three o'clock when it was time to feed the tigers
it was fred's idea so let's begin with fred
yes the big one in the sky that is most likely not made of cheese and most certainly not made of bamboo
the other reason was that anyone who gets within three feet of a panda automatically falls in love with them it's a law of nature
no how many magpie's would be needed to fly a four hundred pound panda bear to and a one hundred pound bamboo rocket ship to the moon said maggie
but yin yin the young panda was not listening to fred she was talking to her best friend maggie the magpie about going to the moon
an instant later a young boy heard was heard saying ouch mom cut that out
oh well that makes sense then said the manager did you know that since the little panda built that bamboo rocket ship those magpie's started fluttering about and the zoo's profits have gone up four thousand percent
i see your wings flapping but we don't seem to be going anywhere said yin yin
the father watching this all through one eye for he always had at least one eye uhm one eye asleep at all times said t'would be best to ask the owl then closed his eye
it costs so much to feed you panda bears i would ha i w i would hate if you had to leave us
there were they were in order of cuteness yin yin the younger daughter poo poo the mother and moo man the gentle and always sleepy father
yin yin's father moo man didn't think it was very proper or wise for a young panda bear to go rolling off to places where there wasn't any bamboo
his main objection was be to being eaten
it turns out that the owl didn't take into consideration that once you get over a thousand magpie together they tend to fight and can't agree on a single thing
nonsense
it's interesting to point out at this time that more stuffed panda bears are sold at zoo gift shops than all of the other stuffed animals combined
bamboo is very workable substance and pandas tend to handle bamboo a lot so this in itself was not that astonishing at least to yin yins parents fred sure was impressed though
a week later despite much flapping they were still trying to get the rocket in the air
the zoo keeper said good heavens th that is a great idea no wait a second i don't understand
rooster john
he was the new town dentist
they even w were up on the main float
so they decided that john could play the flute and everybody else would have to wear earplugs
it's the flute sound the flies hate john's flute playing and as much as we do
he was very upset at first then he said oh well good thing i brought my old flute as a back up
windows were breaking and all the cows in town started to make sour milk
they got tons and tons of flies
that's how the flute sounded when the guy played it i'm serious
and guess what what it worked
besides everybody loved john
we can't let you play the flute anymore john said police chief sanders
and everybody looked really silly at dances dancing to music they couldn't hear
thankfully someone was digging a hole and found water
but before they knew it the town was filled with flies again
from then on john would wake up at sunrise just like a rooster to play to play to keep the flies away
they had to cover their ears from the horrible sound
he thought that if he made a new mouthpiece especially shaped for john's mouth then perhaps he could play the flute normally
maybe a poorly maybe a poorly played flute doesn't sound all that bad
but they couldn't keep john in jail since he really since he wasn't really breaking any laws
however for some reason the way his mouth was shaped the m made his flute sound awful
franksville is a town that seemed to have one problem after the other
then suddenly a fly landed on the little girl then the fly landed on someone else then some landed on a bunch of people
then it was the then the people of franksville realized that they would have to take the good with the bad
he played the song the police chief hated the sound so much that he threw john in jail
john had started playing
he thought that if uhm
the bad the bad flute player was rooster john
the people in the town decided to have a great big parade in franksville to celebrate the fact for once that there was no water problem no fly problem and no flute problem
so there was no problem in a little in the little town of franksville
but i have to play i was born to do it i don't know why but i feel like i have to or else bad things will happen
the flies were annoying so he would swat at them with his hand or even his new flute
and they decided to lower him down a well and let him play there where no one down there where no one c down where no one could hear him
it was gross then suddenly the flies flew away fast as they could
the flies stopped just a bit and then a man moved into town who played a f who played the flute so badly that people would run away screaming
he played many musical instruments such as the guitar the tuba the piano and the clarinet
before i tell you about h how rooster john got his name you should know a little bit about the town of franksville
a big band played as they marched up and down main street everyone cheered
he was an excellent dentist but his real love was music
john the dentist is driving the flies away
since i'm sure you guessed that didn't work
no no please don't play your old flute begged doctor wong but it was too late
oh that's a that's a nice instrument but it's not the flute i even wrote you a song chief sanders it's called cops and robbers
the local dentist doctor scientist doctor wong came up with an idea
doctor wong was the town hero the flute sounded normal and turned out john could play it quite well
still that's not that's not as bad as million flies of flies millions of flies i suppose
since he had become the town dentist everyone's teeth were much whiter and cleaner no one had any cavities
john didn't know what what just kept to do so he just kept on playing his flute
the neighbors are complaining and the cats and dogs are trying to chew off their ears
but soon after they
they r they couldn't they couldn't they just couldn't lead a normal life
oh no said chief sanders when things were just going good for franksville
the flies would land all over the people and they couldn't swat them off
but just try to imagine someone scratching a chalkboard with a fork and then multiply that times a hundred
there was nothing the police could do
their problems started when they ran out of water
pretty soon tons of flies were landing on everyone
no one could hear anything people were getting into car accidents
when the townsfolk heard the noise they couldn't even swat the flies anymore
doctor wong and john were the stars of the parade
he wasn't called rooster john yet but that came later
doctor wong thought f thought for a second and then pronounced
what should they do they couldn't keep john in jail and they didn't want to to kick him out of town because they all had such nice t nice teeth
he started shaking the flute to get the flies off and accidentally s smashed it into pieces
look john i've heard you play the clarinet you're quite good why don't you play that instead said chief sanders
after that s they started to get flies
john thought that it was an ok idea but there was an echo in the well that made the flute sound louder
thinking we might crash
the first time i ever took an airplane by myself it was fun and scary
but it did
then jennifer came up to me and said she had a surprise i thought great more peanuts
when i got off the airplane there was grandpa waiting for me he said how was your flight
i said if you can't get past level one
she said they don't have any banana banana splits on the plane but sometimes people like to eat peanuts on their banana splits
we are going to crash
wait
but the plane is going to
she didn't like being called peanut lady
i didn't like to think about that but i couldn't help it that's when i missed my parents the most
one thing about being by yourself on an airplane
you go higher than any mountain and you go faster than any car
i tried to watch the movie
jennifer took me into the cockpit pit and there
it was worth the whole trip just to eat a banana split with grandpa
he was really nice but he wouldn't play go fish with me
imagine how hard it would be to work all those millions of buttons and eat peanuts and go to the bathroom
finally we landed
so i started yelling hey peanut lady hey peanut lady
oh i started thinking we might crash
i was glad that there wasn't anyone next to me
because it was the tallest and i wanted it to catch up to the red brown blue yellow purple and black ones
i was going there to see my grandfather we were going to go fishing
she said the captain was inviting me to see the cockpit i thought awesome
and i'll only serve banana splits on my plane
he laughed even though i wasn't joking
and that if she would
the way i figured it my game boy
which made me have to go to the bathroom eight times
is going too fast to ever stop
she told me to call her jennifer instead
my mom gave me a coloring book of cool looking dragons to keep me busy i colored the dragon pictures all green so it didn't take very long
and i h
for some reason she kept trying to give me peanuts
suddenly i thought wow look at all of those buttons
i had seven cola's and four ginger ale's by the time
i guess it was because the plane was so loud and i didn't know anyone
the flight attendant gave me a deck of cards but she wouldn't play go fish with me
that's always scary because it seems like even though you are
then he told me that he once played a game
on the ground
i didn't know anyone at all and had to go all the way from new york to texas without my parents
i said someday i'm going to be a pilot
it was
but it wasn't peanuts it was something really cool
i told her that it was the peanuts that were making me so thirsty in the first place
and you can be a pilot then i could be a pilot too since i'm much better at pushing buttons than you are
i had a game boy in my backpack my backpack was in the overhead thingy
f
once the plane was in the air i was pretty good
but she did get me my game boy
even the flight attendant seemed a little annoyed that i had to go to the bathroom so much but it was her fault
is that the flight attendants are very nice to you
and there were like a million buttons and levers and knobs and stuff
but i had already seen that one so it was boring
but to tell you the truth without my parents there i was pretty nervous
finally we landed
the pilot told me that it wasn't really that hard once you practiced
that's always scary because it seems like even though we were
the person next to me would have been very annoyed
she told me to be quiet and watch the movie
i've always thought flying was fun
grandpa laughed then took me straight to the ice cream shop
i also brought my deck of cards in case the pilot was bored and wanted to play go fish
get me a banana split i wouldn't have to go the bathroom so much
he said he thought i would make a great pilot someday if i wanted to be
only has five buttons and i can't get past level three
i tried to push the button that lights up so the flight attendant would come but guess what i was too short to reach the button
i only used the green crayon because
i played on my game boy until i got my new high score
but i told her that i would like a banana split instead
i had on my game boy and he couldn't even pass level one
then i thought there's no way that anyone can remember to push all those buttons at the right time
she said that she had to help other passengers
we are on the ground
i was starting
we were on the
that the plane is going too fast to ever stop
the airplane ride
for fred when it came to the pandas he had a warm spot in his heart
which young lady helps pay for the bamboo that you eat
it's not that you aren't selling enough stuffed panda bears it's just that there haven't been enough people coming to see you in the first place i think what the zoo needs is a great advertising campaign
i see your wings flapping but we don't seem to be going anywhere said yin yin
yes but what does that have to do with the pandas ma pandas man said the zoo manager
it is interesting to po to point out that this time that more stuffed panda bears are sold at the zoo gift shops then all of the other stuff animals combined
she said spitefully an instant later the young boy was heard saying ouch mom cut that out i'm sorry to say but many a little boy's cheeks have been made raw when mother poo poo panda was upset
a week later maggie managed to round up two hundred thousand and seventy eight magpie
the panda
but later when fred walked into the panda's home under a his new yellow umbrella all she could think to say was nonsense
actually it was eighty five point five degree spot on his left kidney but the point is that he was very fond of feeding the pandas
he wanted to be a business man but instead became a great explorer
oh oh well that makes sense then the man manager said did you know that since the little panda built that bamboo rocket ship and those magpie's started fluttering about that the zoo's profits have gone up four thousand percent
i don't think it will take that long to roll there said yin yin
so then itself was not that astonishing
now while all this was going on what do you supposed fred was doing why he was feeding the pandas like he was supposed to
the turtles weren't so bad but as for the tigers he wasn't so sure
nonsense
san angeles
a lot of bamboo can can get quite heavy so because of the pandas fred became very strong and was in terrific shape but physical fitness was not the only reason that fred loved the pandas
yin yin's father moo man didn't think it was very proper or wise for a young panda bear to go rolling off to places where there wasn't any bamboo but he was supportive of his young daughter and showed his support by make taking a nap
those panda will sh those pandas
the father watching this all through one eye for he had always had at least one eye asleep at all times
yin yin was always one to take good advice from her father and less than a week later yin yin and maggie had built a rocket ship out of bamboo
her mother and father knew what they were talking about since they hadn't thought or talked much of else since yin yin said i want to go there and pointed to the moon
a week later despite much flapping they were still trying and to get the rocket in the air
it was fred's idea so let's begin with fred
i know i shouldn't be telling you this but we might have to sell you and your other and your family to the big zoo in san
they were in order of cuteness yin yin the young daughter poo poo the mother moo and moo man the gentle always sleepy father
to hug the palm tree quickly said it costs so much to feed you panda bears i would hate if you had to leave us a after all it's the only home you know
fred thought about it and said you know i think w we should rename yin yin columbus but the zookeeper said good heavens man that is a great idea no wait a second i don't understand
how do you turn your head all the way around without getting a terrible pain in your neck said owl
back in the panda's home the mother panda poo poo was very proud of her daughter
said what's going on with your pandas fred i've never seen anything like it
it's it's your job your job is to be cute so people want to run to the gift shop and buy panda bear dolls
if we don't get more money
maggie figured that if a that if she and three of her strongest magpie friends were each to grab hold of the corner of a rocket she could they could all fly to the moon so they tried
it's a law of nature at further distances pandas have strange almost magical effect on human beings which makes us want to hug and squeeze things
if you i if you must go it would be best to fly
yes the big one in the sky that is most likely not made of cheese and most certainly not made of bamboo
no how many magpie's would we n would be needed to fly four hundred a four hundred pound panda bear and a one hundred pound bamboo rocket ship to the moon said maggie
such nonsense going to the moon said her mother poo poo
said the manager do you know that since the zoo's profits have gone up four thousand percent this is just the type of exposure he needed
hmm heavier than i thought i think we will need need more magpies said maggie yes but how many more yin yin said i'm not sure exactly reply replied maggie
fred was starting to feel uncontrollable urge to hug the panda so before he ran off to hug the palm tree
well it seems to me sir that yin yin wanted to be a great explorer and instead of became
this can almost certainly be accounted for by this strange almost magical effect that the pandas possess
she could be very persuasive a very little persuasive bird when she wanted to
who looked a lot like a panda would look if a pan if pandas were birds were discussing about going to the moon
why did the panda with a beautiful girl name yin yin have her name changed to the very un beautiful girl name columbus
but everything was not all bamboo and hugs at the zoo one morning fred was feeding yin yin and said oh yin yin i wish that more people would come to visit the zoo
as for yin yin she was b very proud to re be renamed after a famous explorer and she and maggie never stopped trying to get to the moon
there were three pandas and they were known as the pan family
their wonderful home
this is just the type of exposure we needed those pandas will be with us for a long time
so maggie flew to the owl and asked for his advice oh wise owl i have a question that i fear only you can answer she said
at least to yin yins parents fred sure was impressed though
the zoo manager laughed and walked away but did patch purchase a fashionable yellow umbrella for fred the next day
the main obstacle it turns out was getting the rocket ship off the ground
but before he fell asleep he did manage to say i believe rolling is a decidedly round about way to go
the other reason was that anyone who gets within three feet of a panda automatically falls in love with them
but yin yin the young panda was not listening to fred she was talking to her best friend maggie the magpie about going to the moon
but i just learned how to make myself into a ball and roll two and roll two days ago and i'm becoming very good at it
said t'was would be best to ask the owl then closed his eye
this bamboo bamboo was a very workable substance and pandas tend to handle bamboo a lot
wanted to be a great explorer and instead became a business woman
it turns out that the owl didn't take into consideration that once you get over one thousand magpie together they tend to fight and can't agree on a single thing
enough of this nonsense said yin yin's mother poo poo
what sort of nonsense is this for a young panda bear going to the moon indeed
fred fed the panda bears the tigers and turtles
many people know that pandas eat bamboo a lot of it
besides if you leave i'll get terribly out of shape now if you'll excuse me i need to squeeze something before i scream
well sir when columbus set out on his ship he was really trying to find a quicker way to get to get around europe in order to improve trade
after all if it weren't for yin yin they would have they would have had to move for from
it's taken me a couple of weeks to figure it out but i think yin yin wants to go to the moon and the magpies want to take her there fred said fred
it's simple economics like it or not we are spokespeople for the panda stuffed animal industry
no one could blame fred really fred wasn't a nail biter so began being eaten was definitely not something he looked forward to each afternoon at three o'clock when it was time to feed the tigers
oh well that makes sense then
one two three to the moon they said together pulling it with all their might
nonsense said the mother i'm so mad i'm going to look at that lady over there and make her want to squeeze her son's son cheeks
fred was not allowed to actually hug the panda bears since they could be dangerous so all the other people at the zoo would know that the pandas had just been fed when they saw fred hugging the rather un cuddly palm tree outside of the panda's home
the owl instantly replied two hundred two hundred thousand and seventy six give or take two
yin yin and her best friend maggie the magpie who looked a lot like a panda if
that we see on tv on the animal ch channel
plus if you weren't always cuddling with my sister so much maybe you would have been with the with her cat
you should be proud of me for thinking so fast on my toes
can i get a dog please
he her hair would grow back harder each time and soon she would have an invincible coat of cat fur armor
dad please don't read the next part
i can practice by shaving jenny's head
i mean it's be su it'll be summer soon enough and i just wanted the cat to get s get used to the idea before it really got hot
dear mom and dad
oh sure it's easy to say that i should have just picked up the cat but sometimes we don't always think all that great under pressure
the cat liked being shaved anyway so i didn't see the big deal
did you know that i wanted to be a barber
sincerely danny
and the cat was being chased by the turtle and ran right by the clippers and shaved herself
you wouldn't always take the cat's si you would al you wouldn't always take the cat's side if you knew the stuff he did to poor turtle to my poor turtle
you bought mean she's really her cat it cause she's so responsible and stu and stuff
i really didn't mean to s shave that the cat really i swear
i was afraid to tell you the real reason i shaved the cat was that because i want to be a barber and i needed practice
they are called hairless cats and and they need fur in the winter sometimes i think i swear that's the reason
that's just my opinion though
i'm getting hungry and i'm sorry for shaving the cat although you can see that it's really jenny's fault for not being the responsible as you always say and not brushing her teeth
even if she is dumb little tattle'tale
i i know how much you hate him always sneezing and so i thought if i got rid of the fur he wouldn't sneeze
not that i shaved the cat though
please shave the cat it keeps hitting on my shell and trying to roll me over when when you leave the room
i would like to start by saying that i think that you are very mean to make me do this because it wasn't even my fault
also i am going to sell the cat fur and buy my sister jenny braces for her big stupid face
they just ra ran on in the stupid wheel and did stupid things
the only reason it it hasn't come out f for two weeks is because you guys made such a big deal out of it poor kitty and that a this and poor kitty that
i couldn't buy him any anything nice since you took away m my allowance for shaving the neighbor's dog
but the real reason i shaved the cat was to make a wig for those poor hair less cats
see she's not responsible after all
last night i saw that she didn't brush her teeth oh yeah i forgot to tell you that
i saw the cat was trying to get to get the gerbils and you told us we couldn't hit animals so i didn't
ask her she said that sh that when we shave hair it grows back harder sometimes even darker
it's your fault really
you guys will just probably say it's winter danny cats don't overheat in winter
instead the the cat came into my room because jenny never plays with it li
i knew our cat would grow her fur back but some cats don't have hair
so in my conclusion
i think that she should brush her teeth twice tonight
dear mom don't let dad know the real reason i shaved the cat was because always sneezing around it
then she would be a super cat and you could take her on tv shows and get lots of money so that you can buy jenny's college
plus oscar plus oscar my turtle told me to shave the cat
i'll promise that i'll do better job then i did on the cat because now i have what dad calls life experience
fi fine oscar can't really talk but if he could he would have said
since you have grounded me and told me to write down why i am sorry before i was allowed out of my room i am mad at you
and you know what those stupid gerbils didn't even thank me
i think it really likes the its haircut
so it really was my father's day gift to him
i kept saying no kitty no don't shave yourself
but my stupid sister never taught her cat how to listen so she just ignored me
cat's aren't always nice just like my sister jenny isn't always nice
ok here's what happened as i remember it
just cause she's a good student doesn't mean she's really responsible
that you should be blaming ms casper my science teacher she made made us shave something for science
i just didn't want to see the cat getting all hot and uncomfortable and stuff
i was
enough
ps if you would have brought brought her bought her a turtle i couldn't have shaved it
i'll bet you didn't know something else
and and that you would have a better marriage
she's s she's so good at school and you brought me she
actually the truth is th that by a i i i by accident turned on the nose hair clip clip clippers
you guys never liked oscar as much as the cat anyway
i couldn't help it anyway it was an accident and i didn't even do it on purpose
plus i i forgot to tell you that
that's the last time i shave the cat to protect any stupid gerbils
how come jenny gets a cat and i get a stupid turtle anyway
if i had a cat i know that you should teach a cat to shave itself
i didn't know what else to do so i grabbed dad's nose hair c clippers and shaved it
turtles don't have do anything except poke their heads out and not be cuddly
dear mom and dad jenny didn't brush her teeth last night i think that you should
so i thought that if i could shave the cat a lot of a bunch of times
but so what if it's winter
afraid that you wouldn't let me practice on my own head
that afternoon mr blandsworth showed the class his favorite shadow pictures this is kid's stuff said the class
we should have gotten rid of mrs we shouldn't have gotten rid of mrs blandsworth they said
hot dog cried the class we get rid of blandsworth now we can do just as we please and the stroke of ten kids from two oh seven left the building no one stopped them
and they practiced some very difficult stunt work in the back yard
er said the kids they decided not to mention v miss viola swamp but they wondered why miss nelson hadn't been seen her in the hall
she's a real witch the big kid oooh said miss nelson's kids
on monday morning miss nelson's kids were all in their seats they were very nervous some of them had not slept well all weekend
we should do this more often they said they didn't notice the figure in the hall
it was mister bladworth the principal miss nelson's kids were so relieved but they soon learned that mr blandsworth was not a lot of fun
slowly the knob turned and the door opened my name is viola swamp said the lady in a scratchy voice yipes cried the kids swamp
oh look said the class miss nelson's back
while discussing erasers on the while dusting erasers on the schoolyard three of the ringleaders of two oh seven discussed the situation
heading back to school they passed miss nelson's house
not so fast the big kid said from three oh nine haven't you heard of viola swamp
the next day they weren't in class that's too bad said mrs blandsworth mister blandsworth they'll miss the excitement mr blandsworth was about to show the class his collection of ball point pens from all over the world when someone came to the door
they heard footsteps in the hall and the door opened
slowly turned the door and the door opened
and for two days mr blandsworth showed slides of his goldfish lucy miss nelson's kids had never been so bored
i'll be away next week she said and i except you to behave yes miss nelson the kids said in two oh five er two oh seven
all morning mr blandsworth tried to amuse the class with his corny cards tricks oh brother said the class
the class did as they told did as they were told the big kid from three oh nine was certainly right miss swamp was a real witch
the tall and lumpy miss nelson didn't speak er said the kids her throat must be sore are you sure you're well enough said mr blandsworth she's sure said all the kids
after school they painted and sewed and borrowed some old clothes
miss nelson telephoned mister blandsworth to see what was going on you're not miss nelson said blandsworth miss nelson is back
oooh said miss nelson's kids said
pipe down or the swamp said the swamp or just then something under her desk attracted her attention it was a mask ah ha said miss swamp so that's your little game
they went straight to the movies they saw monster ate chicago twice it's really living they said
something will have to be done and she went to her closet
if we get mrs if we get the swamp i'll just die said one kid
the next day mis mister blandsworth demonstrated his favorite bird calls they were not a success
one friday miss nelson told her class that she was going to have her tonsils out
and it would it will it said mrs swamp to the class because the swamp will be watching you
that's right said miss swamp and i'm here to whip this class into shape get back to those d desks on the double
mr blandsworth was surprised you're back sooner than we expected he said
a minute later miss nelson appeared i'm back she said
something will have to be done they said we must get rid of blandsworth they had to hatch a plot
miss swamp is the meanest substitute in the whole world said the big kid nobody acts up when she's around
miss nelsons couldn't believe her eyes those are my kids she said with a scratchy voice what are they doing out of school and who's with them
you don't say said mrs swamp miss swamp probably just some of the kids acting up i'm sure it won't happen again and mrs blan blandsworth left
afterward they went to lucy's where they stuffed themselves silly but soon they made serious mistake
back in two oh fi uhm back in two oh seven seven miss nelson's kids were spending an agreeable afternoon they were very pleased i was pleased with themselves
but at recess it was another story wow said the kids while miss nelson is away we can really act up
miss nelson is back
she knew how to get the results the class did a whole week's worth in no time
well in that case said the principal i'll be getting back to the office now nice to have you back miss nelson and he left the room
hot dog cried the kids are we glad to see you didn't you have fun with mr blandsworth asked miss nelson
and he hung up can't fool me said miss nelson hmm said miss nelson
when all turtles arrived there
this turtle's was named swish
even i was faster than you when i was your age you're cheating you're going to ruin the great race forever
the turtle cup was the trophy that the winner could take home to their village
everyone treated swish differently
the crowd thought he must have realized that it wasn't working
then he heard the mayor say runners please take your positions
mud didn't answer
so with swish they thought maybe just maybe he could bring back the turtle cup
that's not a rock sweetie said his mom that's mud
but after a few hours most of the turtles had gone a few feet all except two
she said swish you are the youngest winner of the great turtle race that was the most exciting finish we've ever had
this was swish's first ever shell dwellers festival he thought it was the most wonderful thing he ever saw
cheered for swish
sure they are nice to me now because they think i can win the race but if i lose they'll be disappointed and mad at me
rule number two all turtles must run as fast as they can and the turtle that is closest to the starting line wins
everything about the festival was fun but the main event was the great turtle race
she announced well mud it looks like you've done it sludge pond wins the turtle cup again
he was tired from racing and thought that it would be nice to just listen to mud's sweet voice and fall asleep
mostly nice turtles
he would never lose the turtle cup for the rest of his long life
swish's mom smiled and said
imagine he hadn't he hadn't had to move for over fifty years
mud from sludge pond has been disqualified for sleeping during the race
then the town promised to treat swish like a normal turtle and after a while swish decided that he would be proud to race for his village
oh no shouted the fans mud's winning it looks like mud is still the greatest turtle of them all
mrs snapper would say hi swishy do you want some yummy pie to fill you up and slow you down for the big race a fat turtle is a slow turtle
after seven days of playing and dancing and bug eating finally the day of the race came
the turtles stretched and thought really slow thoughts as they as they did the sky turned from black to dark blue
then he told swish all of mud's dirty tricks so that swish would be ready for them
after six hours mud and swish were still tied and had only moved a few inches
to break this rule would mean an end to the great turtle race forever
all the turtles in blue pond held a meeting to discuss the problem
swish was just happy too was just happy too but deep down inside he knew he was just as slow as mud
once his mother called him for dinner he didn't make it home until breakfast the next morning and he was only a foot away
you're just trying to make me quit i'm not going to fall for your tricks he said he said turtles never cheat and i'm a turtle with honor
swish took the cup that day for the first time
remember that even though he's gifted at being slow he's still very young said swish's father
mud had actually sung himself to sleep
he we all want you to look good f when you bring home the cup
there were about three hundred turtles racing
swishes father said son don't worry about it you know my grandfather raced mud once
swish and mud were both back at the starting line it looked as if neither of them had moved at all
for the first time in six hundred years i would like to present the turtle cup to blue pond the crowd went wild again
look there's your cousin peek a boo from big puddle village said swish's mother you'll get to meet all sorts of new turtles
rule number three no turtle may pretend to be going as fast as they can but go slow instead
what what would you like to say to all the turtles at the festival
live in blue pond
much greater or bigger than mud he always made sure that no one treated him special and that he treated everybody like he wanted to be treated
swish saw a big rock in the middle of the festival and wondered about it
all the turtles were very very slow
there was there were many legends about him it was rumored he was so slow his heart would only b would only beat once a day
swish had to be carried on his father's back since it would have taken him years to get to great pond by himself
swish was sad that he lost but all the turtles from blue pond
mister peeks would never do anything for free but he was giving swish a free shell waxing
the rules were nailed to the tree for all to see
just then the mayor said ready set slow and off they went
mud knew that this would be his closest raced ever and he was actually getting a little bit scared of this swish kid
the less a turtle moves the bigger they get and the longer they live
every four years turtle from all over the land would c would crawl to great pond
so one day he told his parents i don't want to race
they were very proud he gave mud such a close race
when swish was born everyone thought he was a little slow but as he got a older the turtles began to realize that swish was really really really slow
but swish wouldn't let mud scare him
mud still didn't answer in fact mud was sound asleep
the turtle cup was in a sludge was in sludge pond for over fifty years that's because no one could ever beat the turtle from there
for example mister peeks the local shell cleaner would say hey there swish do you want a free shell waxing today
but then right at the end right before the sunset
the mayor tapped mud on the shell and said hello hello mud
you have to
the slowest turtles from each pond were carried to the starting line by members of their villages
swish made a loud gulp sound
i think that you will be a great champion for many years since only turtles only get slower with age
there were thousands of turtles of many different species all having a great time
i never promised that i would win the race i can't beat mud anyway i heard once it took him three days just to yawn
this time it was a bit closer than you would have liked i'll bet
uhm except for mud of course but without him we don't have a chance
the winner of the great turtle race was so important that the winner didn't have to move for four years until the next festival
swish already
but though he became the greatest and biggest turtle of all time
i know that you can win swish but we'll be proud of you even if you don't win it's an honor just to get to race said swish's mom
then he snapped out of it and remembered his father told him about this trick gave him earplugs
this means that we have a new champion the real winner is swish softbelly at blue pond the crowd went wild
when the time of the festival drew near all the turtles all over the land started their crawl toward great pond
he was the biggest most respected and one of the trickiest turtles in history
the mayor of great pond mrs tort passed the rules of the race for everyone to see
and then when the sun went down mud was the closest turtle to the starting line
mrs snapper was never nice to anyone but he was but he was being nice to swish
they looked at the horizon and saw the sun was starting the rise
by now all the turtles were way ahead of mud but this time swish was just as slow
rule number four no turtle may fall asleep since if you are asleep you aren't running as fast as you can
the slowest turtle
the mayor of pondland went to present turtle cup to sludge pond again
the mayor doctor softshell said this is ridiculous swish has to race he's the slowest turtle i've every seen
turtles could catch up with friends they had not seen since the last festival
he would take it many more times after that it was because of swish that blue pond became the most respected pond in the land
you know what i'm going to win this race i know it and all these turtles will know that blue pond rules im not afraid of mud
blue pond was located about three days crawl from great pond
then mud tried another trick he started singing in a soft beautiful lullaby swish started yawning
ladies and gentlemen said mrs trout tort
we never thought of that they agreed
he was the slowest turtle of all time
swish started to pull ahead of mud
he wasn't as slow as you but he did teach me a thing or two
swish was suddenly very excited he told his mom
they were both moving of course but they were so slow it was hard to tell
all turtle must go as fast as they can at all times since turtles never cheat this is the most important rule
the crowd started yelling speech speech
but he doesn't want to be treated special he just wants to be normal and he doesn't want everybody to hate him if he can't beat mud
swish read the rules even though he knew them by heart
like a turtle with honor
how come they don't move that big rock out of the middle of the field it seems to be in everyone's way said swish
he put the earplugs in his ears and couldn't hear mud's singing anymore
but they all felt a little sad because they hadn't held the turtle cup in over seven hundred years
ms tort went up to swish and gave him the turtle cup
finally after the long journey all the turtles arrived at great pond
so it took some time before anyone could figure out which turtles were the slowest
his name was mud and he was the greatest champion in the history of the sh shell dwellers festival he was unbeatable
they read rule number one the great race begins at sunrise and ends at sunset
and the extra attention made swish very uncomfortable
who is this young punk he thought to himself
so you can see the winning so you can see winning the great race is a great honor
mud kept singing his lullaby for a few hours but he stopped right before sunset
when mud was in his prime there was a new turtle born in blue pond
mud said to swish there's no way that a turtle as young as you can be so slow
it would take some turtles from far away villages t two whole weeks just to get there
i know i shouldn't be telling you this but we might have to sell you and your family to the big zoo in san angeles
now no wait a second i don't understand
but the point is that he was very fond of feeding the pandas
it it was fred's idea so let's begin with fred
about those magpies flying above the pandas do you think that the zoo could purchase me a large size umbrella
it's a law of nature af at future at further distance pandas have a strange almost magical effect on human beings which makes us want to hug and squeeze things
so one day after fred fred had fed the pandas and was hugging the palm tree the zoo manager came up to him and said
the the main obstacle it turns out was getting the rocket ship off the ground
now if you excuse me i need to squeeze something before i scream scream
the owl inti instantly replied two hundred thousand and six and seventy six give it or take two
yin yin's father moo man didn't think it was a very p proper or wise for a young panda bear to go rolling off to places where there wasn't any bamboo
i'm not exactly qui i'm not sure exactly replied maggie
as for yin yin she was very proud to be renamed after a famous explorer and she and magpie never stopped trying to get to the moon
enough of the nonsense uh nonsense said yin yin's mother poo poo
one morning fred was feeding yin yin and said oh yin yin i wish that more people would come to visit the zoo
i'm so mad i'm going to look at at a lady over there and make her want to squeeze her son cheeks
he wanted to be a business man but instead became became a great explorer
i think what the zoo needs is a great advertising campaign
sleepy father
animal industry w which young lady helps pay for the bamboo that you eat
weren't so bad but as for the tigers he he wasn't so sure
if it weren't for yin yin they would have had to move from their wonderful home
if you must go it
she could be a very persuasive little bird when she wanted
oh wise owl i have a question that i fear only you can answer she said
an instant later a young boy was heard saying ouch mom cut that out
if we don't get more money it's not that you aren't s selling enough stuffed stuffed panda bears
there were they were in order of cuteness yin yin the young daughter poo poo the mother and moo man the gentle and always
it's simple economics like it or not we are spokespeople for the panda stuffed animals
the turtles were so bad but
yes the big one in the sky that is most likely not made of cheese and most certainly not made of bamboo
back in the panda's home the mother panda poo poo was very proud of her daughter after all
oh well that makes sense then said the manager
so they tried
a week later maggie managed to round up two hundred thousand and seventy eight magpie
but before he fell asleep he did manage to say i believe rolling is a decideable
said it te would be best to ask the owl then closed his eyes his eye
your job is to be cut is to be cute so people want to run to the gift shop and buy panda bear dolls
bamboo is very workable sub substance and pandas tend to handle bamboo a lot a lot so this is itself was not that astonishing at least to yin yins parents
well it seems to me sir that yin yin wanted to be a great explorer and instead became a business woman
so before he ran off to hug the palm tree quickly qui tri tree quickly said its costs so much to feed y you panda bears i would hate it if y if you had to leave us
turn your head all the way around without getting a terrible pain in your neck said the owl
a lot of bamboo can get quite heavy so because of the pandas fred became very strong and was in terrific shape
but i just learned now how to make myself into a ball and roll two days ago and i'm becoming very good at it
hmm heavier than i thought i think we will need more magpies said maggie
no one could blame fred really since no one really wants to be eaten
this is just the type of exposure we need those pandas will be with us for a long time
this can almost certainly be accounted for by the strange almost magical effect that the pandas possess
it would be best to fly
a week later despite much flapping there were sti they they were still trying and to get the rocket in the air
the panda
now while all this was going on what do you suppose fred was doing
some people do like to bite their finger nails but fred wasn't a nail biter so being eaten was definitely not something he looked forward to each afternoon at three o'clock when it was time to feed the tigers
well sir when columbus set
there were three pandas and they were known as the pan family
but yin yin the young panda was not listening to fred she was talking to her best friend maggie the magpie about going to the moon
the zoo manager laughed and walked away but did purchase a fashionable yellow umbrella for fred the next day
fred fed the panda bears the tigers and turtles
fred was not allowed to actually hug the panda bears since that could be dangerous so all the other people at the zoo would know that the pandas had just been fed when they saw fred hugging the rather un cuddly palm tree outside of the panda's home
what is going on with your pandas fred i've never seen anything like it
maggie figured that if her and three of the strongest magpie friends were to each grab hold of the corner of the rocket ship they could all fly to the moon
but he was supportive of his young daughter and showed his support by taking a nap
what sort of nonsense is this for a young papa for a young panda bear going to the moon indeed nonsense
the father watching this i this is all through one eye for he always had at least one eye asleep at all times
she was spit spiteful
yes but what does that have to do with the pandas na pandas pandas man said the zoo manager
fred was standing to starting to feel the uncomfortable urge to hug the panda
yin yin was always one to take good advice from her father and less than a week later yin yin and maggie had built a rocket ship out of bamboo
such nonsense going to the moon said her mother poo poo
many people know know that pandas eat bamboo a lot of it
but later when fred walked into the panda's home under his new
panda would look if pandas were birds
he didn't mind handling the raw meat he had to feed to the tigers his main object was to be was to being eaten
i see your wings flapping but we don't seem to be going anywhere said yin yin
that the zoo's profits have gone up four thou four thousand percent
sold at zoo gift shops then all of the other stuff animals combined
pulling with all their might
how to turn
out on his ship he was really trying to find a quick quicker way to get around europe in order to improve trade
it's just that there haven't been enough people coming to see you in the first place
yin yin said h and her best friend maggie the magpie who looked a lot like a panda would look if panda
decideally round about way to go
it is interesting to point out at this time that more stuffed panda bears are sold
do you know that since the little panda built that bamboo rocketship and those magpie's started fluttering about that
one two three to the moon they said together pulling
so maggie flew to the old owl and asked for his advice
spitefully
i see fred one morning one more thing sir
after all it's the only home you know besides if you leave i'll get terribly out of shape
fred was impressed though
i don't think it will take that long to roll there said yin yin
no how many magpies would be needed to fly a four hundred pound panda bear and one hundred pound bamboo rocket ship to the moon said maggie
yellow umbrella all she could think of was nonsense
her mother and h and father knew what they were talking about since they had thought or talked of such else since yin yin said i want to go there and p and pointed to the moon
yes but how many more yin yin said
nonsense said the mother
fred thought about it you know i think we should rename yin yin columbus
but everything was not all bamboo and hugs at the zoo
it turns out that the owl didn't take into consideration that once you get over one thousand magpie together they tend to fight and can't agree o on a single thing
the onl the other reason was that anyone who gets within three feet of a panda automatic automatically falls in love with them
why he was feeding the pandas like he was supposed to
the zoo keeper said good heavens man that is a great idea
she made us shave something for science ask her she said that when we shave hair it grows back back harder and sometimes even darker
uhm those stupid gerbils didn't even thank me they just ran on the stupid wheel and didn't and did stupid things
you wouldn't always t you wouldn't alway you wouldn't always take the cat's side if you knew the stuff to do my poor hurdle to do my poor turtle
oh yeah i forgot to tell you that
i didn't so i don't see the big deal
not that i shaved the cat though not that i shaved the cat though
so it really it's really my f it really father's day gift it's really my father's day gift to him i couldn't buy him anything nice since you took away my allowance for when i shaved the neighbor's dog
plus i forgot to tell you that i you should be blaming mrs cat caps casper my science teacher
and you could take her on tv shows and let get lots of money
p s if you would have bought her a turtle i couldn't have shaved it
i don't have to get a good i don't have to get good grades to know that you should teach a cat how to shave itself
but so what if it's winter i mean the summer is soon enough and i just wanted to the cat to get used to the idea before i got really hot
i was afraid to tell you the real reason i shaved the cat
i didn't really mean to shave the cat really i swear ok here's what happened as i remember it
i know how much you hate him always sneezing and stuff so i
i knew our cat would grow f her fur black back but some cats didn't have hair don't have hair they are called hairless cats
so conclusion i'm getting hungry and i'm sorry for shaving the cat although you can see it's really jenny's fault for not being as responsible as you always say sh and not you always say always say and not brushing her teeth
then she would be a super cat
besides the real reason i shaved the cat was to keep it nice and cool i just didn't want to see the cat getting all hot and uncomfortable and stuff
that's just my opinion though i i'll bet you didn't even
i really didn't mean to
and this and this and poor kitty that if it's your fault really dad please don't read the next part
and the cat was being ch the cat was being chased by the turtle and ran right by the cripples and it sha cl clippers and it shaved shaved itself
turtles don't do anything except their stick their poked stick their heads out of stick their heads out and not be not and be not cuddly
she's good at school and you bought her a cat because she's so responsible and stuff
fine oscar can't really talk but if h if he could he would have had said
i was afraid you wouldn't let me practice my own on my own head can i
grabbed dad's i grabbed dad's nose hair clippers and shaved it
so i thought if i got rid of its fur he wouldn't sneeze
i swear that that's the reason i also want i also was going to sell the cat
should i start all over okay since i have grounded since you have grounded me and told me to write down why i am sorry before i was allowed out of my room i am mad at you
you shouldn't be proud of me you shouldn't be proud of me for thinking so fast on my toes
so i thought that if i could shave the cat a bunch of times her hair would grow black her hair will gr grow back harder each time and soon she would h have an invincible coat of cat fur armor
that that's the least that's the last time i shave the cat to protect any stupid gerbils
i couldn't help it i couldn't help it anyway it was an accident and i didn't even do it on purpose
i think that she should brush her teeth twice tonight
cat's aren't always nice just like my sister jenny isn't always nice but the realest reason i shaved the cat was to make a wig for those poor hairless
dear mom and dad jenny didn't brush her teeth last night
i didn't it i don't i think it really i think it really liked its haircut only the reason it hasn't come out for two weeks is because you guys made such a big deal about it poor kitty
actually the truth is that but by accidentally by accident turned the nose hair clippers
how come jenny gets a cat and i get a stupid turtle anyway
sincerely danny
so that so that you can see jenny to go to college and it's it's a dumb little tattle'tale
plus oscar my turtle told me to shave the cat
plus if you weren't always cuddling with my sister so much as so much maybe you would have been with her cat instead instead the cat came into my room because jenny never plays with it
i saw that the cat was trying to get the gerbils and you told told us we couldn't hit the animals so i didn't know what else to do so i
that was why that w that was what that was that i wanted to be a barber and i needed practice
and they need fur in in the winter sometimes i think
you guys will probably just say it's winter dan just it's just winter danny cats don't overheat in winter
if i had the c if i had a if i had a cat i would teach it not to shave itself that's for sure
i bet i'll bet you didn't know something else you know that i wanted to be a barber
i shaved the cat was he always sneezing a sneezing around it
dear mom don't let dear mom don't let dad know the real reason i shaved the cat
can i get a dog please
just cause she's a good student doesn't mean that she really she's really responsible last night i saw that she didn't brush her teeth
please shave the cat it's h its keeps hitting me on the shell trying to roll me over when you leave when you leave the room
enough never plays with it enough the cat liked being shaved anyway so i didn't see the big deal
can i practice shaving jenny's head i promise that i'll do a better job then i did on the cat cause now i have dad dad now i have what dad calls life experience
sell the c sell the cat fur and buy my sister jenny braces for her big stupid face
and then you would have a better marriage
would i would like to start by saying i think you are very mean a very mean to me
you guys never liked oscar as much as the cat anyway
oh sure it's easy to say that i could have just picked the cat up but sometimes we don't always think all the great under pressure you and do you and do you know what
but later when fred walked into panda's home under his new yellow umbrella all she could think of to say was nonsense
but before he s fell asleep he did manage to say i believe rolling is a decidedly rolling about way to go if you must go it it t'would be best to fly
it's not that you aren't selling enough stuffed panda bears it's just that there aren't
a week later despite much flapping they were all trying to get the rocket into the air
hmm heavier than i thought i think we'll need more magpies said maggie but how many more said er yin yin said i'm not exactly sure replied maggie
the zoo keeper said good heavens man that's a great idea no wait a second i don't understand
it is interesting to point out that er at this time that more stuffed panda bears are sold at zoo gift shops then all of the other stuffed animals combined
okay but fred was a nail nail biter so being eaten was definitely not something he looked forward to each afternoon at three o'clock when it came time to feed the tigers
it's taken me a couple weeks to figure it out but i i think yi yin yin wants to go to the moon and the magpies want to take her there
well it seems to me sir that yin yin wants to be a great explorer instead became a business woman
but everything was not all bamboos and hugs at the zoo one morning fred was feeding yin yin er yin yin and said oh yin yin i wish that more people would come to visit the zoo
no how many magpie's would be needed to fly a four hundred pound panda bear and a one hundred pound bamboo rocket ship to the moon said er yeah said maggie
many people know that pandas eat bamboo a lot of it a lot of bamboo can get quite heavy so because of the pandas fred became very strong and was in terrific shape
the main obstacle it it turns out was getting the rocket ship off the ground
quickly said costs us so much to feed you panda bears i would hate if y you had to leave us after all it's only home you know besides if you leave i'll get terribly out of shape now if you excuse me i need to hug some hug er squeeze something before i scream
oh well that makes sense then said the manager
an instant later a young boy was heard saying ouch mom cut that out i'm sorry to say but many er but many a little boy's cheeks have been made raw when mother poo poo panda was up upset
now while all this was going on what do you supposed fred was doing why he was feeding the pandas like he was supposed to
tis would be best to ask the owl and then closed h his eye
no one could blame fred really since no one really wants to be eat eaten
your job is to be cute so people want to run to the gift shop and buy panda bear dr dolls it's simple economics
actually it was a eighty five point five degree spot on his left kidney but the point is that he was very fond of feeding the pandas
yin yin was also one to take advice from father but less than a week later yin yin and maggie had built a rocket ship out of bamboo bamboo is very workable sub substance and pandas tend to handle bamboo a lot so this in itself was not astonishing at least to the yin yin er to the yin yin's parents fred was sure was impressed though
fred was the st starting to feel uncontrollably urge to hug the panda so before he ran off to hug the palm tree qu qu
why did a panda with a beautiful girl name yin yang er yin yin have her name changed to the very un beautiful name columbus
some people do like to bite fred was no okay
back in the panda's home the mother panda poo poo was very proud of her daughter
if we don't get more money
the owl instantly replied two hundred thousand and s seventy six give or take two
it's a law of nature as at further dis distances pandas have a strange almost magical effect on human beings which makes us want to hug and squeeze things fred was not allowed to act actually hug the panda bears since that could be dan dangerous so all the other people in the zoo er
one two three to the moon they said together pulling with all their might
yes the big one in the sky that is most likely not made not made of cheese and is certainly not made of bamboo
this is just the type of exposure we need those pandas will be with us for a long time
nonsense said the mother i'm so mad i'm going to look at that lady over there and make her want to squeeze her son's cheeks she said spitefully
as for yin yin she's very proud to be renamed after a famous explorer and she and maggie never stopped trying to get to the moon
it turns out that the owl didn't take into consideration that once you get over one thousand magpies together they tend to fight and can't agree on a single thing
the father watching all this through one eye for he had a for he always had at least one eye asleep at all times said
well when columbus set out on his ship he was really trying to find a quicker way to get to get through europe in order to improve trade
w would look if pandas were birds were discussing about going to the moon her mother and her father knew that what they er what they were talking about since they hadn't thought or talked of much else since yin yin said i want to go there and pointed to the moon
enough of this nonsense said yin yin's mother poo poo what sort of nonsense is this for a young panda bear go to the moon indeed nonsense
he didn't mind handling the raw meat he had to feed the to the tigers his main objection was to being eaten
this must certainly be
for fred when it came to the pandas he had a warm spot in his heart
th that there haven't been enough people coming to see you in the first place i think what the zoo needs is a great advertising campaign
the panda
i see fred one more thing sir about these magpies flying above the pandas do you think that the zoo could purchase me a large sized umbrella
but i just learned how to make myself into a ball and roll two days ago and i've b i'm becoming very good at it i don't think it will take that long to roll there said yin yin
some people do like to bite their f er
the zoo manager laughed and walked away but did not pur purchase a fashionable yellow umbrella for fred the next day
i knew i shouldn't be telling you this but it but we must have to sell you and your family to the big zoo in s san angeles
maggie figured out that if her and h three of her strongest magpie friends were to each grab hold of a corner of the rocket ship they could all fly to the moon so they tried
but physical fitness was not the only reason fred loved the pandas the other reason was that anyone who gets within three feet of a panda panda automatically falls in love with them
do you know that since the little panda built the bamboo rocket ship and those and those magpie's started fluttering about that the zoo's profit have gone gone up four thousand percent
but yin yin the p young panda was not listening to fred she was talking to her best friend maggie the magpie about going to the moon
so one day after fred had fe feed fed the pandas and was hugging the palm tree the zoo manager came up to him and said what is going on with your pandas fred i've never seen anything like it
so maggie flew off to the owl and asked for h his advice oh wise owl i have a question that i fear only you can answer how she said
yes but what does that have to do with pandas man
like it or not we are spokespeople for the panda stuffed animal industry which young lady helps pay for the bamboo that you eat such nonsense going to the moon said her mother p poo poo but
some people do like the to bite their finger nails but since no one really wants to be eaten
how to turn your head all the way around without getting a terrible pain in your neck said the said owl
this almost certainly be accounted for by this strange almost magical effect that pandas possess
there were three pandas and they were known as the pan family they were in orders of cuteness yin yin the daughter of poo poo the mother and moo man the gentle and always sleepy father
it was fred's idea so let's begin with fred
the zoo would know that the pandas had just been fed when they saw fred hugging the rather un cuddly palm tree outside of the panda's home
yin yin's father moo man didn't think it was very proper or wise for a young panda bear to go rolling off places where there wasn't any bamboo but he was supportive of this h of his young daughter and showing his support by taking a nap
after all if it weren't for yin yin they wouldn't have they would have had to move from their wonderful home
a week later maggie managed to round up two hundred thousand and seventy eight magpie she could be very persuasive little bird when she wanted
i see your wings flapping but we don't seem to be going anywhere said yin yin
fred thought about it and said you know i think we should rename yin yin columbus
yin yin and her best friend maggie the magpie who are looking who looked a lot like a panda would look
manor
bruce okay bruce often helped people
then they snatched her purse and ran
partner in crime
and an instant later he felt himself being yanked up
in no time he had knocked them all out
he whispered to his gang then he ran out in the street and jumped into a nearby manhole
late one might dick went searching for clue for a clue he discovered a secret door that led to a flight of stairs dick followed the stairs down into the darkness
when they launched a crime spree batman would swoop away from out out of the sky on his batrope
mmm mmm mmm
they worked so quickly no one could keep up with them batman was the only was only one man to stop two face he would need help
one day he met a young circus
batman and robin said batman i like the sound of that
what's the plan tomorrow night
i told you no crime fighting aren't you glad i didn't listen dick answered i think it was it's time we became partners
then a hand grabbed him and tossed him into the batmobile it was batman and he was angry
shattered uh the tunnel walls stone and steel began to run on batman rain on batman
wealthiest man in gotham city
action actioning quickly batman pressed the button on his utility belt
he leaped and dived about kicking and punching kicking and punching
wait wait where were we
you're too young batman answered besides batman fights alone
it's just a kid we could take him easy
but an instant later a ca car came screeching to
riddler tracked down two face and made an offer two face decided to flip a coin if it comes up heads we join forces he exclaimed explained the coin hit the ground heads up okay partner we'll we have a deal two face said
up out of the pit it it was dick he followed batman later later batman said
you'll you'll be all okay now dick told the woman
uhm
the
had s s spot a woman walking down a lonely streets of gotham city
two face's weapon sent a fireball hurtling hurtling toward batman
batman was the greatest crime fighter in gotham city
the riddler explained
gotham city
while the riddler had the brains to outwit the batman he didn't have the muscles to finish him off
of n all of the gotham's richest people who will be at a big party the
in the dim light batman could see someone coming toward him it was two face carrying some kind of weapon
wayne wayne
and the ground beneath his feet collapsed batman felt himself sinking
bruce bryce
all right folks this is an old fashioned stick up
when w
and every other criminal in gotham city
riddler decided that two face would be perfect
a green glove hand reached for him
the stunned thugs thuds
dick smiled old folks used to call
but it was all a trap two face pointed to his weapon point his weapon at batman and fired
meanwhile across the town a gang of thugs
down down batman sank i'm finished he thought there's no way to escape but just before batman's head disappeared
look one of the crooks shouted that ain't batman
meanwhile the explosive fireball
he discovered an underground cave cavern filled with crime fighting equipment
or roar down the street in the batmobile just in the nick of time
dick couldn't believe his eyes he was in the inside the batcave
batman fac followed him
while batman arrives when batman arrives
when batman was fighting batman had
young circus
his gang gang members members were so busy robbing everyone they didn't notice bruce slipping out of the rooms
batman forever
another part of of town part of town criminal genius called riddler was also plotting against him
from then on batman and robin would be partners tracking down two face and riddler
why can't we fight crime together dick asked batman as they drove back to
since i just saved your life okay said batman said
committed crimes all over
it could only be mean one thing bruce
a abandoned subway tunnel
the following night two face arrived at the party right on schedule
it was no ordinary car it was the batmobile oh no one of the hounds s hoots hounds mmm screamed it's batman
he was bruce
up alongside her
instantly his costume
grayson dick was an orphan and needed a place to live bruce invited dick to stay in wayne manor
beginning its
used to say i flew like a bird on the flying trap trapeze so you could me robin
but batman but batman would soon need help another part of the town
below the sand a green glove
but dick dick quickly proved them wrong
two faces two face was the criminal batman had not caught yet two face and his gang
and there was the batmobile
the manhole led into an
to stop you he'll walk right into our trap
screeching halt came to a screeching halt in front of them
uh when he was wasn't fighting crime batman had a secret identity
easy money the hoots sneered as they crept
acrobat named dick
moments later he returned as batman two face smiled
whenever criminals tied tried to break the law batman was there to stop them
we'll clash the party and rob the guests
two face growled at the terrified guests
you've earned it but what are we going to call you
you thought you thought you were on my trail two face snarled
way wayne was batman
i expect you will be buried alive two face said a as batman sank deeper i'd love to stay and see you off see you off but criminal's a wastin' i'm very busy man then two faced walked away
wayne my
his costume was covered with a fire bolt coating the flame ball hit him him full blast but batman was protected
begin phase two
dick lived in the mansion but wondered where bruce went every evening
with the last ounce of strength batman grabbed the hand
she said that she had to help other passengers
the pilot told me there that he wasn't really that it wasn't really that hard once you practiced
but it wasn't peanuts it was something really cool
it seems like the plane was going so fast to ever stop but it seems like the planes going too fast to ever stop but it does
it was the peanuts that were making me so thirsty in the first place
i was flying there to see my grandfather and we were going to go fishing
i had a game boy in my backpack my backpack was the o was in the overhead thingy
i col the o i only used the green crayon because it was the tallest and i wanted it to catch up t to the red blue yellow and purple and black ones
i i tried to watch the movie but i had already seen
i started thinking we might crash i didn't like to think about that but i couldn't help it
there's no way i a there's no way anyone can remember to push all those buttons at the rights time we are going to crash
she didn't like called be she didn't like being called peanut lady but she did get my game boy
the person next to me would have been very annoyed
he laughed even though it wasn't joking joking
how was your flight i said someday i'm going to be a pilot and i'm only serve banana splits on my plane
or if she would get me a banana split i wouldn't have to go the bathroom so much
but to tell you the t but to tell the truth without my parents there i was pretty nervous
jennifer took me to the cockpit and there was where there was a million buttons and levers and knobs and stuff
but guess what i was too short to s uhm reach the button
i had seven colas and four ginger ales which made me had to go to the bathroom eight times
that he once played the game i had on my game boy but he couldn't even pass level one
the first time i ever took an airplane by myself it was fun and scary
my mom gave me a coloring book a of cool looking dragon to keep me busy
that one was so b i had already seen that one so it was boring
but once the plane was in the air i was pretty good
that's the way i figured it my my game my game boy only has five buttons and i can't g b get past level three
i played on my game boy until i got to new until i got a new high score then jennifer came then j jennifer came up to me and said she was she had a surprise
but it was her fault she was the one who kept trying to give me peanuts
he was really nice but he but he wouldn't play go fish with me
then he told me that he once played a game boy
she said the captain was inviting me to the cockpit
when i get off the airplane there was grandpa waiting for me he said
so that if she would get me a ba so if she wouldn't banana split i wouldn't have to go the bathroom so much
i thought awesome he also i also brought my deck of cards in case the pilot was bored and wanted to play go fish
i've always thought flying was fun you go higher th than any mountain and go faster than any car
i tried to push the button that lights up i tried to push the button that lights over up over my head so the flight attendant would come
one thing about being by yourself on an airplane is that the flight attendants are very nice to you
the w that way i figured it out
that's when that's when i missed the p my parents the most
she told me to call her jennifer instead
he said that i would make a uhm very good pilot someday if i wanted to be
eventually the flight attendant seemed to go get a little annoyed that i had to go to the bathroom so much
grandpa laughed and took me straight to the ice cream shop
she told me to be quiet and watch the movie
it was worth the whole trip just to eat a banana split with grandpa
at first i thought wow look at all those buttons then i thought
i guess it was because the plane was so loud and i didn't know anyone
so i started yelling hey peanut lady hey peanut lady
i said if you can't get even past level one then and you're a pilot then i could be a pilot too since i'm much better at pushing buttons than you are
i was glad that there wasn't anybody next to me
i didn't know anyone at all and i had to go all the way from new york to texas without my parents
i colored the dragon pictures all green so it didn't take very long
the flight attendant gave me a deck of cards but she wouldn't play go fish with me
imagine how hard it would to be work those millions of buttons and eat peanuts
i thought great more peanuts
finally we landed that was scary
i told her that i wanted a banana split instead she instead but she said we don't have banana splits on a plane
how to turn your head all the way around without getting a terrible pain in your neck said the owl
yin yin and her best friend maggie the magpie who looked a lot like a panda would look if a panda if pandas were birds
yes but what does that have to do with the pandas man said the zoo manager
i'm sorry to say but many a little boy's cheeks have been made raw when mother poo poo was upset
what is going on with your pandas fred i've never seen anything like it
i know i shouldn't be telling you this but we might have to sell you and your family to the big zoo in san angeles if we don't get more money
and three of her strongest magpie friends were to grab hold of a corner of the rocket ship they could all fly to the moon
it's not that you aren't selling enough stuffed panda bears it's just that there haven't been enough people coming to see you in the first place
they were in order of cuteness yin yin the young daughter poo poo the mother and moo man the the gentle and always sleepy father
it was fred's idea so let's begin with fred
a week later they were still trying and to get the rocket into the air
the zoo manager laughed and walked away but did purchase a fashionable yellow umbrella for fred the next day
this is just the type of exposure we need those pandas will be with us for a long time
yes but how many more yin yin said i'm not sure exactly replied maggie
the father watching this all through one eye for he always had at least one eye asleep at all times
after all it's the only home you know besides if you would leave i'll get terribly out of shape
the other reason was that anyone who gets within three feet of a panda automatically falls in love with them
it would be best to fly
some people do like to bite their finger nails but fred wasn't a nail biter so being eaten was definitely not something he looked forward to each afternoon at three o'clock when it was time to feed the tigers
it's simple economics like it or not we are spokespeople for the panda stuffed animal industry which young lady helps pay for the bamboo that you eat
this can almost certainly be accounted for by the strange almost magical effect that the pandas possess
at least to yin yins parents fred was sure impressed though
the owl instantly replied two hundred thousand and seventy six give or take two
i see fred
yin yin was always one to take good advice from her father
oh well that makes sense then said the manager
but he was supportive of his young daughter and showed his support by taking a nap
i see your wings flapping but we don't seem to be going anywhere said yin yin
fred was starting to feel the uncontrollable urge to hug the panda
a lot of bamboo can get quite heavy so because of the pandas fred became very strong and was in terrific shape
but before he fell to sleep he did manage to say i believe rolling is a decidedly round about way to go if you must go
he didn't mind handling the raw meat he had to feed to the tigers his main objection was being eaten
enough of this nonsense said yin yin's mother poo poo what sort of nonsense is this for a young panda bear go to the moon indeed
but the point is he was very fond of feeding the pandas
the panda
as for yin yin she was very proud to be renamed after a famous explorer and she and maggie never stopped trying to get to the moon
after all if it weren't for yin yin they would have to move from their wonderful home
the zoo keeper said good heavens man that is a great idea no wait a second i don't understand
so maggie flew to the owl and asked for his advice
but yin yin the young panda was not listening to fred she was talking to her best friend maggie the magpie about going to the moon
well sir when columbus set out on his ship he was really trying to find a quicker way to get to get around europe in order to improve improve trade
fred was not allowed to actually hug the panda bears since that could be dangerous
nonsense said her mother i'm so mad i'm going to look at that lady over there and make her want to squeeze her sons cheeks she said spitefully
why he was feeding the pandas like he was supposed to
actually it was an eighty five point five degree spot in his left kidney
but i just learned how to make myself into a ball and roll two days ago and i've becoming very good at it
but everything was not all bamboo and hugs at the zoo
maggie figured that if she and
were discussing about going to the moon
no how many magpies would be needed to fly a four hundred pound panda bear and a one hundred pound bamboo rocket ship to the moon
well it seems to me sir that yin yin wanted to be a great explorer and instead became a business woman
pa yin yin's father moo man didn't think it was very proper or wise for a young panda bear to go rolling off to places where there wasn't any bamboo
it's taken me a couple of weeks to figure out what i think yin yin wants to go to the moon and what and the magpies want to take her there
so they tried one two three to the moon they said together pulling it with all their might
i think what the zoo needs is great advertising campaign
many people knew that pandas eat bamboo a lot of it
her mother and father knew what they were talking about since they hadn't thought or talked of much else since yin yin said i want to go there and pointed to the moon
fred fed the panda bears the tigers and turtles the turtles weren't so bad but as for the tigers tigers he wasn't so sure
that more suffered panda bears are sold at zoo gift shops
it turns out that the owl didn't take into consideration that once you never once you got over one thousand magpie together they tend to flight and can't agree on a single thing
back in the panda's home the mother panda poo poo was very proud of her daughter
fred thought about it and said you know what i think we should n rename yin yin columbus
now if you excuse me i need to squeeze something before i scream
said it t'would be best to ask the owl then closed his eye
it's a law of nature at further distances pandas have a strange almost magical effect on human beings which makes us want to hug and squeeze things
such nonsense going to the moon said her mother poo poo
for fred when it came to the pandas he had a warm spot in his heart
now while all this was going on what do you supposed fred was doing
the main obstacle it turns out was getting the rocket ship off the ground
a week later maggie managed to round up two hundred thousand seventy eight magpie she could be a very persuasive little bird when she wanted
a less than week later yin yin and maggie had built a rocket ship out of bamboo
one more thing sir about those magpies flying above the pandas do you think that the zoo could purchase me a large sized umbrella
did you know that since the little panda built the bamboo rocket ship and those magpie's started fluttering about that the zoo's profits have gone up four thousand percent
hmm heavier than i thought i think we will need more magpies said maggie
so before he ran off to hug the palm tree quickly said it costs so much to feed you panda bears i would hate if you had to leave us
but physical fitness was not the only reason that fred loved the pandas
nonsense your job is to be cute so people will to run to the gift shop and buy panda bear dolls
no one could b blame fred really since no one really wants to be eaten
bamboo is very workable substance and pandas tend to handle bamboo a lot so this in itself was not that astonishing
then all of the other stuff combined
there were three pandas and they were known as the pan family
why did a panda with the beautiful girl name yin yin have her name changed to the very un beautiful girl name columbus
it is i it is interesting to point out this at a time
but later when fred was walked into the panda's home under his new yellow umbrella all could she all thi she could think to say was nonsense
yes the big one in the sky that is most likely not made of cheese and most certainly not made of bamboo
oh wise owl i have a question that i fear only you can answer she said
an instant later a young boy was heard saying ouch mom cut that out
he wanted to be a business man instead of and but instead became a great explorer
so all the other people at the zoo would know that the pandas had just been fed when they saw fred hugging the rather un cuddly palm tree outside of the panda's panda's home
i don't think it will take that long to roll there said yin yin
so one day after fred had fed the pandas and was hugging the palm tree the zoo manager came up to him and said
one morning when fred was feeding yin yin and said oh yin yin i wish that more people would come and visit the zoo
he was really nice but he wouldn't play go fish with me
i told her that it was the peanuts that were making me so thirsty in the first place and that if she could get me a banana split it would i wouldn't have to go the bathroom so much
finally we landed that that's always scary it seems like the plane is going too fast to even stop but it does
jennifer took me into the cockpit and there were a million buttons and levers and knobs and stuff
i've always thought flying was fun you go higher than any mountain and you go faster than any car but to tell you the truth with without my parents there i was pretty nervous
i had a game boy in my backpack my backpack was in the in the overhead thingy
one thing about being being by yourself on an airplane is that the flight attendants are very nice to you
the flight attendant gave me a deck of cards but she wouldn't play go fish with me she said she had to help other passengers
grandpa laugh laughed and took me straight to the ice cream shop i was worth the whole trip just to eat a banana split with grandpa
my mom gave me a coloring book of cool looking dragons to keep me busy i colored the dragon pictures all green so it didn't take very long
eventually the flight attendant seemed to get a little annoyed that i had to go to the bathroom so much but it was her fault
the first time i ever took an airplane by myself it was a fun and scary
she didn't like being called peanut lady but she did get my game boy she told me to call her jennifer instead
i s i said if you can't even get past level one then you're a pilot and you're a pilot then i could be a pilot t too since i'm much better at pushing buttons than you are

she said the captain was inviting inviting me to see the cockpit cockpit i thought i thought awesome i also bought brought my deck of cards in the case in case of the pilot was bored and wanted wanted to play go fish

i played my game boy until i got my new high score then jen then jennifer came up to me and said she had a surprise i thought great more peanuts but it wasn't peanuts peanuts it was something really cool
he laughed even though i wasn't joking he s said he thought i would make a great pilot someday if i wanted to be
ever and he would actually getting a little bit scared of this swish kid
but mud kept singing his lullaby for a few hours but he stopped right before sunset
they sure sure they are nice to me now because i think i can win the race
started their crawl toward
you're just trying to make me quit i'm not going to fall for your tricks
the mayor of pondland went to present turtle cup to sludge pond again
swish swish has to race he's the slowest turtle i've every seen except for mud of course
had gone a few feet except for two
everything about the festival was fun but the main event was the great turtle race
that swish was really really really slow
the mayor tapped on
there were thousands of turtles many different species all having a great time
ms snapper was never nice to anyone but she was being nice to swish
he would never lose
the by them
that the winner would take home to their village
so with swish they thought maybe just maybe he could bring the back the turtle cup
went up to swish and gave him the turtle cup she said swish you are the youngest winner of the great race great turtle race
okay
how come they don't move that big rock out of the middle of the field it seems to everyone's way
but if i lose they'll be disappointed and mad at me
it would take some turtles far away from the villages two whole weeks just to get there
this time it was a bit closer than you would have liked it i bet i'll bet
swishes father said son don't worry about it
he was the slowest turtle of all time imagine he hadn't
the real winner is swish softbelly of blue pond the crowd went wild
swish's mom smiled
after six hours mud and swish were still tied and had only moved a few inches
the rules were nailed to a tree for all to see
this means that we have a new champion
but then he snapped out of it and remembered his father telling him about this trick and he
it was a it was rumored
there
but she was
he always made sure that no one treated him special that he liked to be treated by everybody and he wanted to be treated like a turtle with honor
all over the land started to crawl there
all turtles must go as fast as they can at all times
we all want you to look good
the crowd went wild again
and the sun went down mud was the closest uhm turtle to the starting line
swish made a loud gulp sound
this turtle was named swish
said ready set slow and off they went
i can't beat mud anyway i heard once it took him three days just to yawn
the slowest turtle
but until the next festival
but then right at the end right before the sunset swish started to pull ahead of mud
great pond
then mud tried another trick he started singing a soft beautiful lullaby
it looked as if neither of them had moved at all
but he doesn't want to be treated special he just wants to be normal and he doesn't want everybody to hate him if he can't beat mud
uhm hello hello mud mud still didn't answer in fact mud was sound asleep mud had actually sung himself to sleep
swish s was suddenly very excited
there were many l legends about him
swish started yawning
the slowest turtle from each pond were carried to the starting line by members of their village
mister peeks would never do anything for free
the turtle cup for the rest of his long life
that's because no one could ever beat the turtle
when the time of the festival drew near all the turtles
all the turtles must run as fast as they can and the turtle that is the closest to the starting line wins
i think you'll be a great champion for many years since turtles have only gotten slower with the age
that's not a rock sweetie said mom that's mud
just then the mayor
there were lots of eating and laughing
the turtles but he got a little older the turtles began to realize
the crowd started yelling speech speech
then he told swish about all the muddy all of mud's dirty tricks so that swish would be ready for them
had to move for fifty years
this was swish's first ever shell shell uh shell dwellers festival
that day for the first time he would take it many more times after that
swish read the rules even though he knew them in his heart
the turtle cup was a trophy
mostly nice turtles lived in blue pond
ms tort
ruling
i know that you can win swish but we'll be proud of you even if you don't win it's just an honor to get to the race said swish's mom
mud knew that this would be the closest race he had ever
we'll we never thought that they agreed thought of that they agreed
blue pond was a located about three days crawl from the great pond
and gave him earplugs
were about three hundred turtles racing
he was giving swish a free shell waxing
you're cheating you're going to ruin the great race forever
crawl
rule number four no turtle may fall asleep since if you are asleep you aren't running as fast as you can
when you bring home the cup
they were very proud he gave mud such a close race swish was happy too
so it took some time before anyone could figure out which of the turtles were the slowest
all the turtles in blue pond held a meeting to discuss this problem
to race for his village
who is this young punk he thought to himself
the crowd thought he must have realized that it wasn't working
he said turtles never cheat i'm a turtle with honor
but without him we don't have a chance
he announced
mayor of the great pond
once his mother called him for dinner and he didn't
swish and mud were both in the back at the starting line
every winner of the great turtle race was so important that he or she didn't have to move for years
then he heard the mayor say runners please take your positions
and no one of the trickiest turtles in history
look there's your cousin peek a boo from big puddle village said swish's mother you'll get to meet all sorts of new turtles
that was the most exciting finish we've ever had
everyone treated swish differently for example mister peeks the local shell cleaner would say hey
mud said to swish there's no way that
as the sky did turned from black to dark blue they looked at the horizon the sun was starting the rise
i never promised
was in his prime
but what you like to say to all the turtles at the festival
you know my grandfathers raced mud once he was as slow as you but he did teach me a thing or two
when all the turtles arrived there was a seven day festival called the shell dwellers festival
finally after the long journey all the turtles have arrived at great pond
rule number two all turtles must run as fast as they can and the turtle that is closest to starting the line wins
the less a turtle moves the bigger they got and the longer they live so you can see winning the great race is a great honor
he was so slow his heart would only beat once a day his name was mud
they read rule number one the great race begins at sunrise and ends at sunset
and he was only one foot away
by now all the turtles were way ahead of mud but this time swish was just as slow
and s said swish's swish's father
since turtles n never cheat this is the most important rule to break this rule would mean an end to the great turtle race forever
swish took the cup
i was faster than you were young i was your age
the turtles were very very slow
so one day he told his parents i don't want to race
swish s was sad that he lost the lost but all the turtles from the blue pond cheered for swish
when swish was born everyone thought he was a little slow but he got but
well mud it looks like you've done it again sludge pond wins the turtle cup again
every four years turtles from all over the land would crawl to great pond
from there
years to get to great pond by himself
the lesson
all these turtles will know that blue pond rules i'm not afraid of mud
oh no the sh the sh shouted the fans
swish had to be carried on his father's back since it would have taken him
well
ms tort posted the rules of the race for everyone to see
ladies and gentlemen men ms ms tort mud from sludge pond has been disqualified for sleeping during the race
make it home until breakfast the next day morning
they were both moving of course but they were so slow it was hard to tell
you have to remember that even though he's gifted he's still very young
but though he became the greatest the biggest turtle of all time much greater or bigger than mud
he told his mom you know what i'm going to win this race i know it
but he was so tired from racing he thought that it be nice to just listen to mud's sweet voice and fall
rule number three no turtle may pretend to go be going as fast as they can but go slow instead
for the first time in seven hundred years i would like to present the turtle cup to blue pond
there swish do you want a free shell waxing today
a turtle as young as you can be so slow even when
that i would win the race
there was a new turtle born in blue pond
mud's winning it looks that like mud is still the greatest turtle of all of them
mud didn't answer
after seven days of playing and dancing and bug eating finally the day of the race came
turtles could catch up with friends they had not seen since last since the last festival
it was because of swish that blue pond became the most respected pond in the land
ms snapper would say hi swishy do you want some yummy pie to fill you up and slow you down for the big race a fat turtle is a slow turtle
he was the biggest most respected
he thought it was the most wonderful thing he ever saw
but they all felt a little sad because they hadn't held the turtle cup in over seven hundred years
the turtles stretched the really slow thoughts
when mud
swish saw a rock in the middle of the big festival and wondered about it
then the town promised to sweet to treat swish like a normal turtle after a while they decided that he would be proud for
there were all the slowest of slow
extra attention made swish very uncomfortable
but he he put the earplugs in his ears and couldn't hear mud's singing anymore
but swish wouldn't let mud scare him
after a few hours most of the turtles
the mayor o doctor softshell said this is ridiculous
but down deep inside he knew he was just as slow as mud
a day is a long time and habits are powerful especially bad habits even with the promise of a dime sister couldn't re couldn't remember not to nibble mama and papa got discouraged too
now sister was in first grade regular school was different it was still fun and she liked sh and she liked teacher jane very much but it wasn't all fun
i'm joking i'm joking interrupted brother and he and he was sort of
habits are very important part of our lives and most of them are good brushing your teeth and combing your fur when you get up in the morning
decided it needed nibbled the plan worked not perfectly it's hard to break a habit and sister had to give some back of those pennies but in ten days she had ninety three pennies
you just ke you just need a little help that's all said mama let's plant gran's tulips while i think about it and later i'll talk to your papa he may have some ideas
sister bear who lived with her mama papa and brother in the big tree house down a sunny dirt road deep in bear country had been going to school for quite a while
norman sucked his thumb suck suck suck and sister nibbled her nails ni nibble nibble nibble nibble
what and interesting idea said mama as she listened to wise old grizzly gran
why it's so deep now that i can't get out of it without a little help
and the next time she played jacks she got all the way up to tensies
the berenstain bears and the bad habit
that's what happened of some of the cubs in teacher jane's class
oh you're very welcome my dear said gran when mama called and how is everything at your house is that so you know i was a nail biter when i was a cub and my mama helped me stop helped me to stop
in regular school you have to concentrate and sometimes when you concentrate you form little nervous habits
you would like to have your nice nails grow back wouldn't you was mama's answer oh yes said sister but i keep forgetting why is it so hard to remember
but even better she had ten fine fingernails
or tune the tv or scratch when you have an itch and when sister tried to play jacks she couldn't get any higher than twosies
dear me no said mama nail biting is a kind of nervous habit and shouting and threatening will just make her more nervous
next had come kindergarten that was fun too they were marching games and rhythm band
it didn't take sister long to decide to pull off tho bi those bits of tape
just waiting to re to be remembered when some nail decided to
oh dear said mama bear to sister when the cubs got home from school one day you've nibbled your nails down to nubbins in fact you've nibbled them clean off how did that happen i'm not exactly sure mama sister said
here's what i want here is where i want to plant the bulbs
and those and with those pennies in her pocket jingling when she got on the school bus jingling when she jumped rope in the schoolyard
that's when brother bear looked at his fingernails and piped you know i think i might start biting my nails i could use the money
there was quite a lot of work spelling number problems all kinds of things
oh well sighed mama life goes on i must call gran and thank her for the tulip bulbs
and looking both ways before you cross a road but some habits aren't so good like biting nails asked sister
the bits of tape helped sister remember not to nibble but they also got in the way when she tried to do certain things it's very hard to hold a pencil with tape all over your fingers
i could read the riot act to her suggested papa you know nail biting is an outrageous disgraceful habit and if you don't stop it immediately
first there had been nursery school which was pure fun playing with dolls and blocks rolling clay snakes and scribbling with crayons
that's right said papa until the habit's broken i'll never nibble again she said as she thought of all those dimes she was going to get
the next morning when sister lined up for school lizzy bruin and some others began pointing and teasing sister nibbles her nails sister nibbles her nails
before she knew it she had nibbled them down to nubbins in fact she nibbled them down so far that some of her fingers were getting sore
that's the way it is with a bad habit the more you get the more you use it the harder it is to get out of it
so they tried gran's idea instead of a dime at the end of each day they gave sister ten pennies one for each nail at the beginning of each day ten pennies to keep unless she nibbled
phew said papa bear i'm glad that's over yes indeed agreed mama breathing with a great sigh of relief
before mama could answer sister bear who had been nervously biting in the next room popped in and said a dime ten whole cents every day just not for biting my nails
but worst of all the bits of tape told the whole world that sister bear was a nail biter
lizzy twirled her fur twirl twirl twirl freddy scratched his head freddy scratched his head scratch scratch scratch
what have you tried so far uhm uh huh well i think you're on the right track with the dime but instead of a dime and instead of giving it to her at the end of the day
well mama said it's sort of like this path it's wheeled this barrow over it so many times that it's worn a deep rut tight down the middle and its and it keeps getting deeper every time i use it
great for picking up things tuning the tv and scratching itches
i suppose so said papa thoughtfully perhaps some sort of reward would help a bit of money let's say a dime for every day she doesn't bite her nails
she also learned a lot of numbers in kindergarten and most of the alphabet
but the way it turned out she didn't get a single dime all she got was discouraged
a habit mama said as she pushed the wheelbarrow along the well worn path is something you do so often you don't even have to think about it
but some of them are getting sore hmm said mama well here's what we will do we will put a little medicine on the sore ones and bits of adhesive tape on all of them that will remind you not to nibble and will give them a chance to grow back
what about my nail biting habit asked sister as she helped mama out of the deep rut how am i going to get rid of it
i certainly hope you're joking roared papa because if you're not
dad please don't read the next part
so in conclusion i'm getting hungry and i'm sorry for shaving the cat
if i had a cat i would teach it to not shave itself that's for sure
please shave the cat it keeps hitting me on the shell and trying to roll me over when you leave the room
i saw that the cat was trying to get i get the gerbils and told and told and you told us we couldn't hit him
last night i saw her i saw that she didn't brush her teeth oh yeah i forgot to tell you that
dear mom don't let dad know the real reason i shaved the cat was that he al he's always sneezing around it
plus i forgot to tell you that she that you should blame ms casper my s my teacher
and did stupid things
i have what dad calls life experience
but so what if win if it's winter i mean i'll be it'll be summer soon enough
i would like to start by saying that i think you are a very mean to make me do this because wasn't even my fault
i knew our cat would grow her fur back
the cat liked being shaved anyway so i don't think see the big deal
but the realest reason i shaved the cat was to make a wig for those poor hair less cats that we saw on tv on the animal channel
sincerely danny
did you know that i wanted to be a barber
i couldn't buy him anything nice since you took away my allowance for when i shaved the neighbor's dog
and soon she would have an inv invincible coat of cat fur armor
dear mom and dad
you could be proud of me for thinking so fast on my toes
plus if you weren't always cuddling with my sister so much maybe she would have been with her cat
you wouldn't always take the cat's side you would always take the cat's side if you knew the stuff he did to my poor turtle
so i grabbed dad's nose hair clippers and shaved it
i think that she should brush her teeth twice tonight that's just my opinion though
so i thought if i got rid of his fur he wouldn't sneeze and that you would have a better marriage
she said that when we shave hair it grows back under harder and sometimes even darker
besides the real reason i shaved the cat was to keep it nice and cool
plus oscar my turtle told me to shave the cat
i really didn't mean to shave the cat really i swear
she's so good at school and you bought her a cat cause she's so responsible and stuff
they're are called hairless cats and they need fur in the winter some sometimes i think i i swear that's the reason
and and you know what those stupid gerbils didn't even thank me they just ran on that stupid wheel and didn't
i promise that i'll do a better job then i did on the cat cause now cause now i haven't i have that
the only reason it hasn't come out for two weeks is because you guys made such a big deal about it
i was afraid you wouldn't let me practice on my own head can i practice by shaving jenny's head
turtles don't do anything except poke their heads out and out and be not cuddly
and ran right by the clippers and shaved herself
although you can see that it's really jenny's fault for not being as responsible as you always say and not brushing her teeth
you guys never liked oscar as much as the cat anyway
i don't have any i don't have to get good grades to know what you should teach a cat that you should teach a cat to shave itself
dear mom and dad jenny didn't brush her teeth last night
ps if you would
so you so you i didn't know what else i could do
she made us shave something for science ask her
i know how much you hate him always sneezing and stuff
not that i shaved the cat though
that is the last time i that is the last time i shave the cat to the p to the project any stupid gerbils
and i just wanted to i just wanted the cat to get used to the idea before it got really hot
and soon she would have wait and you could take her on tv shows and get lots of money so that you can can send jenny to college even if she is a dumb little tattle tale
i couldn't help it anyway it was an accident and i didn't even do it on purpose
but sometimes c but some cats don't have hair
that great under p pressure
i think i really like its haircut
i was afraid to tell you the real reason i shaved the cat that was i want to be a barber and i needed practice
then she saw then she would be a super cat
how come jenny gets a cat i get a stupid turtle anyway
uhm actually the truth is that i by accident turned on the nose hair clippers and the cat was being chased by the turtle
you guys will just probably say it's winter danny cats don't overheat in winter
since you have grounded me and told me to write down why i am sorry before i was allowed out of my room i am mad at you
oh sure it's easy to say that i should have just picked up the cat up put picked the cat up but sometimes we don't always think that great
cat's aren't always nice just like my little s sister jenny isn't always nice
instead the cat came into my room because jenny never plays with it uhm enough
i bet you didn't know something else
if you would have brought bought her a turtle i couldn't have shaved it
so i thought that if i could shave the cat a lot a lot of bunch of times her hair would grow back harder each time
so it was really my father's day gift to him
actually the truth is
i just didn't want to see the cat getting all the all the hot and uncomfortable stuff
fine oscar can't really talk but if he could he would have said
she just ignored me see i see she's not so responsible after all
just cause she's a good student doesn't mean she's really responsible
ok here's what happened as i remember it
i also was going to sell the cat's fur to buy my sister jenny braces for her big stupid face
poor kitty this poor kitty that it's it's your fault really
can i get a dog please
i kept saying no kitty don't shave yourself but my stupid sister never taught her cat how to listen
she could be very she could be a very persuasive little bird when she wanted to be
do you know that since the little panda built the bamboo rocket ship that these and those magpie's started fluttering about the zoo p that the zoo profits have g gone up four thousand percent
oh wise owl i have a question that i fear only you can answer he said
yes the big one in the sky that is most likely not made of cheese and most certainly not made of bamboo
the other reason was that anyone who gets to within three feet of a panda automatically falls in love with them it's the law of nature
an instant later the young boy was heard saying ouch mom cut that out
no one could blame fred really since no one really wants to be eaten
one morning fred was feeding yin yin and said oh yin yin i wish more people would come to visit the zoo
one two three to the moon s they said together pulling with all their might
so before he ran off to hug the palm tree he quickly said
they were in order of cuteness yin yin the young daughter poo poo the mother and moo man the the gentle and always sleepy father
this almost certainly became accounted for
as for yin yin she was proud to be very renamed after the famous explorer and she and magpie never stopped trying to get to the moon
and a one hundred pound ba bamboo rocket ship to the moon said maggie
her mother and father uhm knew what they were talking about since they had thought they hadn't thought or talked of much else since yin yin said i want to go there and pointed to the moon
he wanted to be a business man but instead he became a great explorer
was always one to take good advice from her father and less than a week later yin yin and maggie had to build a rocket ship out of bamboo
so one day after fred had fed the pandas he was hugging the palm tree the zoo manager came up to him
but he was supportive of of his young daughter and showed his support by taking a nap
fred was starting to feel the uncontrollable urge to hug the panda
i'm not sure exactly replied maggie
actually it was an eighty five point five degree spot on his left kidney but the point is that he was very fond of feeding the pandas
after all if it weren't for yin yin they had to move from their wonderful home
the zoo manager laughed and walked away but di but did purchase a fashionable yellow umbrella for fred the next day
fred thought about it and said you know i think we should rename yin yin columbus
no how many people how many magpie's would it would be needed to fly a four hundred panda bear to the
fred was not allowed to actually hug the panda bears since that could be dangerous
the zoo keeper said good heavens man that is a great idea now wait a second i don't understand
yin yin always
for fred when it came to pandas he had a warm spot in his heart
now while all this was going on what do you suppose fred was doing
i don't think it would take that long to roll there said yin yin
it's not that you aren't selling enough stuffed panda bears it's just that we haven't it's just that there haven't been enough people coming to see you in the first place
hmm heavier than i thought i think we'll need some more magpies said maggie
now if you'll excuse me i need to squeeze something before i scream
a lot of bamboo can get quite heavy so because of the pandas fred became very strong and was in terrific shape
fred fed the panda bears and tigers and turtles the turtles weren't so bad but as for the tigers he wasn't so sure
like it or not we are spokespeople for the panda stuffed animal industry which young lady helps pay for the bamboo you eat
by this strange most magical effect on that the pandas possesses
a week later maggie managed to round up two hundred thousand and seventy eight magpies
well it seems to me sir said yin yin that yin yin wanted to be a great explorer and instead became a business woman
at least to the yin yins parents fred sure was impressed though
it's taken me a couple of weeks to figure it out but i think yin yin wants to go to the moon and the magpies want to take her there said fred
nonsense said the mother i'm so mad
a week later despite much flapping they were still trying to get the rocket into the air
one more thing sir those magpies flying about the pandas do you think the zoo could purchase me a large size umbrella
this is just the type of exposure we needed these those pandas will be with us for a long time
yin yin and her best friend maggie the magpie who looked a lot like a panda if
how to turn your head all the way around without getting a terrible pain in your neck said the owl
i'm sorry to say but many a little boy's cheeks have been raw from when mother poo poo panda was upset
at further distances pandas have strange almost magical effect on human beings which makes them want to hug hug and squeeze things
but i just learned how to make myself into a ball and roll two days ago and i've become and i'm becoming coming very good at it
it turns out that the owl did not take in consideration that once you are over a thousand magpie together they tend to fight and don't agree on a single thing
some people like to bite their finger nails but fred wasn't a nail biter so being eaten was definitely not something that he looked forward to each afternoon at three o'clock when it was time to feed the tigers
i see your wings flapping but we don't seem to be going anywhere said yin yin
i know i shouldn't be telling you this but we might have to sell you and your family to the big zoo in los angeles if we don't get more money
it costs so much to feed you panda bears i would hate if you had to leave us after all it's the only home you know besides if you leave i'll get terribly out of shape
many know many people know that pandas eat bamboo a lot of it
your job is to be cute so people will to run to the gift shop and buy panda bear dolls it's simply economics
it was fred's idea so let's begin with fred
enough of this nonsense said yin yin's mother poo poo what sort of nonsense is this for a young panda bear going to the moon indeed nonsense
the owl instantly replied two hundred s thousand seventy six give or take two
bamboo is very work workable substance and pandas tend to handle bamboo a lot so this itself was not very astonishing
yes but does that have what does that have to do with the pandas man the zoo ke said the zoo manager
before he fell asleep he didn't he did manage to say i believe rolling is decidedly round about way to go if you must go it would be best to fly
what is going on with your pandas fred i've never seen anything like it
the father watching all this through one eye for he always had at least one eye asleep at all times said
there were three pandas and they were known as the pan family
the panda
it is interesting to point out the time that they were s that more were stuffed that more stuffed pandas were sold at the zoo gift shops then all the other stuff combined
but later f when fred walked into the panda's home under his new yellow umbrella all that she could think o to say was nonsense
back in the panda's home the mother panda poo poo was very proud of her daughter
like a panda would if pandas were birds were discussing about going to the moon
so all the other people at the zoo would know that the pandas had just been fed when they saw fred hugging the rather rather un cuddly palm tree outside the panda's home
well sir columbus set out on a ship he was really to trying trying to find a quicker way to get to get around the w europe in order to improve improve trade
yin yin's father moo man didn't think it was very proper or wise for a young panda bear to go rolling off to places where there wasn't any bamboo
why he was the feeding the pandas like he was supposed to
yes but how do we get more yin yin said
i think what the zoo needs is a great advertising ca campaign
but yin yin was the youngest panda was not listening to fred she was talking to her best friend maggie the magpie about going to the moon
i'm going to look at that lady over there and make her want to squeeze her son cheeks she said spitefully
but physical fitness was not the only reason that fred loved the pandas
such nonsense going to the moon said her mother poo poo
he didn't mind handling the raw meat he had to feed the to the tigers his main object objection uh objection was being eaten
maggie figured that if she and the and three of her strongest magpie friends were able to each grab hold of a corner of the rocket ship they could all fly to the moon so they tried
but everything was not all bamboo and hugs at the zoo
the main obstacle it turns out was getting the rocket ship off the ground
i see fred
oh well that makes sense then said the manager
t'would be the best to ask the old owl then closed his eye
i said if you can't even get past level one and you're a pilot then could then i could be a pilot too since i'm much better at pushing buttons than you are
so i started yelling hey peanut lady peanut lady she didn't like me calling her peanut lady but she did get m me my game boy
i started thinking that we might crash i didn't like to think about that but i couldn't help it
but it was her fault she was the one that kept trying to give me peanuts
i didn't know anyone all the all that had to go the way from new york to texas without my parents i was flying there to see my grandfather and we were going to go fishing
finally we landed landed
she had to help other passengers
the pilot told me that there wasn't
the airplane ride
finally we landed
i had seven cola's and four ginger ale's which made me had to go to the bathroom eight times
grandpa laughed and took us straight and took me straight to ice cream shop
she told me to be quiet and watch the movie i tried to watch the movie but i had already seen it seen that so it was boring the flight attendant gave me a deck of cards but she wouldn't play go fish with me she said
it was pretty good my mom gave me a coloring book of cool looking dragons to keep me busy i colored the dragon pictures all green so it didn't take very long
i told her that i wanted a banana split instead but she said there they have they don't have any banana splits on this plane
although i i thought awesome i also brought a d deck of cards in case the pilot was bored and wanted to play go fish
that's always scary it seems like the plane is going too fast to ever stop but it does
that it wasn't really that hard once you
one thing about being by yourself on airplanes is that the flight attendants are very nice to you
he laughed even though i'm was wasn't joking he said he thought i would make a really great pilot someday if i wanted to be he was really nice but he wouldn't play go fish with me
she told me to call her jennifer instead
in the first place and that if she would give me a banana split i wouldn't have to go the bathroom so much
there was grandpa waiting for me he said how was your flight i said someday i'm going to be a pilot and i'm only going to serve banana splits on my plane
that's when i missed my parents the most but once a plane was in the air i felt pretty good
one night the paper clip fell off
i had my gameboy in my back i had a game boy in my backpack my backpack was o in the overhead thingy i tried to push the bottom lights over so the flight attendant would come would
but it wasn't the peanuts she was s she said something really cool she said that the captain was inviting me to see the cockpit
i've always thought flying was fun you go h you you go higher than any mountain go faster than any car
had a surprise i thought th i great i thought more peanuts
i only used the green crayon because it was the tallest and i wanted to catch up with the red brown blue yellow purple and black ones
eventually the flight attendant seemed to get a little annoyed that i had to go to the bathroom so much
the first time i ever took an airplane by myself was fun and scary
i i was glad that there wasn't anyone next to me the person next to me would have would have been been very annoyed
i played on my game boy until i got the new high score then jennifer came up to me and said
it was worth the whole trip just to eat b a banana split with grandpa
the way i figured out my game my game boy was only five buttons and i can't get past the th the past the l i can't get past level three imagine how hard it'd be to work all those millions of buttons and eat peanuts
it's right here
practiced then then he told me that the once the once that once he played game ga the game i had on my game boy and he couldn't even pass level one
lights over so my flight attendant would come but guess what she was she was too short to reach the bottom
when i got off the airplane there was my
jennifer took me to the cockpit and there was one million buttons
but to tell the truth without my parents there i was pretty nervous i guess it was because the plane was so loud and i didn't know anyone
grandpa laughed and then took me straight to the ice cream shop it was worth the whole trip just to eat a banana split with grandpa
has only five buttons and i can
go fish with me
i colored the dragon
that lights up so that the flight attendant would come but guess what i was too short to reach the button
she said they don't have any banana splits on the plane but sometimes people like to eat p peanuts on their banana splits
can't get past level three imagine how hard it would be to work all those millions
she said the captain was inviting me to the cockpit i thought awesome
deck of cards but she wouldn't play go fish with me
i've always thought flying was fun
that's when i missed my par parents the most
i wanted it to catch up to the red brown blue yellow purple and black ones
and had to go all the way from new york to texas without my parents
when i got off the airplane there was grandpa waiting for me
call her jennifer instead
even the flight
suddenly i thought wow look at all those buttons then i thought there's no way anyone can remember to push all those buttons at the right time
he said
i guess it was because the plane was so loud and i didn't know anyone
the first time i ever took an airplane by myself it was fun and scary
that's always scary because it seems like
i only used the green cr
even though we are on the ground that the plane is going to
she didn't like being called peanut lady but she didn't
that if she would get me a
the pilot told me that it wasn't really hard once you pra once you practiced
i was glad that there wasn't anyone next to me the person next to me would have been very annoyed
jennifer took me to the cockpit and there are like
then i could be a pilot too since i'm much better push
but to tell you the truth without my parents there i was pretty nervous
i tried to push the button that
but it was her fault
one thing about being by yourself on an airplane is that the
we were going fishing
pi a pilot and uh i'll only serve banana splits on my plane
i played on my game boy until i got my new high score and then jennifer came up to me
he he thought i would make a great pilot someday if

i said if you can't get past level one and you
finally we landed
so i started yelling hey peanut lady hey peanut lady

i don't know i didn't know anyone at all an
but she did get my game boy she told me to call

too fast to ever stop but it did
then he ho told me that he once played
banana split i wouldn't have to go the bathroom so much
there are like a million buttons and levers and knobs and stuff
at pushing buttons than you are he laughed even though i wasn't joking
i had a game boy in my pack backpack my backpack was in the o
my mom gave me a coloring book of cool looking dragons to keep me busy
for some reason she kept trying to give me peanuts but i told her that i would like a banana split instead
i thought great more peanuts but it wasn't peanuts it was something really cool
that one so it was boring the flight attendant gave me a
and she ha said she had a surprise
ge even get pass level one one
the way i figured it my game boy
i wanted to be he was really nice but wouldn't play
they got tons and tons of flies
doctor wong thought for a second then
then suddenly a fly landed on a little girl then a fly landed on someone else
coupes and cops and robbers
off and accidentally smashed it into pieces but
what should they do they can't keep john in jail and they want to kick him out of the out of town because they all have su
was shaped made for a flute
just when th just when
john thought that was an ok idea but there was no there was an echo in the well and that made the flute sound louder
actually smashed into a in wait
they just can't lead a normal they just can't lead a normal life
but it was too late john had started playing
but there can't keep john but they can't keep john in jail since he wasn't already breaking any laws so there was nothing the police could do
wait they can't they couldn't keep john in jail and they don't want to kick him out of town because they all have such nice teeth
shaped made his flute his flute sound awful
didn't know what to do he just kept
in franksville to celebrate the fact that for once there was no water problem no fly problem and
the bad the bad flute player was rooster john
maybe a poorly played flute doesn't sound all that bad about
before they knew it the town was filled with flies again
and the clarinet
and
of fleas
wait everybody looked really silly at dances dancing to music they couldn't hear
then pronounced it's the flute sound the flies hate john's flute playing as much as we do john the dentist is driving the flies away
then some landed on a bunch of people
he was very upset at first then he said oh well good thing i i brought my old flute as back up
they can't
awful the uhm however for the some reasons the way his mouth was shaped
things were going good in franksville john didn't
the people in the town decided to have a great big parade
windows were breaking all day and all the cows in town started to make so sour milk
when the townsfolk heard the noise they couldn't even swat at the flies anymore
since he had become the town den dentist everybody's teeth
the neighbors are complaining and the cats and dogs are trying to chew off their ears
but soon after that they started to get flies
they had to cover their ears from the horrible sound the flies would land all over the people and they couldn't swat them off
he wasn't called rooster john yet he that came later
no flute problem
oh that's a nice instrument but it's just not the flute i even wrote you a song chief sanders it's called
he started shaking the flute to get the flies off the
but just try to imagine someone scratching a chalkboard with a f with a fork fork and then multiply that times a hundred
however you however some for some reason the way his mouth was such
oh no said chief sanders
but i feel like i have to or else
den dentist
no one had any
i'm serious still i'll it's not a bad
then he played the song the
rooster john
doctor wong was the was the town hero the flute sounded normal and it turned to
everybody looked really silly at dances dancing to music they couldn't hear
then they decide to lower him down
look john you'll hear i've heard you play the clarinet you're quite good why don't you play that instead said chief sanders
a
so there was a problem in the little town of franksville
especially shaped for john's mouth then perhaps he could play a flute normally
besides everybody loved john
so they decide that john could play the flute and everybody else would have to wear earplugs
their problems started when they ran out of water thankfully someone was digging a hole and found water
we can't yet we can't let you play the flute anymore john said police chief s said police chief sanders
kept on playing his flute the flies were annoying so he would
the flies were annoying he could not he would swat at them with his hands or or even his new flute
or else bad things will happen
he was a excellent dentist but his real love was music he played many music musical instruments such as guitar the tuba the piano
then pretty soon ton tons of flies were landing on everyone
cavities and no one had any cavities
it was then that the people of franksville realized that they would have to take a good
the local scientist doctor wong ca came up with an idea he thought that if he made a new mouthpiece
it's not as bad as millions of fleas i suppose
the police chief hated the sound so much that he threw john in jail
no no please don't play your old flute begged doctor wong
then the fleas stopped but just then a man moved into the town who played a flute a flute so badly that people would run away screaming
and it turned out john could play it it quite well
a well and let him play down where you where no one could hear him
good with the bad because so bad as the flute sounded it was a lot better than thousands of flies crawling all over them
that sound that should that they should do that
and guess what it worked doctor
well i'm sure you guessed that i didn't that that didn't work nobody could hear anything people were getting into car accidents and
but i have to play i was born i was born to do it i don't know why
swat at them with his hands or
he was a new town
were much whiter then and cleaner then
it was gross then suddenly the flies fell flew away fa fast as they could
that's how the flute sounds when the guy when this guy played it
from then on john would wake up the sun at sunrise with like a rooster and play to keep the flies away
they snatched her purse and ran
he was bruce wayne the wealthiest man in gotham city
just in the nick of time
dick followed the stairs down to the darkness
an instant later he felt himself being yanked up
they ran h then he ran out into the street and jumped into a nearby manhole batman followed him
stone and steel began to rain on batman and the ground beneath his feet collapsed batman felt him sinking
two face's weapon sent a ball of fire hurtling toward batman
all right folks this is an old fashioned stick up
oh no one of the hoods screamed it's batman
batman and robin said batman i like the sound of that
the riddler decided that two face would make a perfect partner in crime
you thought you were on my
you'll crash the party and rob the guests when batman arrives to stop you he'll walk right into out trap
and there was the batmobile
from then on batman and robin would be partners tracking down two face the riddler and every other criminal in gotham city
whenever criminals tried to break the law batman was there to stop them
but just before batman's head disappeared below the sand
they worked so quickly no one could keep up with them
later batman said i told you no crime fighting
it could only mean one thing bruce wayne was batman
his gang members were so busy robbing everyone they didn't notice bruce wayne slip slip out of the room
in another part of a cr another p in another part of town a criminal genius called the riddler was also plotting against him
instantly his costume was covered in a fire proof coating
dick was an orphan and needed a place to live
it was two face carrying some kind of weapon
two face was one of the criminals batman had not yet er had not caught yet
dick couldn't believe his eyes he was inside the batcave
up and out of the pit
then two face walked away
down down do down down batman sank
two face and his gang committed crimes all over gotham city
the riddler tracked down two face and made an offer two face decided to flip a coin
but it was a trap two face pointed his weapon at batman and fired
the following night two face arrived at the party right on schedule
look one of the crooks shouted that ain't batman that's just a kid we can take him easy
when they launch launched a crime spree batman would swoop out of the sky on his batrope or roar down the street in his batmobile
a green glow had reached him had reached for him
late one night dick went searching for a clue
dick asked batman wh as they drove back to wayne manor
i think it's time we became partners since i just saved your life
meanwhile across town a gang gang of thugs had spotted a woman walking down the lonely streets of gotham city
an instant later a car came screeching
dick smiled
bruce oft often helped people one day he met a young circus acrobat named dick grayson
but batman would soon need help
the manhole led into an abandoned subway tunnel in the dim light batman could see someone was coming toward him
you'll be okay now dick told the woman
he discovered an underground cavern filled with crime fighting equipment
what's the plan
i expect you'll be buried alive two face s s two face said as batman sank deeper i'd love to stay and see you off but crime's a wastin' and i'm a very busy man
acting qui quickly batman pressed a button on his utility belt
batman forever
two face smiled
hit him full blast but batman was protected
you thought you were on my trail two face snarled
why can't we fight fight crime together
the hoodlums knew they were no match for batman but when the top of the batmobile opened they were surprised to see a young man
dick liked living in the mansion but he wondered where bruce went every day every evening
batman was only the was the onl wait kay batman was only one man to stop two face he would need help
aren't you glad i didn't listen dick answered
came to a screeching halt in front of them it was no ordinary car it was the batmobile
my folks used to say i flew like a bird on the flying trapeze so they called me robin
the ball of flame hit
while the riddler had the brains to outwit batman he didn't have the muscle to finish him
then a hand grabbed him and he was tossed into the batmobile it was batman and he was angry
tomorrow night all of gotham's richest people will be at a big party the riddler explained
batman was the greatest crime fighter in gotham city
i'm finished he thought there's no way to escape
bruce invited dick to stay in wayne manor
it was dick he had followed batman
begin phase two he whispered to his gang
meanwhile the explosive fireball shattered the tunnel walls
if it comes head if it comes up heads we'll join forces he explained the coin hit the ground landing heads up
but dick quickly proved them wrong he had spent years training as an acrobat he leaped and dived dived about kicking and punching then stunned the thugs in no time he had knocked them all out
he discovered a secret door that led to a flight of stairs
okay partner we have a deal two face said
when he wasn't fighting crime batman had a sec bat yeah batman had a secret identity
you're too young batman answered besides batman fights alone
easy money the hoods sneered as they crept up alongside her
okay batman said you've earned it but what are we going to call you
he told his parents i don't want any of these gifts i want to return them all and try to find a new perfect hat instead
and on his head once he even imagined himself as a grown up wearing the hat and speaking in front of many people
clean and perfect forever
it was just like he remembered
so the next day justin and his mother went shopping for hats and found the perfect one
on his next birthday he decided to wear the hat
but it'll it'll shrink if you wash it then it will be too small he said
something was wrong with
unfortunately justin was too smart for his own good he figured out that the hat would get
but justin would never wear the hat and that made his mom roll her eyes
he loved the color the size and the shape no the size the shape and the new hat smell
soon if we would be happy to buy you a new hat but only if you promise to wear it the father said

justin and his hat

he knew crying wouldn't help make the hat perfect again but he cried anyway

there were many presents but the only thing that made justin excited was getting to wear his hat
then when he got older he developed problems with his back legs
when he woke up from the surgery he didn't even remember where he was but soon his owners came came and drove him home
he would always come to racer and bite his legs and run away saying bark bark bark bark
fang was laughing because he knew racer could could never catch him
on on his way
have surgery for his legs
finally he ran back to his leg his owners and gave them a big kiss for fixing his legs
which meant why do you have to wear that that stupid looking collar
he enjoyed playing at the dog park because he didn't have to be on his leash
one day he took a walk to the dog park and his friends were there as usual
he thought oh boy i'm going to like lick my leg so hard that the itching is going to go away
one day racer went to the vet
and from that day on fang never bit racer's legs
but that didn't stop him from running because like most dogs racer loved to run
for six weeks racer could talk take walks and go to the dog park but he still had to be on a his leash
so i'm going to pick you on you
a few days later he went with his owners to the dog park
racer was running faster than he could ever remember
eventually racer didn't have to wear the collar but by the by then his legs didn't itch so he didn't want to lick them
just then fang bit him on the back leg and ran away racer's owners said go run
leg but there was a big white thing
racer did didn't know it but he was at the vet to
but his night it it was nice to see all his friends
racer the dog
every time he ran he would limp
on the drive home racer released
which in dog talk means you are too slow to catch me with that limp of yours
he was wearing a collar that made it impossible to lick his legs
but suddenly he noticed that racer was catching up to him
it sure does it sure does look silly
then his owners reached around his neck and took off the leash
when he was there s there so he could run as much as he liked
so he tried he turned his head around to lick his legs
racer was so happy that he could run fast
racer liked the vet because the people in white coats gave him treats
since he still needed to heal from his surgery
there was a dog park near near where he lived
realized that his legs itched very badly
racer said bark bark which in which in dog talk means don't pick on me any more fang
racer would always chase fang but he could never catch him
racer had to be on a leash
and before he knew it had caught up to fang and knocked him down
so racer started running and chasing fang
there was one dog at the dog park named fang
that he ran ran ran in circles
mean old fang said bark bark bark
when his owners got him as a puppy all he wanted to do was run and run so his owners named him racer
it wasn't that he didn't like the hat in fact he loved it he thought it was great
son we would be happy to buy you a new hat but only if you promise to wear it the father said

he knew crying wouldn't help make the hat perfect again but he cried anyway
sincerely danny
actually the truth is that i i by accident turned on the nose hair clipper
also i was going to sell the cat fur to buy my sister's jenny braces for her big stupid face
it's your fault really dad please don't read the next part
didn't mean she's really responsible
i should have
cats aren't aren't always nice just like my sister jenny isn't always nice
and did stupid things that's the last time i shave the cat to protect any stupid gerbils
plus i forgot to tell you that you should be blaming ms casper my science teacher
so it was really my father's day gift to him
so in conclusion i'm getting hungry and sorry for shaving the cat
for thinking so fast on my toes
i was afraid to tell you the r really re the really reason i shaved the cat was that i want to be a barber i need practice
those poor hair less cats that we saw on tv on the animal channel
but so what if it's winter i mean it'll be summer soon enough and i just wanted the cat to get used to the idea before it got really hot
if she if i had a cat i would teach her how to not i would to not shave itself that's for sure
you could take her on tv shows and get lots of money so that you can send jenny to college even if she is dumb li is a dumb little tattle tale
i couldn't buy him anything nice since it took away my allowance for when i shaved the neighbor's dog
ok
i kept saying no kitty no don't shave yourself
i know how much you hate him any always sneezing and stuff
you should be proud of me
i think sh she should brush h t brush her teeth twice tonight thats just my opinion though
but the realest reason i shaved my shaved the cat was to make a wig for
i just didn't want to see the cat getting all hot and uncomfortable and stuff
but my stupid sister never taught her cat how to listen so she just ignored me
she said that when we shave a cat a lot of a bunch of times her hair would grow back harder each time and soon
i couldn't help it anyways it was an accident and i didn't even do it on purpose
i saw that the cat was trying t to get the gerbils and you told us we couldn't hit animals so what so i didn't know what else to do
they just ran on that stupid wheel
since you have grounded me and told me to write down why i am sorry before i was allowed out of my room i am mad at you
oh sure it's easy to say that i should have just picked up the cat but those stupid gerbils didn't even thank me
i promise i'll do a better job then i did on the cat cause now i have what dad calls life experience
they are call called hairless cats
the only reason it hasn't come out for two weeks is because you guys made such a big deal about it
fine oscar can't really talk but if he could he would have said please shave the cat
just cause she's a good student didn't mean she's doesn't
how come jenny gets a cat and i get a stupid turtle anyway
and the cat was being chased by the turtle that ran right by the clippers and shaved herself
dear mom want dad know that the real reason i shaved the cat was that he's really sneeze sneezing around
the cat liked being shaved anyway so it didn't it do i don't see the big
can i get a dog
last night i saw that she didn't brush her teeth oh yeah i forgot to tell you you that
dear mom and dad jenny didn't brush her teeth last night
besides the real reason i shaved the cat was to keep it nice and cool
to make me do this because i wa it wasn't even my fault
she made us shave some something for science ask her
heres what happened as i remember it
dear mom and dad
i was afraid you wouldn't let me practice on my own head can i can practice by shaving jenny's head
ps if you would have brought her a a turtle i could've shaved it
i think it really liked it's haircut
i knew our cat would grow her fur back but some cats don't have hair
i don't have a good get i don't have to get good grades to know that you should teach a cat to shave itself
plus oscar my turtle told me to shave the cat
she's so good at school and you bought her a cat cause she's so responsible and stuff
so i thought i'd get rid of his fur he wouldn't sneeze and that you would have a better marriage
i don't see the big deal
get a dog please
i bet you didn't know something else did you know i wanted to be a barber
i think
she she's not so responsible after all
you guys will just probably say it's winter danny cats don't overheat in winter
i really didn't mean to sh shave the cat really i swear i swear
so i grabbed dad's nose hair clippers and shaved it
you wouldn't always take the cat's side if you knew the stuff he did to my poor turtle
i would like to start by saying that i think that you are very mean
not that i shaved the cat though
shaved it
poor kitty this and poor kitty that
they need f fur in the winter because i th think i swear that's the reason
plus if it weren't anyways cuddling with my sister so much maybe maybe she would have been enough
if it keeps hitting me on the shell and trying to roll me over when i leave the room you guys you guys never liked oscar as much as the cat anyway
turtles don't do anything except poke their heads out and be not cuddly
one day justin and his mother went shopping for hats and his

race racer the dog
on the drive home racer realized that his legs itched very badly
even eventually racer didn't have to wear the collar but by then his legs didn't itch
had to be on
there was one dog at the park named fang
fang was las laughing because he knew racer could never catch him but suddenly he noticed that racer was catching up to him
one day racer went to the vet
but it was nice to see all his friends
racer had
there was a dog in the park near where he lived
one day he took a a walk through the dog park and h his friends were there as usual
finally he ran back to his owners and gave h them a big kisses for fixing his legs
take walks and go to the dog park but he still had to be on a leash
he was wearing a collar that made it impossible to lick his legs
then when he got older he he developed problems with his back legs every time he ran he would limp
so he turned to his head around to lick his legs but there was a big white thing in his way
for six week weeks racer would
a leash since he still needed
and from that day on fang never bit racer's legs
racer didn't know it but he was at the vet to have surgery to fix his legs
which meant why do you have to wear that stupid looking collar
had to
just then fang bit him on the back leg and ran away racer's own owners said go run
which in dog talk means you are too slow to catch me with that limp of yours so i'm going to pick you on you racer
when his owners got him as a puppy all he wanted to do was run and run so his owners named him racer
he thought oh boy i'm going to lick my leg so hard that the itching is going to go away
that he
so he didn't want to lick them
racer was running faster than he could ever remember and before he knew it it ha
he would always come up to racer and bite his back legs and run away saying bark bark bark bark
racer liked the vet because the people in w in white costumes gave him treats
racer said bark bark which in dog talk means don't pick on me any more fang
mean old fang said bark bark bark bark
then his owners reached out around his neck and took off his leash
he didn't enjoyed playing at the dog park because he didn't have to be on his leash when he was
to fang and knocked him down
would always chase fang but he could never catch him
to heal from his surgery
a few days later he went with his owners to the dog park
but that didn't stop him from running because he like most dogs racer loved to run
and ran in circles
it he had caught up
when he woke up from the surgery he didn't he didn't even remember where he was but soon his owners came and drove him home
racer was so happy that he could run fast and
sure does look silly
so racer started running and chasing fang
there so he could run as much as he liked
justin replied i promise that if we find the perfect hat i'll wear it everyday
unfortunately justin was too smart for his own good
then slowly slid it on
once he even imagined himself as a grown up wearing the hat and speaking
justin could tell it wasn't perfect anymore
justin and his hat
to find a new perfect hat instead
there were many presents but the only thing that made justin was
he thought it was great
his parents looked at each other and knew that justin had learned a good lesson
from then on justin would never take it off and that made his mom roll her eyes
it was just like he remembered
in front of many people
he told his parents i don't want any of those gifts i want to return them all and try
if it gets dirty i'll wash it silly said his mother
he imagined the people whispering to themselves what a fine speaker he is and such a handsome hat too
but justin would never wear the hat and that made his mom roll her eyes
but justin didn't listen and everyday the hat sat in a clear plastic box so it wouldn't get dirty
excited was getting to wear his hat
he loved the color the size the shape and the new hat smell
he figured out that the hat would get dirty or lost if he wore it too much so he made a promise to himself that he would never wear it except on special days
so the next day justin and his mother went shopping for hats and found the perfect one
it was a little tight at first like it was supposed to be
he knew crying wouldn't help make the hat perfect again but he cried anyway
he wanted the hat to be clean and perfect forever
one day justin and his mother went shopping for hats and found the perfect one
his father said you should really wear the hat if you like it or else you will be sorry
but then he noticed that it wasn't stretching
son we
it totally fit his head he loved the way it was a little tight at first but then stretched to the perfect size
he was so happy that he couldn't help but smile
but it'll shrink if you wash it and then it'll be too small he said
i know it's just a hat he thought to himself but i sure do love it
on his next birthday he decided to wear the hat
it wasn't that he didn't like the hat in fact he loved it
sometimes justin would imagine himself walking around school with the hat on his head
something was wrong it was a little tight
he went to his room opened the plastic box and took the hat out very carefully
we would be happy to buy you a new hat but only if you promise to wear it the father said
he even liked the way his hair looked when he took the hat off
racer had to be on a leash since he needed to heal from the surgery but it was nice to see all of his friends
racer loved to run
racer was so happy that he could run faster then he ran in circles
fang was laughing because he knew racer couldn't could never catch him
when he woke up from the surgery he didn't even remember where he was but soon his under owner came and drove him home
one day he took a walk to the to the dog park
he would always come up to racer and bite his back legs and run away saying bark bark bark bark
it h he before he knew it he had caught up to fang and knocked him down
so he turned his head around to lick his leg but there was a big white thing around
which is in dog talk means you are too slow to catch me with that limp of yours so i am going to pick on you
when his owner got him as a puppy all he wanted to do was run run so his owner named him racer
eventually racer didn't have to wear the collar but but by then his legs didn't itch so much and wanted to and he didn't want to itch them lick them
