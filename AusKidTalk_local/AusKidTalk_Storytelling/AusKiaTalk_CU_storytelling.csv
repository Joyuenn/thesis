HE STARTED SHAKING THE FLUTE TO GET THE FLIES OFF AND ACCIDENTALLY SMASHED IT INTO PIECES HE WAS VERY UPSET AT FIRST
IN A
LEAD
HIS
THE NOISE THEY COULDN'T EVEN SWAT FLIES ANYMORE
TOWN BECAUSE THEY ALL HAD SUCH NICE TEETH
BEFORE THEY KNEW IT THE TOWN WAS FILLED WITH FLIES AGAIN
ECHO IN THE WELL THAT MADE THE FLUTE SOUND LOUDER
UP AT
WHEN
DON'T KNOW WHY BUT I FEEL LIKE I HAVE
SCRATCHING A CHALKBOARD WITH A FORK AND THEN
HE
IT'S CALLED COPS AND ROBBERS
THE PEOPLE OF FRANKSVILLE REALIZED THAT THEY WOULD
JOHN IN JAIL SINCE HE WASN'T REALLY BREAKING ANY LAWS SO THERE WAS NOTHING THE POLICE COULD DO BESIDES EVERY
SO HE
AND
THE PEOPLE IN THE TOWN DECIDED
BEGGED DR WONG
WHAT SHOULD THEY DO
A LITTLE GIRL THEN A FLY
SHERIFF SANDERS
S
THEY GOT TONS AND TONS OF FLIES
IN THE LITTLE TOWN OF FRANKSVILLE
DON'T PLAY YOUR OLD FLUTE
A WELL AND LET HIM PLAY DOWN THERE WHERE NO ONE COULD HEAR HIM
IT WAS
DIDN'T THAT DIDN'T WORK
THE TOWN OF FRANKSVILLE
THE LOCAL SCIENTIST DR WONG
BUT SOON AFTER THAT THEY STARTED TO GET FILES
HE WASN'T CALLED ROOSTER JOHN YET
BUT JUST TRY TO IMAGINE SOMEONE SCRATCHING AND
HE ALWAY
AND NO FLUTE PROBLEM
AND IT TURNED TURNED OUT JOHN COULD PLAY
UP AND DOWN THE MAIN STREET EVERYONE CHEERED
REASON
OH THAT'S A NICE INSTRUMENT BUT IT'S NOT BUT IT'S JUST NOT THE FLUTE
HE AND THE CATS AND DOGS ARE TRYING TO CHEW OFF THEIR EARS
FROM THEN ON JOHN WOULD WAKE UP
GOOD THING I BROUGHT MY OLD FLUTE AS A BACK AS BACK UP
SO THE
THE FLIES HATE JOHN'S FLUTE PLAYING AS MUCH AS WE DO
THEN THEY DECIDED TO
WELL I'M SURE YOU YOU GUESSED
THE FLIES WOULD LAND ALL OVER PEOPLE AND THEY COULDN'T SWAT IT OFF
IN TOWN STARTED MAKE TO MAKE MILK SOUR
TO PLAY
NEW WAS AN EXCELLENT DENTIST BUT HIS REAL LOVE WAS MUSIC
LOOK JOHN I'VE HEARD YOU PLAY THE CLARINET
SHAPED MADE A FUNNY MADE HAS FLUTE SOUND FUN AWFUL
THAT THEY WOULD HAVE TO TAKE
HATED THE SOUND SO MUCH THAT HE THREW JOHN IN JAI
THE FLIES WERE ANNOYING SO HE HAD TO SWAT THEM AS HE
THE TOWN DENTIST EVERYBODY'S TEETH WERE
THE STARS OF THE PARADE THEY WERE UP ON THE MAIN FLOAT
THOUGHT FOR A SECOND
JUST
TO HAVE
AND
WHEN THE TOWNS
THEN SOME LANDED ON A BUNCH OF PEOPLE
BUT THERE WAS
AND GUESS WHAT
THEN THEY
AN OK AN OK IDEA
THAT'S HOW THE FLUTE SOUNDED WHEN THIS GUY PLAYED IT
THE OTHER
HE THOUGHT THAT IF HE MADE UP A NEW MOUTHPIECE ESPECIALLY SHAPED
THAT THE BAD FLUTE PAYER PLAYER WAS ROOSTER JOHN
AND FOUND WATER
MAYBE A POORLY PLAYED FLUTE DOESN'T SOUND THAT BAD
S SANDERS SAID JUST WHEN A LITTLE WAS GOING GOOD FOR FRANKSVILLE
NO FLY PROBLEM AND NO AND THE FLUTE PROBLEM
THE FLUTE SOUNDED NORMAL
AS THEY MARCHED
HOWEVER FOR SOME
TO KEEP
PLAY THAT INSTEAD SAID SHERIFF SANDERS
THE NEIGHBORS ARE COMPLAINING
THOUSANDS OF CRAWLING FLIES ON THEM
THEN HE SAID OH WELL
AND NO ONE HAD ANY CAVITIES
IT'S THE FLUTE SOUNDS THAT
A NORMAL LIFE
SO THEY DECIDED THAT JOHN COULD PLAY THE FLUTE AND EVERYBODY ELSE WOULD HAVE TO WEAR EARPLUGS
THEY HAD TO COVER THEIR EARS FROM THE HORRIBLE SOUND
WINDOWS WERE BREAKING AND ALL THE COWS IN
OH NO CHIEF
HE KNEW HE WAS THE NEW TOWN DENTIST
LIKE A ROOSTER
TO OR ELSE BAD THINGS WILL HAPPEN
SHAPED
MULTIPLY
HAVE
THEN HE PLAYED THE SONG THE POLICE CHAIR SHERIFF
JUST KEPT ON PLAYING HIS FLUTE
EVERYBODY LOVED JOHN SINCE THE SINCE HE HAD BECOME
AS FAST AS THEY COULD DR WONG
AT DANCES DANCING TO THE MUSIC THEY COULDN'T HEAR
JOHN WERE
THEY COULDN'T KEEP JOHN IN JAIL THEY
I BUT IT WAS TOO LATE JOHN HAD STARTED PLAYING
T
THEN A FLY LANDED ON SOMEONE ELSE
THEN
JOHN THOUGHT THERE THAT WAS
NO ONE COULD HEAR ANYTHING PEOPLE WERE GETTING INTO CAR ACCIDENTS AND EVERYBODY LOOKED REALLY SILLY AT DANCES
GROSS SUDDENLY THE FLIES FLEW AWAY
MULTIPLY THAT THAT TIMES A HUNDRED
FRANKSVILLE WAS A TOWN THAT SEEMED TO HAVE A PROBLEM AFTER
CAME UP WITH AN IDEA
THAT CAME LATER
FLIES
I DON'T KNOW WHY
THE WAY HIS MOUTH WAS SHAPED
AT
IT WAS THAT IT WAS THEN THAT
BUT THEY COULDN'T KEEP
JOHN DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TO DO
DR WONG
IT QUITE WELL
SOME THEN SUDDENLY A FLY LANDED ON
THE FLIES AWAY
I EVEN WROTE A S YOU A SONG
BUT I HAVE TO PLAY I WAS BORN TO DO IT
AND STRINGS STRINGS OF
SO THERE WAS A PROBLEM
NO NO PLEASE
LOWER HIM DOWN
JOHN THE DENTIST IS DRIVING THE FLIES AWAY
THEY COULDN'T SWAT THEM OFF
THAT
BEFORE I TELL YOU HOW ROOSTER JOHN GOT HIS NAME YOU SHOULD KNOW A LITTLE BIT ABOUT
LOCAL
HE PLAYED MANY MUSICAL INSTRUMENTS SUCH AS THE GUITAR
THE FLUTE
YOU'RE QUITE GOOD
WE CAN'T LET YOU PLAY THE FLUTE ANYMORE JOHN
THE GOOD WITH THE BAD
MUCH WHITER AND CLEANER
WITH HIS HAND OR EVEN HIS NEW FLUTE
PERHAPS HE COULD PLAY THE FLUTE NORMALLY
THEY JUST COULDN'T
THEN UHM PRONOUNCED
BUT
WHEN THE TOWNSFOLK HEARD THE
THEY DIDN'T WANT TO KICK HIM OUT OF
A GREAT BIG PARADE
AN
PRETTY SOON TONS OF FLIES WERE LANDING ON EVERYBODY
IN FRANKSVILLE TO CELEBRATE THE FACT FOR ONCE THERE WAS NO PROBLEM
IT WORKED DR DR WONG

FLEABAG DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TO DO BECAUSE HE HAD BEEN ON HIS LEASH SO LONG JUST THEN SNOT
FLEABAG PLAY WITHOUT THE LEASH SINCE HE STILL
FLEABAG CAME HE WOULD SOMETIMES GET A YUMMY
BECAUSE HE KNEW FLEABAG COULD NEVER CATCH HIM
VET
HE WAS ALLOWED TO RUN SO
WHICH MEANS IN DOG TALK WHY DO YOU HAVE TO WEAR MY STUPID LOOKING COLLAR
BE LET OFF HIS LEASH WHEN
S
TO LICK HIS LEGS BUT THERE WAS A BIG WHITE
THAT MADE HIM
EVENTUALLY
HIS BACK LEG AND RUN AWAY SAYING BARK BARK BARK
ONE DAY FLEABAG WENT TO THE VET
WHICH IN DOG TALK MEANS DON'T YOU EVER MISS
SPRINTED
YOUR
THERE WAS A DOG PARK NEAR WHERE HE LIVED HE ENJOYED PLAYING WITH THE OTHER DOGS BECAUSE HE DIDN'T
OWED
TO SEE ALL HIS FRIENDS MEAN OLD SNOT

ITCHED VERY BADLY HE THOUGHT
A PUPPY
GAVE HIM A TREAT
ON
FAIRLY

HE
HE KNEW IT FLEABAG RAN INTO
DO YOU LOOK SILLY IN THAT UGLY COLLAR HA HA
HE WAS WEARING A COLLAR THAT MADE IT IMPOSSIBLE TO LICK
IT'S HARD TO
BAG
WHEN HE RAN
REALIZE WHICH MEANT HE WAS
HIM UP AND DROVE HIM HOME
THE COLLAR
WHICH IN DOG TALK MEANS YOU'RE ARE S TOO SLOW TO CATCH ME WITH YOUR LIMP
VET BECAUSE UNUSUALLY THE PEOPLE IN THE WHITE
ITS LEGS THEN IT LEGS
AS USUAL
HE WAS SO HAPPY THAT HE COULD RUN FAST
GAVE THEM BIG KISSES
HIS BACK
WOULD ALWAYS FLEABAG
THERE WAS ONE DOG NAMED SNOT
BARK

HE THOUGHT
THAT
AND GO TO THE DOG PARK BUT HE
FLEABAG
WHAT
OWNERS NAMED HIM FLEABAG
THE DOG PARK
AND TOOK A
NEEDED TO
BIT HIM ON THE BACK LEG AND RAN AWAY
BUT SUDDENLY HE NOTICED THAT FLEABAG WAS CATCHING UP TO HIM AND BEFORE
TO HAVE S SURGERY ON HIS LEGS WHEN HE AWOKE
BOY
FLEABAG STARTED RUNNING AFTER SNOT
WHICH MADE HIM
S
THING IN HIS WAY
LIMP
FLEABAG GOT TO TAKE
FROM THE SURGERY HE DIDN'T REMEMBER WHERE HE WAS BUT HE SURE DID WANT TO SEE HIS OWNERS SOON THEY CAME AND PICKED
BARK
FLEABAG DIDN'T MIND THE V
A LITTLE MAD AT HIS OWNERS ONE DAY HE TOOK A WALK TO THE DOG PARK AND ALL HIS FRIENDS WERE THERE
MISS WITH ME AGAIN SNOT FLEABAG WAS ABLE TO RUN FASTER THAN HE COULD EVER REMEMBER
TO HIS OWNERS AND GAVE THEM A
WAS A PUPPY HE WAS OLDER NOW AND HAD PROBLEMS WITH

SAID BARK
ALL
THE LEGS DIDN'T ITCH SO HE DIDN'T WANT TO LICK THEM FOR SIX WEEKS HE COULD TAKE WALKS
OH

TS
HIS OWNERS REACHED AROUND THE BAG
OWNERS ON HIS LEASH AND THEY WENT TO
HEAL BUT
HIM AND KNOCKED HIM DOWN AND SAID BARK BARK BARK
HA HA HA
IT'S HARD TO S
THAT WAS A LONG TIME AGO WHEN
LIKE MOST DOGS HE LOVED TO RUN
ALL
IT ALWAYS IT WAS NICE
BUT THAT DIDN'T STOP HIM FROM RUNNING
FLEABAG SUDDENLY REALIZED THAT HIS LEGS

COATS
SO I'M GOING TO PICK UP
M AS
THE NEXT DAY HE

THAT WOULD ALWAYS COME UP TO FLEABAG AND BITE

BARK BARK
OH BOY I'M GOING TO LICK MY LEG SO HARD THAT THE ITCHING IS GOING TO GO AWAY SO HE TURNED HIS HEAD AROUND
HE SPRAINED S
COULDN'T
WAS AT THE V
HE SOON LEARNED THAT WHENEVER HIS OWNER SAID
LA
HIS OWNERS WOULDN'T LET
HIS LEASH OFF
WHY I AM SORRY BEFORE I WAS ALLOWED
B
MY TOES
I'LL BET YOU DIDN'T KNOW SOMETHING ELSE
THE GERBILS
NEED FUR IN THE WINTER SOMETIMES I THINK
JUST CAUSE SHE'S A GOOD STUDENT DIDN'T MEAN SHE'S REALLY RESPONSIBLE
TO THE CAT TO GET THE CAT
AND
MRS
IF I HAD A CAT I WOULD TEACH IT
AND NOT BE CUDDLE
LAST NIGHT I SAW
OF
HARDER EACH TIME AND SOON HAVE AN INCREDIBLE COAT
THE CAT LIKED BEING SHAVED ANYWAY
HAVE SHAVED IT
DAD PLEASE DON'T READ THE NEXT PART
BY THE CLIPPERS AND SHAVED HERSELF I KEPT SAYING NO KITTY NO DON'T SHAVE YOURSELF
AWAY ALL MY ALLOWANCE WHEN I SHAVED THE NEIGHBOR'S DOG
IT
PLUS IF YOU WEREN'T ALWAYS
THAT WE SAW ON T V
TO MAKING ME DO THIS BECAUSE IT WASN'T MY FAULT
ALL THAT GREAT UNDER PRESSURE AND
MY SISTER JENNY
KNOW WHAT ELSE TO DO SO I GRABBED DAD'S
SEE THE CAT GETTING ALL HOT AND UNCOMFORTABLE AND STUFF
DEAR MOM AND DAD PARENTS
YOU WOULDN'T ALWAYS TAKE THE CAT'S
WHEN WE SHAVE IT HAIR IT GROWS BACK
I'M GETTING HUNGRY AND I'M SORRY FOR SHAVING THE CAT
I THINK THAT SHOULD BE BRUSH HER TEETH TWICE TONIGHT
I COULDN'T BUY HIM ANYTHING NICE SINCE YOU TOOK
ON THE ANIMAL CHANNEL
AND GET LOTS OF MONEY SO THAT YOU CAN SEND JENNY TO COLLEGE EVEN IF SH SHE HAS
AND POOR KITTY THAT IS YOUR FAULT REALLY
BUT SO WHAT
CAUSE KNOW I HAVE
ACTUALLY THE TRUTH IS THAT I BY ACCIDENT TURNED THE NOISE HAIR CLIPPERS AND THE CAT WAS BEING CHASED BY THE TURTLE
I WOULD LIKE TO START BY SAYING THAT I THINK
TO MAKE
OH SURE IT'S EASY TO SAY THAT I SHOULDN'T HAVE JUST PICKED THE CAT
AND YOU TOLD US WE COULDN'T HIT THE ANIMALS
I WAS GOING TO SELL THE CAT FUR
PLUS OSCAR MY TURTLE TOLD ME TO SHAVE THE CAT
BESIDES THE REAL REASON I SHAVED THE CAT WAS TO KEEP IT NICE AND COOL
SHE MADE US SAVE SHAVE SOMETHING FOR SCIENCE ASK HER
I CAN GET CAN I GET A DOG PLEASE
THAT'S FOR SURE I DON'T
THAT
MY FATHER'S DAY TO GI
THEN SHE WOULD BE SUPER CAT AND YOU COULD TAKE HER
DANNY
YOU GUYS WILL JUST PROBABLY SAY IT'S WINTER DANNY CATS DON'T
THE ONLY REASON IT HASN'T COME OUT FOR TWO WEEKS IS BECAUSE YOU GUYS MADE SUCH A BIG DEAL ABOUT IT POOR KITTY
MY OWN HEAD I CAN PRACTICE BY SHAVING JENNY'S HEAD
PLUS I FORGOT TO TELL YOU
A CATS GET
HOW TO LISTEN SHE JUST GOT IGNORED SHE JUST IGNORED ME
N I KNOW HOW MUCH YOU HATE HIM ALWAYS SNEEZING AND STUFF SO I THOUGHT IF I GET RID OF THIS F
P S IF YOU HAVE
YOU WOULD HAVE BEEN WITH HER CAT INSTEAD
GERBILS DIDN'T EVEN
YOU COULD
AND SOMETIMES EVEN DARKER SO I THOUGHT IF WE COULD SHAVE
TOLD
DID TO ME POOR TURTLE
THOUGH I'LL OPINION THOUGH
YOU SHOULD BE PROUD FOR
SHE'S GOOD AT SCHOOL AND YOU BOUGHT
OK HERE IS WHAT HAPPENED AS I REMEMBER IT
WOULD GROW FUR BACK BUT SOME CATS DON'T
AND I'LL JUST
THAT I SHAVED THE CAT THOUGH
OUT OF MY ROOM I AM MAD AT YOU
REALEST REASON I SHAVED THE CAT WAS
DID YOU KNOW THAT I WANTED TO BE A BARBER I WAS AFRAID TO TELL YOU A A REASON I SHAVED THE CAT WAS I WANTED TO BE A BARBER AND I NEEDED TO PRACTICE I WAS AFRAID IF YOU WOULDN'T PRACTICE
OH SURE THINKING
I SWEAR THAT'S THE REASON
DID STUPID THINGS THAT'S WHY THE LAST TIME I SHAVE THE CAT TO PROTECT ANY STUPID GERBILS
USED TO THE IDEA BEFORE IT GOT REALLY HOT
CASPER MY SCIENCE TEACHER
THAT SHE DIDN'T BRUSH HER TEETH OH YEAH I FORGOT TO TELL YOU
TO TO NOT SHAVE ITSELF
CUDDLY
OF CAT FUR ARMOR
BITTER MARRIAGE SO IT'S REALLY M
ON M
SO DON'T SEE THE BIG DEAL I THINK IT REALLY LIKED ITS HAIRCUT
SINCERELY
BUT MY STUPID SISTER NEVER TAUGHT HER CAT
HOW COME
HE'S ALWAYS SNEEZING AROUND IT
CUDDLING WITH MY SISTER SO MUCH MAYBE
YOU ALWAYS S S SAY AND NOT BRUSHING HER TEETH
I COULDN'T HELP IT ANYWAY
AND YOU KNOW WHAT THOSE STUPID
BRACES FOR HER BIG STUPID FACE
NOISE HAIR CLIPPERS AND SHAVED IT
HARDER
SINCE YOU HAVE GROUNDED ME AND
SIDE IF YOU KNEW THE STUFF
THAT'S JUST MY OPINION
ALTHOUGH YOU CAN SEE IT'S REALLY JENNY'S FAULT FOR BEING AS RESPONSIBLE AS
IS A DUMB LITTLE TATTLE TALE
IT WAS AN A ACCIDENT AND I DIDN'T EVEN DO IT ON PURPOSE I REALLY DIDN'T MEAN TO S SHAVE THE CAT REALLY I SWEAR
I KNEW OUR CAT
WHAT DAD CALLS LIFE EXPERIENCE NOT WHAT
IF IT'S WINTER I MEAN IT'LL BE SUMMER SOON ENOUGH
AND RAN RIGHT
DEAR MOM A DEAR MOM DON'T LET DAD KNOW THAT I THE REAL REASON I SHAVED THE CAT WAS HE ALWAYS
TO KNOW THAT YOU SHOULD TEACH A CAT TO SHAVE ITSELF
A WIG FOR THOSE POOR HAIR L HAIRLESS CATS
YOU ARE VERY MEAN
UP BUT SOMETIMES WE DON'T ALWAYS THINK
BUY
SO WE DIDN'T
I JUST WANTED TO
FINE OSCAR CAN'T REALLY TALK BUT IF HE COULD HE WOULD SAID PLEASE SHAVE THE CAT IT CAT IT KEEPS HITTING ME ON THE SHELL AND TRYING TO ROLL ME OVER
WHEN YOU LEAVE THE ROOM YOU GUYS NEVER LIKED OSCAR AS MUCH AS THE CAT ANYWAY
SHE SAID THAT WE
DEAR MOM AND DAD JENNY DIDN'T BRUSH HER TEETH LAST NIGHT
T C
HAVE TO GET GOOD GRADES
ON T V SHOWS
FATHER'S DAY GIFT TO HIM
PROMISE THAT I'LL DO A BETTER JOB THEN I DID THE CAT CAUSE I KNOW
OVERHEAT IN THE WINTER
THIS
SHOULD BE BLAME THAT YOU SHOULD BE BLAMING
A CAT AND I GET STUPID TURTLE ANYWAY TURTLES DON'T DO ANYTHING EXCEPT POKE THEIR HEADS OUT
SEE SHE'S NOT SO RESPONSIBLE AFTER ALL
A BUNCH OF TIMES HAIR WOULD GROW BACK
HIS FUR HE WON'T SNEEZE AND YOU WOULDN'T HAVE
IF YOU'D HAVE BOUGHT HER A TURTLE I COULDN'T
THAT CAT CAME INTO MY ROOM BECAUSE JENNY NEVER PLAYS WITH IT ENOUGH
THANK ME THEY JUST RAN

RAMONA AND RITA SAT ON THE BACK PORCH OF THEIR NEW HOME THEY HAD MOVED THE COUNTRY JUST THEY MOVED TO THE COUNTRY JUST TWO WEEKS AGO RAMONA STILL MISSED THE CITY
RITA BEGAN TO LAUGH IT'S NOT SPOOKY SHE SAID IT'S JUST
WELL THE AIR INSIDE THE BOTTLE MOVES BACK AND FORTH VERY QUICKLY MOM ANSWERED THESE MOVEMENTS ARE CALLED VIBRATIONS
NO
I
WALKED OVER TO THE EMPTY BOTTLES ON THE PORCH RITA FOLLOWED HE PICKED UP A BOTTLE AND BLEW ACROSS THE TOP OF IT
AND VIBRATIONS MAKE THE SOUNDS RIGHT ASKED
WHEN THEY HEARD SOMETHING
EVERYONE LOOKED AROUND WHERE IS THAT AWFUL NOISE COMING FROM ASKED MOM I NEVER HEARD A SOUND LIKE THAT IN NEW YORK RITA WHISPERED RAMON WAS STANDING NEAR THE FIREPLACE
LET'S TRY THEM SAID DAD EACH BOTTLE MADE A DIFFERENT SOUND
RAMON WALKED OVER TO THE EMPTY
SEVERAL BOXES SAT AT THE KITCHEN FLOOR MOM WAS TAKING DISHES OUT OF ONE BOX AND PUTTING THEM AWAY WHEN YOU BLOW ACROSS THE TOP OF A BOTTLE MOM EXPLAINED THE AIR INSIDE THE BOTTLE VIBRATES
IT'S THUNDER SAID MOM THERE MUST BE A STORM
SHE FELT SILLY FOR THINKING
THERE IS MORE ROOM INSIDE IT THE AIR TO VIBRATE A SHORTER BOTTLE MAKES A HIGHER SOUND
THE SOUND STOPS WHEN THE WIND STOPS IT STARTS WHEN THE WIND BLOWS IT'S THE HOUSE THAT'S MAKING THE NOISE I DON'T LIKE IT RAMON SAID RITA
TYING STRING ONTO A KITE
AS IF TO PROVE THAT THEY HAD SEEN THE WIND BLEW AGAIN THE HOUSE GROANED
LOOK KIDS HE SAID I CAN SHOW YOU WHAT VIBRATIONS ARE HE HELD A RUBBER BAND IN HIS HAND DAD PULLED THE RUBBER BAND TIGHT BETWEEN TWO FINGERS PULL THE RUBBER BAND RITA HE SAID AND THEN LET IT GO
JUST LISTEN RAMONA
HE HEARD COWBELLS RINGING FROM THE FARM DOWN THE ROAD HE HEARD THE SOFT SOUND OF WIND BLOWING THROUGH THE TREES
RAMON WATCHED RITA PULL THE RUBBER BAND AND LET GO IT MOVED QUICKLY IT MADE A FUNNY SOUND DID YOU SEE THE RUBBER BAND VIBRATE ASKED DAD IT MOVED BACK AND FORTH VERY FAST AND MADE IT THE AIR AROUND IT MOVE VERY FAST THE AIR MOVING BACK AND FORTH THOSE MOVEMENTS ARE VIBRATIONS RIGHT ASKED RAMON
RAMON AND RITA PICKED UP THE BOTTLES AND FOLLOWED THEIR MOTHER INTO THE HOUSE
WE'D BETTER SHUT THE WINDOWS RAMON AND RITA RACED TO CLOSE THE WINDOWS DAD CLOSED THE DOOR THEY FINISHED JUST IN TIME THE WIND STARTED BLOWING HARDER SUDDENLY THE HOUSE REALLY DID BEGIN TO GROAN
THEY HEARD THE SOUND AGAIN THIS TIME RAMON KNEW IT WHAT IT WAS
WILL THEY ALL MAKE DIFFERENT SOUNDS
WHY DOES THE BOTTLE MAKE THAT SOUND MOM ASKED RITA
THEN A NEW SOUND FILLED THE ROOM
MAYBE IT'S THE WIND SAID RAMON
AND THAT'S HOW WE HEAR SOUNDS RITA PICKED UP A BOTTLE IT WAS SHORTER THAN THE OTHERS SHE BLEW IT ACROSS THE TOP OF IT THAT BOTTLE SOUNDS LIKE A WHISTLE SAID RAMON THAT'S RIGHT SAID DAD A TALL BOTTLE MAKES A DEEP SOUND
HE MISSED THEIR OLD SCHOOL HE MISSED PLAYING WITH HIS FRIENDS ON THEIR STREET RITA FINISHED
THE CHIMNEY THE CHIMNEY IS LIKE A GIANT BOTTLE WHEN THE WIND BLOWS OVER IT THE AIR INSIDE VIBRATES AND BECAUSE IT'S SO TALL IT MAKES A REALLY DEEP SOUND RAMON ADDED I THINK RAMON AND RITA ARE RIGHT LAUGHED MOM
DAD CAME INTO THE ROOM
RAMON
THERE IT WAS THAT STRANGE SOUND
TOLD YOU THERE WERE LOTS OF THINGS TO HEAR
STRANGE WHAT WAS THAT ASKED RITA I DON'T KNOW RAMON RA
RIGHT ASKED RITA MOM SMILED YOU'RE BOTH RIGHT SHE SAID THOSE VIBRATIONS MOVE THROUGH THE AIR INTO OUR EARS MOM EXPLAINED
WHEN THEY HEARD THE GROAN AGAIN I THINK IT'S COMING FROM THE FIREPLACE HE SAID THE FIREPLACE IS MAKING THAT SPOOKY SOUND THE WIND SLOWED DOWN FOR A MOMENT THEN HOUSE BECAME QUIET AGAIN
WHAT DOES VIBRATE MEAN ASKED RAMON
THAT THE HOUSE HAD GROANED COME INSIDE SAID THEIR MOTHER WE CAN TALK WHILE I WORK
THE WIND
IT HAS LESS ROOM INSIDE FOR THE AIR TO VIBRATE
WHAT A GREAT DAY FOR FLYING A KITE SHE SMILED AT HER BROTHER JUST LISTEN TO THE WIND IN THE TREES I HATE THE COUNTRY RAMONA SAID IT'S TOO QUIET HERE
IT LOOKED AS IF NEITHER OF THEM HAD MOVED AT ALL
TO BREAK THIS RULE WOULD MEAN AN END TO THE GREAT TURTLE RACE FOREVER
THEY LOOKED AT THE HORIZON
SWISH'S FATHER SAID SON I HAVE SOMETHING TO TELL YOU
FASTER THAN YOU
TO THEIR LITTLE POND
THE MAYOR SAY RUNNER'S PLEASE TAKE YOUR POSITIONS THE SLOWEST TURTLES FROM EACH POND WERE CARRIED TO THE STARTING
TO RACE
THE CROWD THOUGHT HE MUST HAVE REALIZED
FESTIVAL
RACE THAT WAS THE MOST EXCITING FINISH WE'VE EVER HAD
THEN MUD TRIED
BLUE POND BECAME
FOR
THE TURTLE CUP TO SLUDGE POND AGAIN
LEGENDS ABOUT HIM
MUD DIDN'T ANSWER THE MAYOR TAPPED MUD
EVERYONE THOUGHT HE WAS A LITTLE SLOW BUT AS HE GOT A LITTLE OLDER THE TURTLES BEGAN TO REALIZE THAT SWISH WAS REALLY REALLY REALLY SLOW
RULE NUMBER FOUR NO TURTLE MAY FALL ASLEEP
WITHOUT HIM WE DON'T HAVE A CHANCE BUT HE DOESN'T WANT TO BE TREATED SPECIAL HE JUST WANTS TO BE NORMAL AND HE DOESN'T WANT EVERYBODY TO HATE HIM IF HE CAN'T BEAT MUD
HE HAD EVER SEEN
AND ALL THESE TURTLES WILL KNOW THAT BLUE POND RULES
THEY ARE NICE TO ME NOW BECAUSE THEY THINK I CAN WIN THE RACE BUT IF I LOSE
STARTED TOWARD GREAT POND
THE GREAT RACE BEGINS AT SUNRISE AND ENDS AT SUNSET
BUT THIS TIME SWISH WAS JUST AS SLOW
FOR SWISH THEY WERE VERY PROUD HE GAVE MUD SUCH
THERE WAS
THE TRICKS THAT HIS
A FREE SHELL WAXING TODAY
OUT OF THE FIELD
THAN YOU WOULD HAVE LIKED
CHAMPION IN THE HISTORY OF SHELL DWELLER'S FESTIVAL
THE MAYOR DR SOFTSHELL SAID THIS IS RIDICULOUS
SWISH
BUT THE MAIN THAT EVENT WAS THE GREAT TURTLE RACE THE WINNER OF THE GREAT TURTLE RACE WAS SO IMPORTANT THAT HE OR OR SHE DIDN'T HAVE TO MOVE FOR FOUR YEARS UNTIL THE NEXT FESTIVAL
FOR THE FIRST TIME IN SIX HUNDRED YEARS
HE WAS TIRED
BUT HE WAS GOING TO GIVE SWISH A FREE
BECAME THE GREATEST HE BECAME THE GREATEST AND BIGGEST TURTLE OF ALL TIME MUCH GREATER OR BIGGER THAN MUD HE ALWAYS MADE
EVERY FOUR YEARS TURTLES FROM ALL OVER THE LAND WOULD CRAWL TO THE GREAT POND
THE TURTLE CUP AGAIN THIS TIME IT WAS A BIT CLOSER
BUT SWISH WOULDN'T LET MUD SCARE HIM
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN
SWISH READ THE RULES EVEN
PEEK A BOO FROM BIG PUDDLE VILLAGE
THE TURTLES ALL STRETCHED AND THOUGHT REALLY SLOW THOUGHTS
WE ALL WANT YOU TO LOOK GOOD WHEN YOU BRING HOME THE CUP MRS S SNAPPER WOULD SAY
IT WOULD TAKE SOME TURTLES
AT GREAT POND
ALL TURTLES MUST GO AS FAST AS THEY
ALL THE TURTLES WERE VERY VERY SLOW
TIED AND HAD ONLY MOVED A FEW INCHES
THERE RISE JUST THEN THE MAYOR SAID READY SET SLOW AND OFF THEY WENT
SWISH'S EAR
MR PEEKS THE LOCAL SHELL CLEANER WOULD SAY
YOU'RE GOING TO RUIN THE GREAT RACE FOREVER
SWISH SAW A ROCK IN THE MIDDLE OF THE FIELD AND WONDERED
HIS NAME WAS MUD
ONCE IT TOOK HIM THREE DAYS JUST TO YAWN
FOR MANY YEARS SINCE TURTLES ONLY GET
BUT THEN RIGHT AS THE END
TURTLES COULD CATCH UP WITH FRIENDS THEY HAD NOT SEEN SINCE THE LAST FESTIVAL
HE STARTED SINGING A SOFT BEAUTIFUL B
HE WOULD NEVER LOSE THE TURTLE CUP FOR THE REST OF HIS LONG LIFE
MRS PEEKS
THE REAL WINNER IS SWISH
WELL MUD IT LOOKS LIKE
HIS HEART WOULD ONLY BEAT BEAT ONCE A DAY
MUD STILL DIDN'T ANSWER IN FACT MUD WAS SOUND ASLEEP
AND HE DIDN'T MAKE IT HOME UNTIL
YOU ARE ASLEEP
AT BE BEING SLOW
ALL HAVING A GREAT TIME
THE WERE
THE RACE I CAN'T BEAT MUD ANYWAY I HEARD
HIM MONTHS TO GET TO GREAT POND BY HIMSELF
RULE NUMBER THREE NO TURTLE MAY PRETEND TO
DIS
SWISH WAS T HAPPY TOO BUT DEEP DOWN INSIDE HE KNEW HE WAS JUST AS SLOW AS MUD
AFTER SEVEN DAYS OF PLAYING AND DANCING AND BUG EATING FINALLY THE DAY OF THE RACE CA CAME THE MAYOR OF THE GREAT POND MISS
HE HADN'T HAD TO MOVE FOR OVER FIFTY YEARS HE WAS THE BIGGEST MOST RESPECTED AND ALSO ONE OF THE TRICKIEST TURTLES THERE WAS THERE WAS
THAT'S NOT A ROCK SWEETIE S SAID HIS MOM THAT'S MUD
WHAT WOULD YOU LIKE TO SAY
WHEN MUD
SHELL DWELLERS FESTIVAL
HAS HEARD RACE HE'S THE SLOWEST TURTLE I'VE EVERY SEEN
SWISH TOOK THE CUP THAT DAY F FOR THE FIRST TIME
OH NO SHOUTED THE FANS MUD'S WINNING IT LOOKS LIKE MUD IS STILL THE GREATEST TURTLE OF THEM ALL
TREATED HIM SPECIAL
AND AFTER A WHILE SWISH DECIDED THAT HE WOULD BE PROUD TO RACE FOR HIS VILLAGE AND THE TIME OF THE FESTIVAL
THIS WAS THE KIND OF THING THAT SWISH WOULD GET ALL THE TIME
MRS T
HE REACHED IN HIS SHELL AND PULLED OUT A COUPLE OF EARPLUGS
I'M NOT GOING TO FALL FOR YOUR TRICKS HE SAID
SO YOU CAN SEE WINNING THE GREAT
AND WHEN THE SUN WENT DOWN MUD WAS THE CLOSEST TURTLE TO THE STARTING LINE
HUNDRED YEARS SO WITH SWISH THEY THOUGHT MAYBE JUST
THEM BY HEART
MUD SAID TO SWISH THERE'S NO WAY THAT A TURTLE AS YOUNG
SWISH'S MOM SMILED AND SAID
SWISH WAS SUDDENLY VERY EXCITED HE TOLD HIS MOM S
YOU DOWN FOR THE BIG RACE A FAT TURTLE IS A SLOW TURTLE
DID THE SKY TURNED
FIRST EVER
MOST OF THE TURTLES HAD GONE A FEW FEET ALL EXCEPT TWO SWISH AND MUD
ALL AT ALL TIMES
THEY WERE BOTH MOVING OF COURSE BUT THEY WERE S SO SLOW THAT IT WAS HARDLY TO TELL AFTER SIX HOURS MUD AND SWISH WERE STILL
AS YOU KNOW IT YOUR GREAT GREAT GRAND TURTLE RACED MUD ONCE HE WASN'T AS SLOW AS YOU BUT HE DID TEACH ABOUT MUD'S DIRTY TRICKS THEN YOU WHISPERED IN
THE TURTLE CUP WAS THE TROPHY THAT THE WINNER WOULD TAKE HOME IN THEIR VILLAGE
AND SAW THE SUN WAS STARTING
SAID SWISH'S MOM
WHEN I WAS YOUR AGE YOU'RE CHEATING
EVERYONE TREATED SWISH DIFFERENTLY FOR EXAMPLE
LINE BY MEMBERS OF THEIR VILLAGES
THAT HIS SINGING TRICK WASN'T WORKING
WHERE THERE WAS LOTS OF EATING AND LAUGHING
I THINK THAT YOU'LL BE A GREAT CHAMPION
ANOTHER TRICK
THIS SNAPPER WAS NEVER NICE TO ANYONE BUT SHE WAS BEING NICE TO SWISH
THE MOST RESPECTED POND IN THE LAND
SLEEPING DURING THE RACE THIS MEANS THAT WE HAVE A NEW CHAMPION
IT WAS R MORNING HE WAS SO SLOW
THERE WAS LOTS OF EATING AND L
SHE ANNOUNCED
ONCE HIS MOTHER CALLED HIM IN FOR DINNER
ON THE SHELL AND SAID HELLO HELLO MUD
YOU HAVE TO REMEMBER THAT EVEN THOUGH HE'S GIFTED
THERE WERE THOUSANDS OF TURTLES ALL OF ALL DIFFERENT S SPICES
SINCE IF
I'M NOT AFRAID OF STUPID MUD
THERE WERE ABOUT THREE HUNDRED TURTLES RACING
RULE NUMBER TWO ALL TURTLES MUST RUN AS FAST AS THEY CAN AND THE TURTLE THAT IS CLOSEST TO THE STARTING LINE WINS
THEY'LL BE DISAPPOINTED AND MAD AT ME I NEVER PROMISED THAT I WOULD WIN
SWISH HAD TO BE CARRIED ON HIS FATHER'S BACK SINCE IT WOULD HAVE TAKEN
MUD FROM SLUDGE POND HAS BEEN
MUD KNEW THAT THIS WOULD BE HIS CLOSEST RACE EVER AND HE WAS ACTUALLY GETTING A LITTLE BIT SCARED
GREAT GREAT GRAND TURTLE TAUGHT HIM
HE WAS THE SLOWEST TURTLE OF ALL TIME
A CLOSE RACE
IT SEEMS TO BE IN EVERYONE'S WAY TO SWISH
HE WAS UNBEATABLE
HELLO BET
SWISH WAS
STARTED TO PULL AHEAD OF MUD
THE LESS A TURTLE MOVES THE BIGGER THEY GET AND
I WOULD LIKE TO PRESENT THE TURTLE CUP TO BLUE POND THE CROWD WENT WILD AGAIN
HE WAS TIRED FROM RACING AND THOUGHT THAT IT WOULD BE NICE TO JUST LISTEN TO MUD'S SWEET VOICE AND FALL ASLEEP
WE NEVER THOUGHT OF THAT THEY ALL SAID THE TOWN AGREED TO TREAT SWISH LIKE A NORMAL TURTLE
SHELL WAXING
SURE THAT NO ONE
IT WOULD TAKE SOME TURTLES FROM FAR AWAY VILLAGES TWO WHOLE WEEKS JUST TO GET THERE
THEN HE SNAPPED OUT OF IT AND REMEMBERED HIS FATHER HAD WARNED HIM OF H THIS TRICK
YOU'RE JUST TRYING TO MAKE ME QUIT
THE LONGER THEY LIVE
SHE SAID
SAID SWISH'S MOTHER YOU'LL GET TO MEET ALL SORTS OF NEW TURTLES
WHO IS THIS YOUNG PUNK HE THOUGHT TO HIMSELF
THOUGH HE KNEW
SEVEN
AS THEY
HI SWISHY DO YOU WANT SOME YUMMY PIE TO FILL YOU UP AND SLOW
SO IT TOOK SOME TIME BEFORE ANYONE COULD FIGURE OUT WHICH TURTLES WERE THE MOST SLOWEST AFTER A FEW HOURS
CAN
THIS WAS SWISH'S
AND HE WAS ONLY A FOOT AWAY
BY NOW ALL THE TURTLES WERE USUALLY WAY AHEAD OF MUD
THERE WAS THE MOST FAMOUS TURTLE
ALL
SWISH WAS SAD THAT HE LOST BUT AL ALL THE TURTLES FROM BLUE POND CHEERED
HOW COME THEY DON'T MOVE THAT BIG ROCK
HEY THERE SWISH DO YOU WANT
AND HE WAS THE GREATEST
SO ONE DAY HE TOLD HIS PARENTS I DON'T WANT TO RACE ALL THE TURTLES IN BLUE POND HELD A MEETING TO DISCUSS THE PROBLEM
SLOWER WITH AGE
BUT THEN RIGHT AT THE END RIGHT BEFORE THE SUNSET
EVERYTHING ABOUT THE FESTIVAL WAS FUN
SAID SWISH'S FATHER
SWISH STARTED YAWNING
BUT THOUGH
WOULD NEVER DO ANYTHING FOR FREE
SOFTBELLY OF BLUE POND THE CROWD WENT WILD
YOU'VE DONE IT SLUDGE POND WINS
BREAKFAST THE NEXT MORNING
MUD HAD ACTUALLY SUNG HIMSELF TO SLEEP
LOOK THERE'S YOUR COUSIN
H HE'S STILL VERY YOUNG
YOU AREN'T RUNNING AS FAST AS YOU CAN
BLUE POND WAS A NICE VILLAGE LOCATED ABOUT THREE DAYS CRAWL FROM GREAT POND
EVERY FOUR YEARS TURTLES FROM ALL OVER THE LAND WOULD CRAWL TO GREAT POND
ALL THE SLOWEST OF THE SLOW
BE GOING FAST BUT GO SLOW INSTEAD
FINALLY AFTER THE LONG JOURNEY ALL THE TURTLES ARRIVED
THERE WAS WERE MANY
TORT POSTED THE RULES OF THE RACE ON A TREE FOR EVERYONE TO SEE
THE MAYOR OF PONDLAND WENT TO PRESENT
SWISH MADE A LOUD GULP SOUND
WAS IN HIS PRIME THERE WAS A NEW TURTLE BORN IN BLUE POND FOR THE TURTLE WAS NAMED SWISH WHEN SWISH WAS BORN
TO ALL THE TURTLES AT THE FESTIVAL THE CROWD STARTED YELLING SPEECH SPEECH
EXCEPT FOR MUD OF COURSE
AND HE THOUGHT IT WAS THE MOST WONDERFUL THING
HE WOULD TAKE IT MANY MORE TIMES AFTER THAT
I KNOW IT
RULE NUMBER ONE
AND THAT HE TREATED EVERYBODY LIKE HE WANTED TO BE TREATED LIKE A TURTLE WITH HONOR
DREW NEAR ALL THE TURTLES IN THE LAND
ALL THE EXTRA ATTENTION MADE SWISH VERY UNCOMFORTABLE HE THOUGHT SURE
ORT FOR WENT UP TO SWISH AND GAVE HIM THE TURTLE CUP SHE SAID SWISH YOU ARE THE YOUNGEST WINNER OF THE GREAT TURTLE
DROUGHT DWELLERS
HE PUT THE EARPLUGS ON HIS EARS AND COULDN'T HEAR MUD'S SINGING ANYMORE MUD KEPT SINGING HIS LULLABY FOR A FEW HOURS BUT HE STOPPED RIGHT BEFORE SUNSET
TURTLES NEVER CHEAT AND I'M A TURTLE WITH HONOR
IT WAS BECAUSE OF SWISH THAT
RACE IS A GOOD HONOR
YOU KNOW WHAT I'M GOING TO WIN THIS RACE
I KNOW THAT YOU CAN WIN SWISH BUT IT'S AN HONOR JUST TO GET
MAYBE HE COULD BRING BACK THE TURTLE CUP TO THEIR POND
THEN HE HEARD
AS YOU CAN BE SO SLOW EVEN I WAS

HE DOESN'T WANT TO BE TREATED SPECIAL
THE GREAT TURTLE RACE

YOU GO HIGHER
S
THAN

THE PLANE WAS IN A
MOUNTAIN
I GUESS
AND WE
THEY HAD TO COVER THEIR EARS FROM THE HORRIBLE SOUND THE FLIES
A GREAT BIG PARADE IN FRANKSVILLE TO CELEBRATE THE FACT THAT FOR ONCE THERE WAS NO WATER PROBLEM NO FLY PR PROBLEM NO FLUTE
THINGS WERE GOING GOOD FOR FRANKSVILLE
INTO CAR ACCIDENTS AND EVERYBODY LOOKED REALLY SILLY AT DANCES DANCING TO THE MUSIC THEY COULDN'T HEAR
MADE THIS FLUTE SOUND AWFUL
WHAT THEY COULDN'T KEEP JOHN IN JAIL SINCE HE WAS REALLY S SINCE HE WASN'T REALLY BREAKING ANY LAWS SO
THEN PRETTY SOON TONS OF FLIES WERE LANDING ON EVERYONE BEFORE THEY KNEW IT THE TOWN WAS FILLED WITH FLIES AGAIN OH NO THE CHIEF SANDERS IT'S JUST WHEN
AS BAD AS THE FLUTE SOUNDED IT WAS A LOT BETTER THAN A THOUSAND OF FLIES CRAWLING ON THEM
MAYBE A POORLY PLAYED FLUTE DOESN'T SOUND THAT BAD BUT IT JUST
JOHN DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TO DO SO JUST KEPT ON PLAYING HIS FLUTE THE FLIES WERE ANNOYING SO IT WOULD SWAT THEM
AND BIG BAND
WHEN THIS GUY PLAYED IT I'M SERIOUS STILL IT'S NOT AS BAD AS MILLIONS OF FLIES I SUPPOSE
THE NEIGHBORS ARE COMPLAINING AND THE CATS AND DOGS ARE TRYING TO CHEW OFF THEIR EARS BUT I HAVE TO PLAY
THEIR PROBLEMS WERE STARTED WHEN THEY RAN OUT OF WATER THANKFULLY SOMEONE WAS DIGGING A HOLE AND FOUND WATER
THEY ALL HAD SUCH NICE TEETH SO
BUT
WHAT UP WITH AN IDEA HE THOUGHT THAT IF HE MADE A NEW MOUTHPIECE ESPECIALLY SHAPED FOR
SHOULD I PRESS END
I WAS BORN TO DO IT I DON'T KNOW WHY BUT I FEEL LIKE I HAVE TO OR ELSE BAD THINGS WILL HAPPEN
AS BACK UP
DR WONG AND JOHN WERE THE STARS OF THE PARADE
THE POLICE CHIEF
BEFORE ROOS BEFORE I TELL YOU HOW ROOSTER JOHN
AND NO ONE HAD CAVITIES SO THERE WAS A PROBLEM IN THE LITTLE TOWN OF FRANKSVILLE WHAT SHOULD THEY DO THEY COULDN'T KEEP JOHN IN JAIL
THAT WAS AN OK IDEA BUT THERE WAS AN ECHO IN THE WELL THAT MADE HIS FLUTE SOUND LOUDER WINDOWS WERE BREAKING AND ALL THE COWS IN TOWN STARTED TO MAKE SOUR MILK
LIKE A ROOSTER AND PLAYED
AND THEN MULTIPLY
AND ACCIDENTALLY SMASHED IT INTO PIECES HE WAS VERY UPSET AT FIRST THEN HE SAID OH WELL GOOD THING I BROUGHT MY OLD
AND DOWN MAIN STREET EVERYONE CHEERED SUDDENLY A FLY LANDED ON A LITTLE GIRL THEN A FLY LANDED ON SOMEONE ELSE
F
FLEAS
DIDN'T WORK NO ONE COULD HEAR
AND THE CLARINET HOW HOWEVER FOR SOME REASON
I
FOLK
WOULD LAND ALL OVER THE PEOPLE AND THEY COULDN'T SWAT THEM OFF IT WAS GROSS SUDDENLY THE FLIES FLEW AWAY AS FAST AS THEY COULD DR WONG FOR THE SECOND PRONOUNCED
PROBLEM
THEY JUST COULDN'T LEAD A NORMAL LIFE THEN THEY DECIDED TO LOWER HIM DOWN
WE CAN'T LET YOU PLAY THE FLUTE ANYMORE JOHN
THERE WAS NOTHING THE POLICE COULD DO BESIDES EVERYBODY LOVED JOHN SINCE HE HAD BECOME THE TOWN DENTIST EVERYBODY'S TEETH WERE MUCH WHITER AND CLEANER
A WELL AND LET HIM PLAY DOWN WHERE NO ONE COULD HEAR HIM JOHN THOUGHT
FROM THEN ON JOHN WOULD WAKE UP AT SUNRISE
IT'S THE FLUTE SOUND THE FLIES HATE JOHN'S FLUTE PLAYING AS MUCH AS WE DO JOHN IS THE DENTIST IS DRIVING THE FLIES AWAY
WITH HIS HAND OR EVEN HIS NEW FLUTE HE STARTED SHAKING THE FLUTE TO GET HIS FLIES
JUST TRY TO IMAGINE SOMEONE SCRATCHING A CHALKBOARD WITH A FORK
A BIG BAND PLAYED AS THEY MARCHED UP AND
BUT SOON AFTER THEY STARTED TO GET FLY
SO THEY DECIDED THAT JOHN COULD PLAY THE FLUTE AND EVERYBODY ELSE WOULD HAVE TO WEAR EARPLUGS WELL I'M SURE YOU GUESSED THAT
HIS REAL LOVE WAS MUSIC HE PLAYED MANY MUSICAL INSTRUMENTS SUCH AS THE GUITAR THE TUBA THE PIANO
JOHN'S MOUTH THEN PERHAPS HE COULD PLAY THE FLUTE NORMALLY
LOOK JOHN I'VE HEARD YOU PLAY THE CLARINET YOU'RE QUITE GOOD WHY DON'T YOU PLAY THAT INSTEAD SAID CHIEF SANDERS OH THAT'S A NICE INSTRUMENT BUT IT'S NOT THE FLUTE
THEY WERE UP ON THE MAIN FLOAT
THAT'S HOW THE FLUTE SOUNDED
CHIEF SANDERS
GOT HIS NAME YOU SHOULD KNOW A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE TOWN OF FRANKSVILLE FRANKSVILLE WAS A TOWN THAT SEEMED TO HAVE NO PROBLEM AFTER THE OTHER
AND THEY DIDN'T WANT TO KICK HIM OUT OF TOWN BECAUSE
THE BAD FLUTE PLAYER WAS ROOSTER JOHN HE WASN'T CALLED ROOSTER JOHN YET THAT CAME LATER HE WAS THE NEW TOWN DENTIST HE WAS AN EXCELLENT DENTIST
THE LOCAL SCIENTIST DR WONG CAME
AND PLAY TO KEEP THE FLIES AWAY
FLUTE
THAT TIMES A HUNDRED
THEN SOMEONE LANDED ON SOME LANDED ON A BUNCH OF PEOPLE
IT WAS THEN THAT THE PEOPLE OF FRANKSVILLE REALIZED THEY WOULD HAVE TO TAKE THE GOOD WITH THE BAD BECAUSE
FLIES THEY GOT TONS AND TONS OF FLIES THEN THE FLIES STOPPED BUT JUST THEN A MAN MOVED TO TOWN WHO PLAYED THE FLUTE SO BADLY THAT PEOPLE WOULD RUN AWAY SCREAMING
ANYTHING PEOPLE WERE GETTING IN
THIS WAY HIS MOUTH WAS SHAPED
EVEN WROTE YOU A SONG CHIEF SANDERS IT'S CALLED COPS AND ROBBERS THEN HE PLAYED THE SONG THE POLICE CHIEF HATED THE SOUND SO MUCH THAT HE THREW JOHN IN JAIL
AND GUESS WHAT IT WORKED DR WONG WAS THE TOWN HERO THE FLUTE SOUNDED NORMAL AND IT TURNED OUT JOHN COULD PLAY IT QUITE WELL PEOPLE IN THE TOWN DECIDED TO HAVE A BIG
HEARD THE NOISE THEY COULDN'T EVEN SWAT THE FLIES ANYMORE

THIS IS JUST TYPE OF
EUROPE IN ORDER TO IMPROVE TRADE
MAN THAT IS GREAT
HIS MAIN OBJECTION WAS THE TO BEING EATEN
ONE MORE THING SIR
ATTEND
IT IS INTERESTING TO POINT
AND HER BEST FRIEND MAGGIE
THAT I FEAR ONLY YOU CAN ANSWER SHE SAID
OF THIS NONSENSE SAID YIN YIN'S MOTHER POO POO
AUTOMATICALLY FALLS IN LOVE WITH THEM
BUT EVERYTHING
ALL
BIRDS
WAS VERY PROUD OF HER DAUGHTER
REPLIED TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND AND SEVENTY SIX
SAID
IN
THE RAW MEAT HE HAD TO FEED TO THE TIGERS HIS MAIN
THINGS
DESPITE
SO IT S
BUT HE WAS SUPPORTIVE OF HIS YOUNG DAUGHTER AND SHOWED
MANY PEOPLE KNOW THAT PANDAS EAT BAMBOO
TO THE MOON
AN INSTANT LATER
OB
IF YOU MUST GO IT BE BEST TO FLY NONSENSE SAID
THERE WERE THREE PANDAS AND THEY WERE KNOWN AS THE PANDA PAN FAMILY
SAID YIN YIN
SAID MAGGIE YES BUT HOW MANY MORE
THE WHAT
UNCOMFORTABLE
I KNOW I SHOULDN'T BE TELLING YOU THIS BUT WE MIGHT HAVE
THE ZOO MANAGER
HOME
OH WELL THAT MAKES SENSE THEN
JUST THAT THERE HASN'T HAVEN'T
ONCE YOU GET OVER ONE THOUSAND MAGPIE TOGETHER THEY TEND
HER FATHER
AND MAKE HER WANT
IF HER
HE DID MANAGE TO SAY I BELIEVE ROLLING
AT LEAST
SO FOR FRED WHEN IT CAME TO PANDAS HE HAD A WARM SPOT ON HIS HEART ACTUALLY IT WAS
AND I'VE IT BEEN
THAT ZOO
CONSIDERATION THAT ONCE YOU GET OVER A THOUSAND MAGPIE TOGETHER THEY CAN TEND TO FLY FLIGHT AND CAN'T AGREE ON
ANNIVERSARY
WITHOUT GETTING A TERRIBLE PAIN IN YOUR NECK SAID OWL
AND
GOING TO THE MOON INDEED NONSENSE YOUR JOB IS TO BE CUTE
BUT YIN YIN THE YOUNG PANDA
OH YIN YIN I WISH
RE RENAMED
LIKE WHAT HE WAS SUPPOSED TO
TREE QUICKLY SAID
SHE COULD BE A VERY
TO MOVE FROM THEIR WONDERFUL HOME BUT LATER
SUCH NONSENSE GOING TO THE MOON SAID HER MOTHER POO POO
SO MAGGIE FLEW
IF
IT TURNS OUT THAT OWL DIDN'T TAKE
THAT IS
HUG
THEY WERE TALKING ABOUT SINCE THEY HADN'T THOUGHT
MANY LITTLE BOY'S CHEEKS HAVE BEEN OF RAW
AND WAS IN TERRIFIC SHAPE
I SEE YOU WINGS FLAPPING
WHEN FRED WALKED INTO
WOULD LOOK
THIS CAN ALMOST BE CERTAINLY
TO LOOK AT THAT LADY OVER THERE
FIGURED THAT
BACK AT THE PANDA'S HOME
THE FATHER WATCHING THIS ALL THROUGH ONE EYE
SO PEOPLE WON'T RUN TO THE GIFT SHOP AND BUY AND BEAR DOLLS IT'S SIMPLE ECONOMICS
HUMAN BEINGS
YOU
ME SIR THAT YIN YIN WANTED TO BE A GREAT EXPLORER
WELL SIR WHEN COLUMBUS SET
NOW IF YOU EXCUSE ME I NEED TO SQUEEZE SOMETHING BEFORE I SCREAM
COULD BE PURCHASED
AND THOSE MAGPIES STARTED FLUTTERING
YIN YIN W WAS ALWAYS ONE
DIDN'T THINK IT WAS VERY PROPER
BUT INSTEAD BECAME A GREAT EXPLORER
NO WAIT A SECOND
PIES FLYING AROUND
AND ROLL TWO DAYS
MAGPIE
WHAT A ZOO NEEDS IS A GREAT
THAT MORE STUFFED PANDA BEARS
THAT
ALL
IS THIS FA FOR A YOUNG
IT'S TAKEN ME A COUPLE OF WEEKS TO FIGURE IT OUT
SHE WAS VERY PROUD
AND HUGS AT THE ZOO
GOING TO THE MOON
WHY HE
A WEEK LATER MAGGIE MANAGED
IF IT WEREN'T FOR YIN YIN THEY WOULD
WHICH YOUNG LADY HELP
BE MY BEST TO ASK THE OWL
THEY WERE STILL TRYING TO GET OUT GET
COULD
IN S SAN ANGELES
THE MAGPIE ABOUT GOING TO THE MOON
BE DANGEROUS SO ALL OF THE PEOPLE AT THE ZOO WOULD KNOW THE PANDAS HAD BEEN
IN ITSELF WILL NOT
BEFORE HE FELL
QUITE HEAVY SO BECAUSE
THEY SAID TOGETHER PULLING
I'M SORRY
WHO LOOKED A LOT LIKE
IT TURNS OUT WAS GETTING THE ROCKET SHIP
I'M SO MAD I'M
MOO MAN
FURTHER DISTANCES PANDAS HAVE A STRANGE
BE
TO THE HUG OF
BESIDES IF YOU LEAVE
I
AND SAID WHAT IS GOING ON WITH YOUR PANDAS FRED I'VE NEVER SEEN ANYTHING LIKE IT
I THINK
DID YOU KNOW THAT SINCE THE LITTLE PANDA BUILT
WHERE
AND PANDAS TEND TO HANDLE I BAMBOO
HER SON CHEEKS
MAGPIE FRIENDS WERE TO THE EACH GRAB HOLD OF CORNER
BUT THE POINT IS THAT
DECENTLY ROUND
SURE WAS IMPRESSED THOUGH
VERY GOOD AT IT
HMM HEAVIER THAN I THOUGHT
FRED WAS STARTING TO FEEL
NOW WHILE ALL
HOW MANY MAGPIES WOULD BE NEEDING TO FLY A FOUR HUNDRED POUND PANDA BEAR AND ONE HUNDRED POUND BAMBOO ROCKET SHIP TO THE MOON
LISTENING TO FRED
WOULD COME
YOU HAD TO LEAVE US AFTER ALL
HAD FED THE PANDAS
T
CONSIDERATION
IT'S NOT THAT YOU AREN'T SELLING ENOUGH STUFFED PANDA BEARS
THE RATHER UN CUDDLY PALM TREES
YIN YIN
FOR HIS ADVICE
OF MUCH ELSE SINCE YIN YIN SAID I WANT TO GO THERE AND POINTED TO THE MOON
UNDER
PHYSICAL FITNESS WAS NOT THE ONLY REASON THAT FRED LOVED PANDAS THE OTHER REASON WAS THAT ANYONE WHO GETS WITHIN
BY STAIN
WERE BIRDS
IT WA
SAID MAGGIE
ONE EYE
WE ARE SPOKES
FRED FED THE PANDA BEARS AND THE TIGERS AND THE TURTLES THE TURLES WEREN'T SO BAD BUT AS FOR THE TIGERS HE WASN'T SO SURE
MAKES
YIN YIN
A BUSINESS WOMAN
ON HIS SHIP
PROFITS HAVE GONE UP JUST FOUR THOUSAND
EXPOSURE WE NEEDED
THE YOUNG

THE PANDA
SHE COULD THINK WAS TO SAY NONSENSE AS FOR YIN YIN
IT'S A LAW OF NATURE

EVENTUALLY FLEABAG GOT TO TAKE THE COLLAR OFF BUT
OLD
HE SPRINTED TO HIS OWNERS AND GAVE
ONE DAY FLEABAG WENT TO A VET FLEABAG DIDN'T MIND THE VET BECAUSE USUALLY THE PEOPLE
HIS OWNERS NAME
TO BE ON HIS LEASH AT THE DOG PARK

CHRIS
MAN LEFT
SHE SAID SPITEFULLY
WHAT THE ZOO NEEDS IS A GREAT EVERYTHING
WHEN SHE WANTED
ACTUALLY IT WAS A EIGHTY FIVE DEGREES
NOW IF YOU EXCUSE ME I NEED
I HAVE A QUESTION THAT I FEAR
IT'LL IT'LL TAKE
MANY A LITTLE BOY'S CHEEKS
QUICKLY HE SAID IT COSTS SO MUCH TO
TIMES SAID
TO
IN SA IN ANGELES
TO SLEEP HE DID
AND BUY PANDA BEAR DOLLS
AT FURTHER DISTANCE PANDAS HAVE A STRANGE ALMOST MAGICAL EFFECT ON HUMAN
WE NEEDED
THE MAIN OBSTACLE IT'S TURNS OUT
MAGPIE WHO LOOKED A LOT LIKE A PANDA IF
A LOT OF BAMBOO CAN GET QUITE HEAVY SO BECAUSE OF THE PANDAS FRED BECAME VERY STRONG
DID YOU KNOW THAT SINCE THE LITTLE PANDA BUILT
BAMBOO IS A VERY WORKABLE SUBSTANCE AND PANDAS
GOING TO THE MOON SAID HER MOTHER POO POO
ROCKET SHIP
THOUGH
SHE WAS VERY PROUD TO
WAS VERY PROUD OF HER DAUGHTER
WHAT IS GOING ON WITH YOUR PANDAS FRED
UH ACTUALLY IT WAS A EIGHTY FIVE
I SEE FRED
THE
NO WAIT
THE
BUT EVERYTHING WAS NOT ALL BAMBOO
IT'S A LAW OF NATURE
JUST THE TYPE OF EXPOSURE
THIS CAN CERTAINLY BE ACCOUNTED FOR
HE
YES BUT HOW MANY MORE
AND CAN'T AGREE ON A SINGLE THING
OUCH MOM CUT THAT OUT
BUT LATER WHEN FRED WALKED INTO THE PANDA'S HOME UNDER A HIS
NO HOW MANY MAGPIE
THE ZOO MANAGER
WO
OR TAKE TWO
MUST GO IT WILL BE BEST TO FLY
THE PALM TREE
SPOKESPEOPLE
WITH THE PANDAS MAN SAID THE ZOO KEEPER MANAGER
FRED

FIGURED THAT IF
THAT
REASON THAT FRED LOVED THE PANDAS

WHEN COLUMBUS SET OUT
ARE SO OLD AT ZOO GIFT SHOP
I SEE YOUR WING FLAPPING BUT WE DON'T SEEM TO BE GOING ANYWHERE SAID YIN YIN
THE ROCKET IN THE AIR IT TURNS OUT
THAT'S ENOUGH OF THIS NONSENSE SAID YIN YIN'S MOTHER POO POO
YES THE BIG ONE IN THE SKY THAT IS MOSTLY
MAGGIE NEVER STOPPED TRYING TO GET TO THE MOON
FOR THE PANDA STUFFED
HAD TO MOVE FROM THEIR WONDERFUL HOME
HER MOTHER AND FATHER KNEW I
TO HUG THE PANDA
SAID FRED
THE FATHER WATCHING THIS ALL THROUGH ONE EYE
AND THEY WERE KNOWN AS THE PAN FAMILY
IT WAS VERY PROPER FOR A WISE YOUNG PANDA BEAR TO GO ROLLING OFF TO PLACES
I WISH THAT MORE PEOPLE WOULD COME TO VISIT THE ZOO
IT'S ONLY HOME YOU KNOW BESIDES
BUT I JUST LEARNED HOW TO MAKE HOW TO MAKE MYSELF INTO A BALL AND ROLL IN TWO DAYS
HE DIDN'T MIND HANDLING WITH THE RAW MEAT HE HAD TO FEED THE TI TO THE TIGERS HIS MAIN OBJECTION WAS TO BEING EATEN NO ONE COULD BLAME FRED REALLY SINCE NO ONE REALLY WANTS TO BE EATEN SOME
NONSENSE SAID THE MOTHER
IT'S JUST THAT WE'RE
LATER A YOUNG BOY WAS
FRED WAS STARTING TO FEEL
BUT YIN YIN PANDA WAS NOT LISTENING TO FRED
YIN YIN'S FATHER MOO MAN
HOW TO TURN YOUR HEAD ALL THE WAY AROUND WITHOUT GETTING A TERRIBLE PAIN IN YOUR NECK
MADE RAW
I WOULD HATE
SAID
I BELIEVE ROLLING IS A DECIDEDLY ROUND ABOUT WAY TO GO
THE OWL INSTANTLY
WE ARE
INSTEAD BECAME A GREAT EXPLORER
GETTING THE ROCKET SHIP OFF THE GROUND
FRED WAS NOT ALLOWED TO ACTUALLY HUG THE PANDA BEARS SINCE THAT
WILL BE WITH
PANDAS WERE BIRDS
WAS NOT THAT
BUT PHYSICAL FITNESS WAS NOT
AND THOSE MAGPIES SAID STARTED FLUTTERING ABOUT
ONE TWO THREE TO THE MOON
IT IS INTERESTING TO POINT OUT AT THIS
WELL SIR
A WEEK LATER DESPITE MUCH FLAPPING THEY WERE STILL TRYING
YIN YIN SAID I WANT TO GO THERE AND POINTED TO THE MOON
RENAMED AFTER A FAMOUS EXPLORER
MAGGIE THE MAGPIE ABOUT GOING
IF IT WEREN'T FOR YIN YIN
WERE DISCUSSING
IT'S TAKEN ME A COUPLE WEEKS TO FIGURE OUT IT OUT BUT
THE UNCONTROLLABLE
FIVE DEGREES ON HIS LEFT KIDNEY BUT THE POINT IS THAT HE WAS VERY FOND OF FEEDING THE PANDA'S
DO YOU THINK THAT ZOO COULD PURCHASE ME A LARGE
ONE MORNING FRED WAS FEEDING YIN YIN AND SAID
BUT I JUST LEARNED
FRED FRED
A BUSINESS MAN BUT
DO YOU SUPPOSED WHAT FRED WAS DOING
IT'S NOT THAT YOU'RE
THINK TO SAY WAS NONSENSE
A FOUR HUNDRED POUND PANDA BEAR
FOR FRED THE NEXT DAY
A WEEK LATER MAGGIE MANAGED TO ROUND UP TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND AND SEVENTY EIGHT MAGPIE
MANAGER CAME UP TO HIM AND SAID
AND INSTEAD
WERE TO EACH GRAB HOLD OF A CORNER
I THINK WE SHOULD RENAME YIN YIN COLUMBUS
KNOW THAT THE PANDAS
THE MAIN OBSTACLE
HAVE GONE UP FOUR THOUSAND PERCENT
ANYONE
HEAVIER
EUROPE IN ORDER TO IM
OF THE OTHER STUFF ANIMALS COMBINED
THAT ONCE YOU EVER GET A THOUSAND MAGPIE
NONSENSE YOUR JOB IS TO BE CUTE SO PEOPLE WANT TO
AND MOST CERTAINLY NOT MADE OF BAMBOO
YIN YIN WAS ALWAYS ONE TO TAKE GOOD ADVICE FROM HER FATHER
WHICH YOUNG LADY HELPS FOR PAY FOR THE BAMBOO
HADN'T TALKED
BEFORE HE RAN OFF TO HUG THE PALM
MADE
HAD AT LEAST ONE
WERE
BUT WE M
AND SHOWED HIS SUPPORT BY TAKING A NAP
AND A ONE HUNDRED
LEAVE
AGO AND I'M BECOMING VERY GOOD AT IT
SO MAGGIE FLEW TO THE OWL AND
DO LIKE TO BITE THEIR FINGER NAILS BUT FRED WASN'T A NAIL BITER SO BEING EATEN WAS DEFINITELY NOT SOMETHING HE LOOKED FORWARD TO EACH AFTERNOON AT THREE O'CLOCK WHEN IT WAS TIME TO FEED THE TIGERS
COMING
HER SON
AN INSTANT
COMPANION
I DON'T THINK IT WILL TAKE THAT LONG TO ROLL THERE SAID YIN YIN
ONLY YOU CAN ANSWER SHE SAID
TO SQUEEZE SOMETHING BEFORE I SCREAM
UH
HAVE BEEN
FEED YOU PANDA BEARS
DID MANAGE TO SAY
IF WE DON'T GET MORE MONEY
TO THE MOON SAID MAGGIE
IT'S SIMPLE ECONOMICS LIKE IT OR NOT
A LOT LIKE A PANDA WOULD LOOK IF
BEINGS WHICH MAKES US WANT TO HUG AND SQUEEZE THINGS
THOSE PANDA'S
IT THE MAIN OBSTACLE IT TURNS OUT WAS
WAS IN TERRIFIC SHAPE
THAT BAMBOO ROCKET SHIP
TEND TO HANDLE BAMBOO A LOT SO THIS ITSELF
THEY HADN'T THOUGHT OR TALKED OF MUCH ELSE SINCE
THE PANDA'S ROOM
I DON'T UNDERSTAND
THEY COULD ALL FLY TO THE MOON SO THEY TRIED
SHE WAS TALKING TO HER BEST FRIEND
BE
AFTER ALL
N
ONE MORE THING SIR ABOUT THOSE MAGPIES FLYING ABOVE THE PANDAS
I'VE NEVER SEEN ANYTHING LIKE IT
AND HUGS AT THE ZOO
RATHER UN CUDDLY PALM TREE OUTSIDE OF
NO WAIT A SECOND
NOW WHILE THIS WAS GOING ON DO YOU SUPPOSE
THAT
BY THIS STRANGE ALMOST MAGICAL EFFECT THAT THE PANDA POSSESS
NAME COLUMBUS IT WAS FRED'S IDEA SO LET'S BEGIN WITH FRED
WANTED A BUSI TO BE
YIN YIN SAID I'M NOT SURE EXACTLY REPLIED MAGGIE
I'M SORRY TO SAY BUT
NEW YELLOW UMBRELLA ALL SHE COULD
WOULD BE NEEDED TO FLY
LAUGHED AND WALKED AWAY BUT DID PURCHASE A FASHIONABLE YELLOW UMBRELLA
T'WOULD WOULD BE BEST
GIVE OR TAKE TWO
WELL IT SEEMS TO ME SIR THAT YIN YIN WANTED BE GREAT EXPLORER
THE ZOO
THOUGHT ABOUT IT AND SAID YOU KNOW
ALL THE OTHER PEOPLE AT THE ZOO WOULD
HER AND THREE OF HER STRONGEST MAGPIE FRIENDS
ZOO'S PROFITS
THE OTHER REASON WAS THAT
I KNOW
THAT THE OWL DIDN'T TAKE CONSIDERATION
ON HIS SHIP HE WAS REALLY TRYING TO FIND A QUICKER WAY TO GET AROUND
THEN ALL
HMM
WHAT SORT OF NONSENSE IS THIS FOR YOUNG PANDA BEAR GOING TO THE MOON INDEED
NO
NOT MOSTLY LIKELY NOT MADE OF CHEESE
ANIMAL INDUSTRY
KNEW WHAT THEY WERE TALKING ABOUT SINCE THEY HADN'T
FOR HE ALWAYS
THEY
SO
BUT MANY A LITTLE BOY'S CHEEKS HAVE BEEN
I KNOW I SHOULDN'T BE TELLING YOU THIS
BUT WHERE THERE WASN'T ANY BAMBOO BUT HE WAS SUPPORTIVE OF HIS YOUNG DAUGHTER
ROLL TWO DAYS
TO ASK THE OWL THEN CLOSED HIS EYE
IF YOU
IT'S JUST THAT THERE HASN'T BEEN ENOUGH
I'M SO MAD I'M GOING TO LOOK AT THAT LADY OVER THERE AND MAKE HER WANT TO SQUEEZE
PEOPLE
HEARD SAYING
SAID OWL
DIDN'T
THE ZOO MANAGER
T'WOULDN'T
MADE RAW WHEN MOTHER POO POO PANDA WAS UPSET
IF YOU HAD TO LEAVE US
REPLIED TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND AND SEVENTY SIX
IF YOU
YES BUT WHAT DOES THAT HAVE TO DO
SPOKE
AFTER FRED HAD FED THE PANDAS AND WAS HUGGING
MAGGIE
COULD BE DANGEROUS
US FOR A LONG TIME
ASTONISHING AT LEAST
ONLY
THAT
THAT'S
TO GET
THEY SAID TOGETHER PULLING WITH ALL THEIR MIGHT
TIME THAT MORE STUFFED PANDA BEARS
WELL SIR
ANOTHER THAT'S ENOUGH OF THIS
AND SHE AND
TO THE MOON
THEY WOULD THEY WOULD HAVE
WERE DISCUSSING ABOUT GOING TO THE MOON
SIZED UMBRELLA
THERE WERE THREE PANDA'S
I THINK YIN YIN WANTS TO GO TO THE MOON AND MAGPIES WANT TO TAKE HER THERE
URGE
DIDN'T THINK
OH YIN YIN
HOW TO
AFTER ALL
LIKE HE WAS FEEDING THE PANDAS LIKE HE WAS SUPPOSED TO SO ONE DAY
YOU AREN'T SELLING ENOUGH STUFFED PANDA BEARS
FRED FED THE PANDA BEARS AND TIGERS AND TURTLES THE TURTLES WEREN'T SO BAD BUT AS FOR THE TIGERS HE WASN'T SO SURE
AS FOR YIN YIN SHE WAS VERY
BACK IN THE IN THE PANDA'S HOME THE MOTHER PANDA POO POO
SHE COULD BE
AND INSTEAD BECOME A BUSINESS WOMAN
FRED
OF
THE K THE ZOO KEEPER SAID GOOD HEAVENS MAN THAT IS A GREAT IDEA
HAD JUST BEEN HAD JUST BEEN FED WHEN THEY SAW FRED HUGGING
IT TURNS OUT
THIS IS
WHO GETS WITHIN THREE FEET OF A PANDA AUTOMATICALLY FALLS IN LOVE WITH THEM
TOGETHER THEY TEND TO FIGHT
THAN I THOUGHT I THINK WE WILL NEED MORE MAGPIES SAID MAGGIE
TRADE
WHY DID A PANDA WITH THE BEAUTIFUL GIRL NAME YIN YIN HAVE HER NAME CHANGED TO
THIS
RUN TO THE GIFT SHOP
YIN YIN AND HER BEST FRIEND MAGGIE
WAS
AND LESS THAN A WEEK LATER YIN YIN AND MAGGIE HAD BUILT A ROCKET SHIP OUT OF BAMBOO

THAT WE SAW ON T V ON THE ANIMAL CHANNEL I KNEW OUR CAT WOULD GROW HER FUR BACK
BLAZING IN THE FIRE TILL AS I GAZE WITH STARRY EYES THE ARMIES FADE
HAVE YOU GOT GOOD GRADES TO KNOW IF YOU SHOULD TEACH A CAT
TH
GERBILS GERBILS AND
OP
AN THEN ONCE AGAIN THE GLOW RETURNS AGAIN
SHE'S
GROUNDED ME AND TOLD ME TO WRITE DOWN WHY I AM SORRY BEFORE I WAS ALONE OUT OF MY ROOM I AM
I WAS AFRAID TO TELL YOU THE REALLY REASON I SHA SHAVED THE CAT WAS THAT I WENT WANT TO BE A BARBER AND I NEEDED
SO IT WAS REALLY MY FATHER
NOT MRS CASPER
SO GOOD AT SCHOOL AND YOU BOUGHT HER A CAT
I DO EACH TIME AND SOON SHE WOULD HAVE AN INVISIBLE COAT OF CAT FUR ARMOR
PRESSURE AND YOU KNOW WHAT THESE STUPID GERBILS DIDN'T EVEN THANK ME
TALK
ACTUALLY
THE LAMPS NOW ENTER DOWN THE STREET
BUT HER HAIRLESS CAT AND THEY NEED FUR IN
GETTING ALL HOT AND UNCOMFORTABLE AND STUFF
OVERHEAT IN WINTER
THE
WAS THAT HE'S ALWAYS SNEEZING AROUND IT
A CAT AND I GET A STUPID TURTLE ANYWAYS TURTLES DON'T DO ANYTHING EXCEPT POKE THEIR HEADS OUT AND BE NOT CUDDLY CAN I GET A DOG PLEASE SO IN CONCLUSION I'M GETTING HUNGRY AND I'M SORRY FOR SHAVING THE CAT
HAIR CLIPPERS AND SHAVED IT
ARMIES MARCHES GO
AND DID STUPID THINGS THAT'S THE LAST TIME
ARE VERY MEAN TO MAKE ME DO THIS BECAUSE IT WASN'T EVEN MY FAULT I COULDN'T HELP IT ANYWAY IT WAS AN ACCIDENT AND I
HOW COME JENNY'S GETS
HA
OH YEAH I FORGOT
COULD TAKE HER ON T V
SO
ANYWAY YOU WOULDN'T ALWAYS TAKE THE CAT'S SIDE IF YOU SIDE KNEW THE STUFF HE DIDN'T DID TO ME MY POOR TURTLE
IT LOOKS AND
BUT MY STUPID SISTER NEVER THOUGHT HER CAT HOW TO LISTEN SO
EVEN SLOWER FALLS ABOUT THE GARDEN TREES AND WALLS
INSTEAD
TO GUESS
THIS AND POOR KITTY
YOU USE
VALLEY LO
WON'T LIKE TO START BY SAYING THAT I THINK
THEN I DID ON THE CAT CAUSE NOW I HAVE
WENT WHEN
GIFT TO HIM SO I COULDN'T BUY HIM
BE A SUPER CAT
WHAT
THAT IT'S
AND TRYING TO ROLL ME OVER
ACCIDENT TURN ON THE NOSE HAIR CLIPPERS AND THE CAT WAS BEING CHASED BY THE TURTLE AND RAN RIGHT BY THE CLIPPERS AND SHAVED HERSELF I KEPT SAYING NO KITTY
ACES FOR HER BIG STUPID FACE
FEET AND THE BLUE
I MEAN IT'S BE SUMMER SOON ENOUGH AND I JUST WANT
WOULD
PLUS I FORGOT TO TELL YOU THAT
YOU WOULD HAVE A BETTER
HAVE BOUGHT HER A TURTLE
ON MY TOES OR SURE IT'S EASY TO SAY THAT I SHOULD HAVE JUST PICKED THE CAT UP AND BUT SOMETHING WE DON'T ALWAYS THINK ALL THAT GREAT UNDER
FURNACES FURNACES
A SHAVE THE CAT TO PROTECT ANY STUPID GERBILS
ARM
OK HERE'S WHAT HAPPENED AS I REMEMBER IT I SAW
YOU GAZE WILL JUST PROBABLY SAY IT'S WINTER
AND ST
AND SOMETHING EVEN DARKER
TONIGHT
LOTS OF MONEY SO THAT YOU CAN SEND JENNY TO COLLEGE
DID YOU KNOW THAT I WANT
BUT THE REAL REASON
ARMY ARMIES MARCH BY TOWER AND SPIRE
IF I HAD A CAT I WOULDN'T TEACH IT
THE CAT LIKES BEING
GOT REALLY HOT PLUS OSCAR MY TURTLE TOLD ME TO SHAVE THE CAT
THIS
THE DIES
TO SHAVE ITSELF
YOU TOLD US TO
THE PHANTOM CITY BURNS AND DOWN THE RED HOTS
OH
ON THE S
PRACTICE I WAS AFRAID YOU WOULDN'T LET ME PRACTICE ON MY OWN HEAD CAN I
MAD AT YOU ARE I
MY SCIENCE TEACHER SHE M MADE US SHAVE SOMETHING FOR SCIENCE ASK HER SHE SAID THAT
FATHER'S DAY
CAUSE SHE'S SO RESPONSIBLE AND STUFF
THEN SHE WOULD
BUT IF HE COULD HE SHE WOULD HAVE SAID PLEASE SHAVE THE CAT IT KEEPS HITTING ME ON THE SHELL
THEY JUST RAN AND
THE TRUTH IS THAT I BY
FAMILIES SOUND THE FALLING
THE WINTER SOMETIMES I THINK I SWEAR THAT'S THE REASON ALSO I WAS GOING TO SELL THE CAT FUR AND BUY MY SISTER JENNY S JENNY
BUT SO WHAT IF IT'S WINTER
PLUS IF YOU WERE ALWAYS CUDDLING WITH MY SISTER SO MUCH MAYBE SHE
I KNOW HOW MUCH YOU GET HIM ALWAYS SNEEZING AND STUFF SO I THOUGHT IF I GOT RID OF HIS FUR HE WOULDN'T SNEEZE AND THAT
ALL OH YOU CAN SEE THAT IT'S REALLY JENNY'S FAULT FOR NOT BEING AS RESPONSIBLE AS YOU ALWAYS SAY AND NOT BRUSHING HER TEETH P S IF YOU COULD
YOU SHOULDN'T BE PROUD OF ME FOR THINKING SO FAST
BLINDING AMBERS TELL ME TRUE WHERE ARE THESE ARMIES MARCHING TO AND WHAT THE BURNING CITY IS THAT CRUMBLES IN YOUR
I SH
DIDN'T EVEN DO IT ON PURPOSE I REALLY DIDN'T MEAN TO SHAVE THE CAT REALLY I SWEAR
EX
YOU THAT MOM AND DAD JENNY DIDN'T BRUSH HER TEETH LAST NIGHT I THINK THAT SHE SHOULD BRUSH HER TEETH TWICE
SHOWS AND GET
DREW I'LL GET YOU DIDN'T KNOW SOMETHING ELSE
FLICKERS ON THE BACK OF BOOKS
CAT'S AREN'T ALWAYS NICE JUST LIKE MY SISTER JENNY ISN'T ALWAYS NICE
SHE JUST IGNORED ME SHE SAYS NOT SO RESPONSIBLE AFTER ALL
THE CAT CAME INTO MY DAD AND BECAUSE JENNY NEVER PLAYS WITH IT ENOUGH
USING TO THE IDEAS BEFORE IT
DEAR MOM DON'T LET DAD KNOW THAT THE REAL REASON I SHAVED THE CAT
WE COULDN'T HIT ANIMALS SO I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT ELSE TO DO SO I GRABBED DAD'S NOSE
THE
WHEEL
THAT YOU
ANYTHING NICE SINCE YOU TOOK AWAY MY ALLOWANCE FOR WHEN I SHAVED THE NEIGHBOR'S DOG
HER SHAVE HAIR IT GREW BACK
WENT DAD CALLED LIFE
THAT SHE DIDN'T BRUSH HER TEETH
ON YOUR
OPINION
THE EMPTY ROOM THE WARMLY ON THE ROOF
YOUR FAULT REALLY DAD PLEASE DON'T READ THE NEXT PART
WHEN YOU LEAVE THE ROOM YOU GUESS NEVER LIKE OSCAR AS MUCH AS THE CAT
NO DON'T SHAVE YOURSELF
EVE
HAVE BEEN WITH HER CAT
THE CAT
SO I IT REALLY
YOU SHOULD BE BLAMING MRS
I COULDN'T HAVE SHAVED IT SINCERELY DANNY
A LOT OF A BUNCH OF TIMES HER HAIR WOULD GROW BACK
PR
BESIDE THE REAL REASON I SHAVED THE CAT WAS TO KEEP IT NICE AND COOL I JUST DIDN'T WANT TO SEE THE CAT
ARMIES IN THE FIRE
DANNY CATS DON'T
THAT THE CAT WAS TRYING TO GET
SO I THOUGHT THAT I IF I COULD SHAVE THE CAT
NOT THAT I SHAVED THE CAT
THAT'S JUST MY
EVEN IF SHE IS A DUMB LITTLE TATTLE TALE
SINCE DEAR MOM AND DAD PARENTS SINCE YOU HAVE
ED TO DO A BARB
OF CITY

SLOWLY NOW DON'T SEND WAVES TO THE WARN
MR DEGAS
HIS FRONT FRONT AND BACK LEGS
LOUISIANA

ASKED JUDY ANN
I'VE SEEN THE ALLIGATORS BEFORE BUT BUT NEVER THIS CLOSE BRYAN SAID
EASED TO HIMSELF TO GENT
DR THOMAS EXPLAINED
TOWARD DR THOMAS AND TRIED TO DIVE
SIZES
HE SMILED THROUGH THE CURLY BROWN AND GRAY BE
ALL ABOUT
I WOULD HAVE TO USE A TRAP
GROWN ALLIGATORS MAY EAT JUST ABOUT ANYTHING
ONLY ITS HEAD STILL SHOWED
GENTLY
SNAPS UP
NOW THAT'S A GOOD IDEA ANSWERED MR
THERE HE WAS ABLE TO SIT ON THE ALLIGATOR
THEY LIVED NEXT DOOR TO EACH A
DR THOMAS HAD CAPTURED THE ALLIGATOR
THEY WERE CROSSING THE BRIDGE OVER THE CREEK WHEN SUDDENLY BRYAN STOPPED
ON EACH END
THE LOOP CLOSED TIGHTLY AROUND ITS NECK
HE QUICKLY PULLED
AN INVADED OUR OUR NEIGHBORHOOD SAID BRYAN
DR THOMAS PULLED
IT'S WAITING FOR A LUNCH RIGHT NOW SAID BRYAN USUALLY DR THOMAS
GO GET MY DAD SAID BRYAN
THE ALLIGATOR
CLOSE DOWN ON ITS PREY
DEAL DIALED THE EMERGENCY NUMBER AND EXPLAINED
AT NIGHT JUDY ANN AND BRYAN COULD HEAR THE SOUNDS
BRYAN AND JUDY ANN BRYAN AND JUDY ANN LOOKED AT THE ALLIGATOR
SEE IT
I'LL SEE
THEIR BI
EASED
INVADED ITS NEIGHBORHOOD
EYES TOWARD DR THOMAS
BECAUSE ALLIGATORS COME IN DIFFERENT SIZES
HE'S AT THE LOUISIANA NATURE THE SCIENCE CENTER
HE WAS VERY T TALL
OTHERWISE IT WOULD BE T TOO DANGEROUS TO CATCH IT BY BY HAND
I WOULD USE
DR THOMAS IS A SCIENTIST HE KNOWS ALL
ITS WET BUMPY HIDE SHONE SHONE IN THE SUN THEN IT CRAWLED BACK IN INTO THE MUDDY WATER
WHAT DO ALLIGATORS EAT BRYAN ASKED WELL DR THOMAS ANSWERED
NOW THIS A GOOD IDEA
THEN THE ALLIGATOR SNAPS IT
THERE WAS ABLE
WHY IS WHY IS ONE LOOP BIGGER THAN THE OTHER ASKED JUDY ANN
THERE TO TELL
BRYAN AND JUDY BRYAN AND JUDY ANN WERE BEST FRIENDS
FINALLY THE ALLIGATOR GREW TOO TIRED TO STRUGGLE
THEIR BICYCLES
THE POLE HAD LOOPS
AS IT STRUGGLED FIERCELY TO GET AWAY
CRIED
OK LET'S GO
BET
TO THE WARN
DEAL
TO
NOW
A CREEK RAN BEHIND THEIR HOUSE
DR THOMAS WOULD FIND A PLACE WHERE WOULD BE FAR FROM PEOPLE
THERE'S THERE'S SOMETHING DOWN IN THE CREEK SEE
THAT WAS GOING TO CATCH THE ALLIGATOR AND TAKE IT TO A PLACE FAR AWAY FROM WHERE PEOPLE LIVE
ANSWERED DR THOMAS
BEARD
DR THOMAS TOOK SOME SOME BIG BLACK RUBBER BANDS FROM HIS POCKET
REPTILES
I DON'T WANT THAT ALLIGATOR GETTING CASSIE MY CAT MY CAT DECLARED JUDY ANN

GENTLY INTO THE CREEK'S BROWN WATER
DEGAS

HE TIED UP
EACH OTHER IN SMALL TOWN WEST OF NEW ORLEANS
NOW IT WAS TIME TO PUT THE ALLIGATOR IN THE BOAT AND BRING IT TO A NEW
WHAT'S UP
SURE ENOUGH A BIG ALLIGATOR WAS RESTING ON THE BANK OF THE CREEK
ALLIGATORS CAN RUN FOR A SHORT DISTANCE BUT THEY CAN'T RUN FAST SO WHY DON'T YOU STAND
TO
DR THOMAS PULLED THE ALLIGATOR TO THE SURFACE
THEY HAD HEARD PLENTY OF ALLIGATOR STORIES FROM THEIR PARENTS AND GRANDPARENTS NOW THEY HAD A TALE FROM THEIR OWN
A BACK BLACK RUBBER BAND FROM ITS POCKET
DR THOMAS LAUGHED ALLIGATORS LIVE HERE LONG BEFORE PEOPLE DID THAT
PULLED ON A HIGH BLACK BOOTS
MR
EXPLAINED WHEN A ALLIGATOR WANTS TO EAT
EXPLAINED THE ALLIGATOR TO THE ABOUT THE ALLIGATOR
SOON DR THOMAS ARRIVED IN A IN A TRUCK THAT HAD WILDLIFE RESCUE PAINTED ON IT
BUT ONCE THE JAWS ARE SHUT
SOUNDS OF THE FROGS AND INSECTS THAT LIVED NEAR THE CREEK

WITH A LONG STORY IF YOU REALLY WANT MY OP
AND I WILL EAT YOU UP SAID THE TIGER BUT BRAHMIN ARGUED SO HARD THAT A LAST
I THINK IT I'LL ASK MATT CASSIE THOUGHT
SO WHAT ALSO TELLS US IT'S WINTER WHERE AUNT RED WING IS
ALRIGHT NOW PRESS NEXT
SHE LOOKED CAREFULLY AT THE GLOBE AUNT RED WING COULD BE IN SOUTH AMERICA OR AUSTRALIA OR MAYBE SHE'S SOMEWHERE IN AFRICA SAID CASSIE
YES I DO CASSIE SAID SHADOWS ARE THE FIRST CLUE TO THE RIDDLE CAN YOU TELL THE SEASONS BY THE LENGTH OF SHADOWS
AND LONG WINTER SHADOWS AT NOON SAID MATT AND AUNT RED WING AND HER RIDDLES RIDDLES LAUGHED CASSIE
WHERE IS IT COLD IN THE MONTH OF JUNE SHE HAD SOME IDEAS BUT THE
LOOK TOO CLOSELY CASSIE TURNED THE POSTCARD OVER
CASSIE TOOK OUT
SINCE THE NOON NOON SUN IS LOW IN WINTER IT MUST BE WINTER WHERE AUNT RED WING IS CASSIE WAS PROUD OF HERSELF
THAT'S RIGHT SAID MATT
PUBLIC LIBRARY CASSIE LIKED TO VISIT HIM THERE AS SHE WALKED TO THE LIBRARY CASSIE READ THE RIDDLE OVER AND OVER AGAIN
WHAT IS THE PICTURE ON THE CARD
BUT I DON'T SEE WHAT IT HAS TO DO WITH THE SEASONS LET'S PRETEND THAT THIS LAMP IS THE SUN SAID MATT WHEN THE LIGHT SHINES FROM ABOVE THE SHADOW IS SHORT DURING THE SUMMER THE NOON SUN IS HIGH IN THE SKY AND SHADOWS ARE SHORTER
WELL SAID CASSIE PEOPLE WHO LIVE SOUTH OF THE EQUATOR HAVE WINTER STARTING IN JUNE AND SUMMER IN JANUARY DON'T THEY THAT'S TRUE SAID MATT
HI SAID MATT WHEN CASSIE CAME
THAT'S RIGHT SAID CASSIE AUSTRALIA HAS
IT WAS FROM AUNT RED WING EVER SINCE AUNT RED WING HAD BEGUN TO TRAVEL SHE HAD PUT POSTCARDS FOR CASSIE IN MOTHER'S LETTERS AUNT RED WING WING TOOK PEOPLE ON TRIPS ALL OVER THE WORLD THE POSTCARDS SHE SENT CASSIE ALWAYS HAD A RIDDLE ABOUT WHERE SHE WAS THIS POSTCARD READ
WHAT'S THE NEXT CLUE THE SECOND CLUE IS THAT THE SUNS SETS SOON CASSIE THOUGHT FOR A MOMENT
THE TWO IS IN THE WAY RIGHT HERE
IS IN WINTER THE SHADOWS ARE LONG
RIGHT AGAIN SAID MATT
MAYBE THERE'S ANOTHER CLUE SAID MATT
YOU CERTAINLY CAN SAID MATT HE REACHED FOR THE LAMP ON HIS DESK LOOK ON THE FLOOR CASSIE WHAT DO YOU SEE WHEN I HOLD THE LAMP LIKE THIS CASSIE LOOKED TO THE FLOOR I SEE A SHORT SHADOW SHE SAID
OK
BUT
BUT I HAVEN'T SOLVED THE RIDDLE YET SAID CASSIE SHE LOOKED AT THE GLOBE ON MATT'S DESK ISN'T ISN'T THIS THE EQUATOR SHE ASKED POINTING TO A LINE AROUND THE MIDDLE OF THE GLOBE THAT'S RIGHT SAID MATT
SHE LAUGHED A KOALA BEAR LOOK MATT IT'S A KOALA BEAR THEY LIVE ONLY IN AUSTRALIA DON'T THEY MATT NODDED WE WERE SO BUSY TRYING TO GUESS THE RIDDLE THAT WE NEVER EVEN LOOKED AT THE PICTURE
CASSIE LOOKED AT THE POSTCARD IT HAD NO POSTMARK OR STAMP BECAUSE IT HAD COME IN A LETTER TO HER MOTHER
A
THAT'S RIGHT SAID MATT
WHEN I HOLD THE LAMP AT AN ANGLE LIKE THE N NOON SUN
NOON SHADOWS ARE LONG THE SUN SETS SOON
IT'S SOME ANIMAL I DIDN'T
AUNT RED WING IS IN A PLACE WHERE THE NOON SHADOWS ARE LONG SAID CASSIE
BUT WHEN I HOLD THE LAMP AT THIS ANGLE THE SHADOW GROWS LONGER
IF IT IS WINTER IN JUNE THEN AUNT RED WING MUST BE SOMEWHERE OUT SOUTH OF THE EQUATOR CASSIE THOUGHT
TO HIS DESK WHAT'S NEW HI SAID CASSIE LOOK WHAT I HAVE ANOTHER POSTCARD FROM AUNT RED WING MATT LAUGHED THAT MEANS YOU HAVE ANOTHER RIDDLE TO FIGURED OUT
KOALA BEARS AND WINTER IN JUNE
CASSIE STUDIED THE RIDDLE I WONDER HOW THE LENGTH OF SHADOWS CAN TELL WHERE AUNT RED WING IS
TO ASK MATT A QUESTION
I KNOW THE SUN SETS MUCH EARLIER IN THE WINTER THAN IT DOES IN THE SUMMER
WHEN THEY REACH THE BOTTOM THE CARS ARE GOING FAST IS ENOUGH TO GET UP THE NEXT HILL BY THEMSELVES
IN YOUR IDEAS FOR YOUR SCIENCE FAIR PROJECT TOMORROW
SURE SAID LISA A MACHINE IS ANYTHING THAT HELPS YOU DO THINGS MORE EASILY SUPPOSE THAT YOU HAD TO CLIMB STRAIGHT UP FROM THE GROUND TO THE TOP OF THE ROLLER COAST OF THAT ROLLER COASTER HILL
THE PARK WAS CALLED FUN STATION LOOK AT THOSE HILLS MIKE I I'LL BET WE COULD NEED SOME BIG GEARS I BET WE WOULD
HIS GOLDEN EARS FLOPPED UP AND DOWN AS HE RAN OVER THE HILLTOP THE BOY PUSHED THE BOYS PUSHED HARDER ON THE PEDALS AS THEY CLIMBED THE STEEP HILL
EATING THIS MEAT WHEN I GET HOME SAID BILL THE DOG HE BEGAN TO CROSS A
JEFF AND MIKE SQUEEZED THEIR HAND THEIR HAND BRAKES TO SLOW DOWN WHEN THEY REACHED THE FENCE JEFF DROPPED TO HIS KNEES HE PEERED THROUGH THE HOLE
BILL GROWLED BUT THE DOG IN THE WATER DID NOT MOVE HE DIDN'T DROP HIS MEAT EITHER
MAKE HIM COME BACK THROUGH THIS HO THE THIS HOLE THE WOMAN LAUGHED HERE IT BE EASIER FOR PUDDLES PUDDLES IF I OPEN THE GATE
PUDDLES
FUN STATION WAS OFF LIMITS UNTIL IT OPENS NEXT SUMMER
PUDDLES WAS NOWHERE IN SIGHT
JUST THEN PUDDLES JUMPED FROM JEFF'S ARMS
AT THE TOP OF THE HILL THE BOYS STOPPED TO CATCH THEIR BREATH
BECAUSE MEAT SLIPPED FROM
THE ROLLER COASTER IS MADE OF SEVERAL S SEVERAL SIMPLE MACHINES SIMPLE MACHINES HAVE ONLY ONE OR TWO PARTS
JEFF
WELL GRAVITY IS A FORCE A FORCE PUSHES OR PULLS THINGS EXPLAINED LISA
YEAH JEFF NODDED GRAVITY IS WHY WE
DO I PUSH NEXT NOW
THAN GO TO GO STRAIGHT UP EXPLAINED LISA THEN MIKE HAD AN IDEA OUR BIKES GO UP HILL
JEFF LOOKED DOWN AT THE FUN STATION FENCE
LISA NODDED YOUR BIKE YOUR BIKE IS MADE OF SEVERAL SIMPLE MACHINES THE PEDALS HELP YOU TURN THE WHEELS THE PEDALS ARE PART OF A SIMPLE MACHINE CALLED THE WHEEL AND AXLE
JEFF WATCHED AS MIKE'S AS MIKE'S CHAIN SLIPPED OVER A LARGER GEAR
COASTED SO FAST DOWN THE HILL THE HILL ON OUR BIKES THAT'S RIGHT LISA REPLIED YOUR BICYCLE AND THE ROLLER COASTER BOTH USE GRAVITY
JEFF LOOKED UP THE
YOU'RE VERY WELCOME SHE SAID COME BACK THIS SUMMER AND LET ME KNOW
WOW IT'S HUGE SAID MIKE
THERE HE SAID TO HIS FRIEND MIKE NOW TRY IT
THE GREEDY DOG ILLUSTRATED BY KIM KELLEY
PAID OFF JEFF WONDERED HOW FAST THEY WERE GOING

JEFF CAUGHT THE PUPPY AND CL AND CLIPPED ON HIS LEASH I GUESS PUDDLES THINKS IT'S TIME TO GO HOME LAUGHED JEFF
HEY HE HAS A BIGGER PIECE OF MEAT THAN I DO HE HE SAID I WANT
I DON'T KNOW IT'S JUST GOT SOMETHING TO DO DO WITH THE GEARS ANSWERED JEFF
THE BOYS JUMPED ON THEIR BIKES AND HEADED
THAT'S JUST ANOTHER NAME FOR A RAMP
MOM HE CRIED THERE GOES PUDDLES CAN WE GO AFTER HI HIM ON OUR BIKES
WHEN AN ENGINE TURNS THE GEARS THE CHAIN PULLS THE CARS UP THE H FIRST IT FIRST HILL THE FIRST HILL IS ALWAYS THE HIGHEST ONE
BY THEMSELVES
NOW DO I
THAT WOULD BE TOUGH SAID JEFF IT IS MUCH EASIER FOR ROLLER COASTER TO CLIMB A RAMP THEN
NEED TO BIG GEARS TO CLIMB CLIMB UP AND STRONG LEGS TOO ADDED MIKE
CHANGE YOUR GEARS MIKE YELLED JEFF
CROSS A STREAM OF
BILL STARED VERY HARD AT THE DOG IN THE WATER BILL THOUGHT IF THAT IF HE C THAT IF HE COULD SCARE HIM THAT THE OTHER DOG WOULD DROP HIS MEAT
PULLED AT HIS LEASH WHILE THE BOYS THANKED THANKED LISA
IN A FEW MINUTES PUDDLES WAS IN JEFF'S ARMS JEFF HUGGED HIM HARD PUDDLES WIGGLED TO GET FREE BUT JEFF WASN'T ABOUT TO LET HIM ESCAPE AGAIN
WHAT'S THE GREAT GRAVITY MACHINE ASKED JEFF A THAT'S THE NAME OF THE ROLLER COASTER LISA POINTED TOWARD THE BIG STEEL STEEL HILLS
JEFF GRIPPED THE CHAIN WITH ONE QUICK PUSH OFF THE PEDAL THE CHAIN WRAPPED AROUND THE GEAR
THE BOYS COASTED DOWN THE HILL ALL THEIR UPHILL PEDALING PAID
JEFF
PUDDLES PUD PUDDLES MIKE AND JEFF SHOUTED BUT PUDDLES DID NOT RETURN THEN OVER THE SOUNDS OF THE WORKERS THEY HEARD A FAMILIAR BARK
HIS MOUTH AND SANK TO THE BOTTOM OF THE STREAM THE DOG IN THE WATER LOST HIS MEAT AT THE SAME TIME AND POOR BILL WENT HOME HUNGRY
MIKE WAS PUZZLED JEFF WHY DID SHIFTING MAKE IT EASIER TO PEDAL
HE STOPPED SUDDENLY AND LOOKED DOWN INTO THE WATER AND ANOTHER DOG LOOKING BACK AT HIM FROM INSIDE THE STREAM
ONE SIMPLE MACHINE IS AN INCLINED PLANE
GEE THANKS HE SAID IT'S LIKE A BRAND NEW BIKE JEFF GRINNED HE LIKED FIXING THINGS THEN HE LOOKED UP JUST IN TIME TO SEE HIS NEW PUPPY RUNNING UP THE HILL
ON A ROLLER COASTER THE CARS WRAPS ARE ATTACHED TO A CHAIN THAT WRAPS AROUND GEARS
GO UP HILL ARE THEY MACHINES
THERE WAS PUDDLES DIGGING UNDER THE GATE OH NO HE GROANED MOM SAID THAT
AS THE BOYS TURNED HOME MIKE THOUGHT ABOUT HIS HOMEWORK I KNOW WHAT I'M GOING TO DO FOR THE SCIENCE FAIR HE ANNOUNCED I'M GOING TO FIGURE OUT HOW THE GEARS WORK ON MY BIKE JEFF SMILED HE PLANNED TO B TO BUILD A ROLLER COASTER FOR HIS CAR COLLECTION HE'D CALL IT THE LITTLE GRAVITY MACHINE
THE HAND BRAKES ARE SIMPLE MACHINES CALLED LEVERS HOW ABOUT THE GEARS ASKED MIKE YOU'RE RIGHT GEARS ARE ALSO SIMPLE MACHINES ANSWERED LISA
BILL BARKED AT THE DOG IN THE WATER HE WAS HE WAS SORRY FOR THAT
BUT THERE THERE IS ONE BIG DIFFERENCE YOUR BIKE HAS PEDALS THE ROLL COASTER CARS HAVE NO PEDALS AND NO ENGINE
HOW YOU LIKE THE ROLLER COASTER RIDE
WOMAN THANK YOU FOR BRINGING PUDDLES OUT NO TH NO PROBLEM SAID THE YOUNG WOMAN MY NAME'S LISA I'M ONE OF THE ENGINEERS BUILDING THE GREAT GRAVITY MACHINE I WAS PLAYING WITH PUDDLES WHEN I HEARD YOU YOU CALL
I CAN SEE WHY THEY CALL IT GREAT BUT WHY ABOUT BUT WHAT ABOUT GRAVITY
MIKE RODE THE BICYCLE DOWN THE DRIVEWAY AND CIRCLED BACK TOWARD JEFF
WHAT A GREAT TIME I'LL HAVE
AND HE IMAGINED HOW FAST THEY COULD GO ON THE ROLLER COASTER
JEFF
FROM THE OTHER SIDE OF THE FENCE A WOMAN SPOKE HAVE YOU LOST YOUR DOG YES CRIED JEFF DO YOU HAVE PUDDLES WELL SAID THE WOMAN I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S IF IT'S PUDDLES BUT I HAVE A FRIENDLY LITTLE COCKER SPANIEL HERE THAT'S PUDDLES CRIED JEFF CAN YOU

I WANT THAT PIECE AND I AM AND I'M GOING TO GET IT
THE BOYS LOOKED DOWN THE HILL BELOW THEY COULD SEE THE ROLLER COASTER IN THE NEW AMUSEMENT PARK
UP THE HILL THEY SAW PUDDLES UP AHEAD
A RAMP IS A MACHINE ASKED MIKE
JEFF'S MOM LOOKED OUT THE WINDOW YES BUT COME HOME IN TIME TO DO YOUR HOMEWORK REMEMBER YOU MUST TURN

HE LOOKED AT LOU LOIS
ON SATURDAY MORNING
TO OR EL OR ELSE BAD THINGS WILL HAPPEN LOOK JOHN I'VE
HE WAS AN EXCELLENT DENTIST BUT HIS REAL LOVE WAS MUSIC
FLIES ANYMORE THEY HAD TO COVER THEIR EARS FROM THE HORRIBLE SOUND
THEY COULDN'T KEEP JOHN IN JAIL SINCE WAS WERE BREAKING ANY LAWS
PLAYED FLUTE DOESN'T SOUND ALL THAT BAD BUT JUST TRY TO IMAGINE SOMEONE SCRATCHING A CHALKBOARD WITH A FORK
FLUTE THE FLIES WERE ANNOYING FLIES WOULD SWAT HIS FLUTE
YOU SHOULD KNOW A LITTLE ABOUT
JOHN THE DENTIST IS DRIVING THE FLIES AWAY
THEY COULDN'T KEEP JOHN IN JAIL AND THEY
THE PEOPLE IN
AND LET HIM PLAY DOWN WHERE NO ONE COULD HEAR HIM
BEFORE THEY KNEW IT THE TOWN WAS FILLED WITH FLIES
OH THAT'S A NICE INSTRUMENT BUT
WAS SHAPED MADE HIS FLUTE SOUND AWFUL WE CAN'T HE WE CAN'T LET YOU PLAY THE FLUTE ANYMORE JOHN
THE LOCAL DENTIST DR
THEY COULDN'T SWAT THEM OFF IT WAS GROSS THEN SUDDENLY THE FLIES
THE TOWN DENTIST EVERYBODY'S TEETH WERE MUCH WHITER AND CLEANER AND NO ONE HAD ANY CAVITIES SO THE THERE W WAS A PROBLEM IN
AND GUESS WHAT IT WORKED
BUT IT WAS VERY UPSET AT FIRST THEN HE SAID OH WELL GOOD THING I BROUGHT MY OLD FLUTE AS BACK UP
THANKFULLY SOMEONE WAS DIGGING A HOLE AND FOUND WATER
THAT DIDN'T WORK
THAN THOUSANDS OF FLIES CRAWLING ON THEM
PLAYER WAS ROOSTER JOHN HE WASN'T CALLED ROOSTER JOHN YET
THEY WERE THE WERE UP ON THE MAIN FLOAT A BIG BAND PLAYED AS THEY MARCHED UP AND DOWN MAIN STREET
SAID THE POLICE CHIEF S SAID POLICE CHIEF SANDERS THE NEIGHBORS ARE COMPLAINING AND THE CATS AND DOGS ARE TRYING TO CHEW OFF THEIR EARS
SAID CHIEF SANDERS
HOWEVER FOR SOME REASON
WINDOWS WERE BREAKING
THE PEOPLE AS
FLUTE SOUNDED WHEN THIS GUY PLAYED IT I'M SERIOUS STILL IT'S NOT AS BAD AS MILLIONS OF FLIES I SUPPOSE
SO THERE WAS NOTH SO THERE WAS NOTHING
AT THEM WITH HIS HAND OR EVEN HIS NEW FLUTE
FRANKSVILLE WAS A TOWN THAT SEEMED TO HAVE ONE PROBLEM AFTER THE OTHER
NICE TEETH SO THEY SO THEY
IT TO TAKE
TO CELEBRATE THE FACT FOR ONCE THERE THERE WAS NO WATER PROBLEM NO FLY PROBLEM AND NO FLUTE PROBLEM
FRANKSVILLE
BUT AN ECHO IN THE WELL THE FLUTE SOUND LOUDER
HE THOUGHT IF THAT HE MADE A NEW MOUTHPIECE
DR WONG THOUGHT FOR A SECOND THEN PRONOUNCED
OUT JOHN COULD PLAY IT QUITE WELL
WHAT
WONG BUT IT WAS TOO LATE JOHN HAD STARTED PLAYING SWAT AT THE TOWNSFOLK
THEN THE FLIES STOPPED
A FLY LANDED ON A LITTLE GIRL THEN A FLY LANDED ON SOMEONE ELSE THEN SOME LANDED ON A BUNCH OF PEOPLE PRETTY SOON TONS OF FLIES TONS OF FLIES
LOOKED REALLY SILLY AT THE DANCES DANCING TO MUSIC THEY COULDN'T HEAR THEY JUST COULDN'T LEAD A NORMAL LIFE
JOHN NO
ROOSTER JOHN BEFORE I TELL YOU ABOUT ROOSTER JOHN
LIKE A ROOSTER AND PLAY TO KEEP THE FLIES AWAY
SOUND SO MUCH THAT HE THREW JOHN IN JAIL
HE WAS THE
I HAVE TO
HEARD YOU PLAY THE CLARINET YOU'RE QUITE GOOD WHY DON'T YOU PLAY THAT INSTEAD
HE PLAYED MANY MUSICAL INSTRUMENTS SUCH AS GUITAR THE TUBA THE PIANO AND THE CLARINET
SO OF
THE FLIES WOULD LAND ALL OVER
UP
BECAUSE THEY ALL HAD SUCH
AND IT WAS THEN THAT THE PEOPLE OF FRANKSVILLE REAL REALIZED THAT THEY WOULD HAVE TO
PLAY THE FLUTE NORMALLY
TOWN DECIDED TO HAVE A GREAT BIG PARADE IN FRANKSVILLE
DIDN'T WANT TO KICK OUT OF OUT OF TOWN
OH NO CRY CRY CHIEF SANDERS JUST WHEN THINGS WERE WERE GOING GOOD FOR
JOHN THOUGHT THAT WAS AN OK IDEA BUT
IT'S JUST NOT THE FLUTE I EVEN WROTE YOU A SONG CHIEF SANDERS IT'S CALLED COPS AND ROBBERS THEN HE PLAYED THE SONG
WONG CAME UP WITH AN IDEA
DR WONG WAS THE TOWN HERO THE FLUTE SOUNDED NORMAL AND IT TURNED
IN THE LITTLE TOWN OF OF FRANKVILLE OF OF FRANKSVILLE
FLEW AWAY FAST AS THEY COULD
SOON AFTER THAT STARTED TO GET THE FLIES THEY GOT TONS AND TONS OF FLIES
NO NO PLEASE DON'T PLAY YOUR OLD FLUTE BEGGED DR
THEN SUDDENLY
NO ONE COULD HEAR ANYTHING PEOPLE WERE GETTING INTO CAR ACCIDENTS AND EVERYBODY
FROM THEN ON JOHN WOULD WAKE UP AT SUNRISE
THE POLICE CHIEF HATED THE SO
EVERYONE CHEERED
THAT CAME LATER
BUT I HAVE TO PLAY I WAS BORN TO DO IT I DON'T KNOW WHY BUT I FEEL LIKE
OH
THE WAY HIS MOUTH WAS
AND ALL THE COWS IN TOWN STARTED TO MAKE SOUR MILK
THE POLICE COULD DO BESIDES EVERYBODY LOVED JOHN SINCE HE HAD BECOME
IT INTO
THEIR PROBLEMS STARTED OUT WHEN THEY RAN OUT OF WATER
HE STARTED SHAKING THE FLUTE TO GET THE FLIES OFF AND ACCIDENTALLY SMASHED PIECES
DECIDED THAT JOHN COULD PLAY THE FLUTE AND EVERYBODY ELSE WOULD HAVE TO WEAR EARPLUGS WELL I'M SURE YOU GUESSED THAT
THE GOOD WITH THE BAD BECAUSE AS BAD AS THE FLUTE SOUNDED IT WAS A LOT BAD BETTER
THE BAD FLUTE
DR WONG AND JOHN WERE THE STARS OF THE PARADE
ES ESPECIALLY SHAPED FOR JOHN'S MOUTH
WHAT SHOULD THEY DO THE
THE
IT'S THE FLUTE SOUND THE FLIES HATE JOHN'S FLUTE PLAYING AS MUCH AS WE DO
BUT JUST THEN A MAN MOVED INTO TOWN WHO PLAYED THE FLUTE SO BADLY THAT PEOPLE WOULD RUN STOPPED RUN AWAY SCREAMING THIS MAYBE
THEN HE SAID
SO THEY DECIDED TO LOWER HIM DOWN A WELL
WERE LANDING ON EVERYONE
A POORLY
WHEN THE TOWNSFOLK HEARD THE NOISE THEY COULDN'T EVEN SWAT
GOT HIS NAME I SHOULD TELL
WHAT TO DO SO HE JUST KEPT ON PIECES
WAS THE NEW TOWN DENTIST
T
UHM

AND READ THE WORDS BIG
WHAT IS ROCK SLIDE AXED ASKED LAURA
SO MUCH MAYBE SHE WOULD HAVE BEEN WITH HER CAT INSTEAD THE CAT CAME INTO MY
FUR HE WOULDN'T SNEEZE AND THAT
OPINION THOUGH I'LL BET YOU DIDN'T KNOW SOMETHING ELSE
LIKED OSCAR AS MUCH AS THE CAT
HEADS OUT AND BE NOT CUDDLY CAN I GET A DOG PLEASE
WHAT DAD CALLS LIFE EXPERIENCE NOT THAT I SHAVED THE CAT THOUGH
OH SURE IT'S EASY TO SAY THAT I SHOULD HAVE JUST PICKED THE CAT UP BUT SOMETIMES WE DON'T ALWAYS THINK
IT ON PURPOSE
IT GOT REALLY HOT
IN
YOU WOULD HAVE A BETTER MARRIAGE
ELSE DID YOU KNOW THAT I WANTED TO BE A BARBER
ANYWAY
DON'T LET DAD KNOW THAT
A GOOD STUDENT
PER
CATS DON'T OVERHEAT IN WINTER
BESIDES THE REAL REASON I SHAVED THE CAT WAS TO KEEP IT NICE AND COOL
DEAR MOM AND DAD PARENTS SINCE YOU HAVE GROUNDED ME AND TOLD T ME TO WRITE DOWN WHY I AM SORRY BEFORE I WAS ALLOWED OUT OF MY ROOM I AM MAD AT YOU I WOULD L
I THINK IT REALLY LIKED ITS HAIRCUT THE ONLY REASON IT HASN'T COME
CAT
COULD TAKE HER
ACCIDENT TURNED ON THE NOSE HAIR CLIPPERS AND THE
GET A STUPID TURTLE ANYWAY
CAT WAS THAT I WANT TO BE A BARBER AND I NEEDED PRACTICE I WAS AFRAID YOU WOULDN'T LET ME PRACTICE ON MY OWN HEAD CAN I PRACTICE BY SHAVING JENNY'S HEAD I PROMISE THAT
I KNEW OUR CAT WOULD GROW HER FUR BACK BUT SOME CATS DON'T HAVE HAIR
YOU HATE
DEAR MOM AND DAD JENNY DIDN'T BRUSH HER TEETH LAST NIGHT I THINK THAT SHE SH
SHE SAID WHAT THAT WHEN WE SHOULD SHAVE HAIR IT GROWS BACK HARDER AND SOMETIMES EVEN DARKER SO I THOUGHT THAT IF I COULD SHAVE THE CAT A LOT OF A BUNCH OF TIMES HER HAIR WOULD GROW BACK HARDER
PLUS
WINTER I
THAT IT'S REALLY JENNY'S FAULT FOR NOT BEING AS RESPONSIBLE AS YOU'RE
ENOUGH
NOT SHAVE IT ITSELF
YOU AND YOU KNOW WHAT THE STUPID GERBILS DIDN'T EVEN
OK HERE'S WHAT HAPPENED AS I REMEMBER IT
PICK THE CAT UP BUT SOMETIMES WE DON'T ALWAYS THINK
FINE OSCAR CAN'T REALLY TALK BUT IF HE COULD HE WOULD S HAVE SAID
S INVINCIBLE COAT
IT WAS REALLY MY FATHER'S DAY GIFT TO HIM SO I COULDN'T BUY HIM ANYTHING NICE SINCE YOU TOOK AWAY MY ALLOWANCE FOR WHEN I SHAVED THE NEIGHBOR'S DOG
REALLY RE
I
I KNEW
SHE'S REALLY RESPONSIBLE
SHOULD I STOP
SO IN CONCLUSION I'M GETTING HUNGRY AND I'M SORRY FOR SHAVING THE CAT
BUT SO WHAT IF
THAT'S
IN
I FORGOT TO TELL YOU THAT YOU SHOULD BE BLAMING MRS CAS MRS
YOU GUYS WILL JUST PROBABLY SAY IT'S WINTER DANNY
BUT FOR
TO START BY SAYING THAT I THINK THAT YOU ARE VERY MEAN TO MAKE ME DO THIS BECAUSE IT WASN'T EVEN MY FAULT
KEEPS HITTING ME ON THE SHELL AND TRYING TO ROLL ME OVER
THIS AND POOR KITTY THAT
COLLEGE EVEN IF SHE IS A DUMB LITTLE TATTLE TALE SHE'S SO GOOD AT SCHOOL YOU
BE
CAT CAUSE
CAT NOW HOW TO LISTEN SO SHE JUST IGNORED ME
ALWAYS SNEEZING AND STUFF SO I THOUGHT IF
THAT'S JUST MY
SHE WOULD HAVE AN
YOU ALWAYS SAY AND NOT BRUSHING HER TEETH P S IF YOU WOULD HAVE BROUGHT HER A TURTLE I COULDN'T HAVE SHAVED IT SINCERELY DANNY
PLUS IF YOU WEREN'T ALWAYS
IT'LL
MY ROOM BECAUSE JENNY NEVER PLAYS WITH IT ANY
S
IF I HAD A CAT I WOULD TEACH IT TO
ALL THAT GREAT UNDER PRESSURE
I REALLY DIDN'T MEAN TO SHAVE THE CAT REALLY I SWEAR
V
PLUS OSCAR MY TURTLE TOLD ME TO SHAVE THE CAT
I WAS AFRAID TO TELL YOU REALLY
SO
ACTUALLY THE TRUTH IS THAT
DIDN'T MEAN SHE REALLY RESPONSIBLE
THE REAL REASON I SHAVED THE CAT WAS THAT HE'S ALWAYS SNEEZING AROUND IT
YOU WOULDN'T ALWAYS TAKE THE CAT'S SIDE IF YOU KNEW THE STUFF HE DID TO MY POOR TURTLE CAT'S AREN'T ALWAYS NICE JUST LIKE MY SISTER JENNY ISN'T ALWAYS NICE
SO I
WINTER
MY SCIENCE TEACHER SHE MADE US HAVE
I JUST DIDN'T WANT TO SEE THE CAT GETTING ALL HOT AND UNCOMFORTABLE AND STUFF
PLUS
PROUD OF ME
LIKE
ON T V SHOWS AND GET LOTS OF MONEY SO THAT YOU CAN SEND JENNY TO
OUT FOR TWO WEEKS IS BECAUSE YOU GUYS MADE SUCH A BIG DEAL ABOUT IT POOR KITTY SH THIS
IT T
I'LL DO A BETTER JOB THEN I DID ON THE
ANYWAY TURTLES DON'T DO ANYTHING EXCEPT POKE THEIR HEADS OUT AND
CAT WAS BEING CHASED BY THE TURTLE AND RAN RIGHT BY THE SLIP CLIPPERS AND SHAVED HER OFF SELF I KEPT SAYING NO KITTY NO DON'T HAVE SHAVE YOURSELF BUT MY STUPID SISTER NEVER TAUGHT HER
SHOULD BRUSH HER TEETH TWICE TONIGHT
HIM
THEY ARE CALLED HAIRLESS CATS AND THEY NEED FUR IN THE WINTER SOMETIMES I THINK I SWEAR THAT'S THE REASON ALSO I WAS GOING TO SELL THE CAT F FUR AND BUY MY SISTER JENNY BRACES FOR HER BIG STUPID FACE
AL
IT W
MEAN
BACK HARDER EACH TIME AND SOON
THE CAT LIKED BEING SHAVED
THANK ME THEY JUST RAN ON THAT STUPID WHEEL AND DID STUPID THINGS THAT'S THE LAST TIME I SHAVE THE CAT TO PROTECT ANY STUPID GERBILS
I SAW THAT THE CAT WAS
OF CAT FUR ARMOR THEN SHE WOULD BE A SUPER CAT AND YOU
ANYWAY SO I DID DON'T SEE THE BIG DEAL
SAID PLEASE SHAVE THE CAT
I BE
THE REALLY REASON I SHAVED THE CAT
HOW COME JENNY'S JENNY GETS A CAT AND I
LAST NIGHT I SAW THAT SHE DIDN'T BRUSH HER TEETH OH YEAH I FORGOT TO TELL YOU THAT
HOW MUCH
I
FOR SURE I DON'T HAVE TO GET GOOD GRADES TO KNOW THAT YOU SHOULD TEACH A CAT TO SHAVE ITSELF
IT'S WINTER
ALTHOUGH YOU CAN SEE THAT'S
SHE MADE US SHAVE SOMETHING FOR SCIENCE ASK HER
AL I JUST WANTED THE CAT TO GET USED TO THE IDEA BEFORE
JUST CAUSE SHE'S G GOOD STUDENT
DEAR MOM
DANNY

CALLED
EXCEPT ALL EXCEPT TWO
YOU HAVE TO REMEMBER THAT EVEN THOUGH HE'S GIFTED AT BEING SLOW HE'S STILL VERY YOUNG AND SAID SWISH'S FATHER
THIS TIME IT WAS A BIT CLOSER THAN YOU WOULD HAVE LIKED I'LL BET
HE TOLD HIS MOM YOU KNOW WHAT I'M GOING TO WIN THIS RACE
MUD SAID TO SWISH THERE'S NO WAY THAT A TURTLE AS YOUNG AS YOU CAN BE SO SLOW EVEN I WAS FASTER THAN YOU WHEN I WAS YOUR AGE
FINALLY AFTER THE LONG JOURNEY ALL THE TURTLES ARRIVED AT GREAT POND
MUD STILL DIDN'T ANSWER IN FACT MUD WAS SOUND ASLEEP MUD HAD ACTUALLY SUNG HIMSELF TO SLEEP
SWISH WAS SAD THAT HE LOST BUT ALL THE TURTLES FROM BLUE POND CHEERED FOR SWISH
JUST TO GET TO THE RACE
EVERY S SEEN
THEY LOOKED AT THE HORIZON AND SAW THE SUN WAS STARTING THE RISE
HIS NAME WAS MUD
YOU KNOW MY GRANDFATHER RACED MUD ONCE
THERE WAS LOTS OF EATING AND LAUGHING
EVERYONE TREATED SWISH DIFFERENTLY FOR EXAMPLE
GO SLOW INSTEAD ALL THE TURTLE MUST GO AS FAST AS THEY CAN AT ALL TIMES
SWISH AND MUD WERE BOTH BACK AT THE STARTING LINE IT LOOKED AS IF NEITHER OF THEM HAD MOVED AT ALL
ONCE HIS MOTHER CALLED HIM FOR IN FOR DINNER AND HE DIDN'T MAKE IT HOME UNTIL BREAKFAST THE NEXT MORNING AND HE WAS
THAT'S BECAUSE NO ONE COULD EVER BEAT THE TURTLE FROM THERE
BUT THOUGH HE
I NEVER PROMISED THAT I WOULD WIN THE RACE
HOW COME THEY DON'T MOVE THAT BIG ROCK OUT OF THE MIDDLE OF THE FIELD IT SEEMS TO BE IN EVERYONE'S WAY SAID SWISH
HE WAS THE BIGGEST MOST RESPECTED AND ONE OF THE TRICKIEST TURTLES IN HISTORY
EVERY FOUR YEARS TURTLES FROM ALL OVER THE LAND WOULD CRAWL TO GREAT POND
THE TURTLE CUP WAS THE TROPHY THAT
ALL THE OTHER TURTLES AT
MS TORT WENT UP TO SWISH AND GAVE HIM THE TURTLE CUP
A NEW TURTLE BORN IN BLUE POND
AFTER SEVEN DAYS OF PLAYING AND DANCING A BUG EATING FINALLY
THERE WERE THOUSANDS OF TURTLES OF MANY DIFFERENT SPECIES ALL HAVING A GREAT NAME
THEN MUD TRIED ANOTHER TRICK
SWISH TOOK THE CUP THAT DAY
MS SNAPPER WOULD SAY HI SWISHY DO YOU WANT SOME YUMMY PIE TO FILL UP AND SLOW YOU DOWN FOR THE BIG RACE A FAT TURTLE AND IS A SLOW TURTLE
YOU AREN'T RUNNING
HAD ONLY MOVED A FEW INCHES
MOST NICE TURTLES LIVED IN BLUE POND
RULE NUMBER ONE THE GREAT RACE BEGINS AT SUNRISE AND ENDS AT SUNSET
HE HADN'T HAD TO MOVE FOR OVER FIFTY YEARS
RIGHT AT THE END RIGHT BEFORE THE SUNSET SWISH STARTED TO PULL AHEAD OF MUD
MUCH GREATER OR BIGGER THAN MUD
THERE WERE ABOUT THREE HUNDRED TURTLES RACING
WHAT YOU THINK LIKE TO SAY
MUD KEPT SINGING HIS LULLABY FOR A FEW HOURS BUT STOPPED RIGHT BEFORE SUNSET
HE THOUGHT IT WAS THE MOST WONDERFUL THING EVER
MUD FROM SLUDGE POND HAS BEEN DISQUALIFIED FOR SLEEPING DURING THE RACE
SAID SWISH'S MOM
EXCEPT FOR MUD OF COURSE
WHEN MUD WAS HI IN HIS PRIME THERE WAS
YOU''RE JUST TRYING TO MAKE ME QUIT I'M NOT GOING TO FALL FOR YOUR TRICKS HE SAID TURTLES NEVER CHEAT AND I'M A TURTLE WITH HONOR
EVERYTHING ABOUT THE FESTIVAL WAS FUN BUT THE MAIN EVENT WAS THE GREAT TURTLE RACE
WE ALL WANT YOU TO LOOK GOOD WHEN YOU BRING HOME THE CUP
RULE NUMBER FOUR NO TURTLE MAY FALL ASLEEP SINCE IF YOU ARE ASLEEP YOU CAN'T
AFTER SIX HOURS MUD AND SWISH WERE STILL TIED AND
ONLY A FOOT AWAY
THE RULES WERE NAILED TO A TREE THEY READ
THE CROWD THOUGHT H HE MUST HAVE REALIZED THAT IT WASN'T WORKING BUT THEN
IMAGINE HE HAD
BECAME THE GREATEST TURTLE OR AND BIGGEST TURTLE OF ALL TIME
THE SLOWEST TURTLES FROM EACH POND WERE CARRIED TO THE STARTING LINE BY MEMBERS OF THEIR VILLAGE
SWISH MADE A LOUD GULP SOUND
THERE WAS MANY LEGENDS ABOUT HIM
WHEN ALL THE TU
RULE NUMBER THREE NO TURTLE MAY PRETEND TO BE GOING AS FAST AS THEY CAN BUT
I THINK THAT YOU'LL BE A GREAT CHAMPION FOR MANY YEARS SINCE TURTLES ONLY GET SLOWER WITH AGE
WHEN SWISH WAS BORN EVERYONE THOUGHT HE WAS A LITTLE SLOW BUT AS HE GOT A LITTLE OLDER
THE WINNER WOULD TAKE HOME TO THEIR VILLAGE
SWISH READ THE RULES EVEN THOUGH HE KNEW THEM BY HEART
IT WAS BECAUSE OF SWISH THAT BLUE POND BECAME THE MOST RESPECTED POND IN THE LAND
BUT AFTER A FEW HOURS THE MOST OF THE TURTLES HAD GONE A FEW FEET
THE MAYOR OF GREAT POND WENT TO PRESENT THE TURTLE CUP TO SLUDGE POND AGAIN
SWISH S STARTED YAWNING HE WAS TIRED FROM RACING AND THOUGHT THAT IT WOULD BE NICE JUST TO LISTEN TO MUD'S SWEET VOICE AND FALL ASLEEP
LOOK THERE'S YOUR COUSIN PEEK A BOO FROM BIG PUDDLE VILLAGE AND SWISH'S MOTHER YOU'LL GET TO MEET ALL SORTS OF NEW TURTLES
MISTER PEEKS WOULD NEVER DO ANYTHING FOR FREE BUT HE WAS GIVING SWISH A FREE SHELL WAXING
AS FAST AS YOU CAN
MUD KNEW THAT THIS WOULD BE HIS CLOSEST RACED EVER AND HE WAS ACTUALLY GETTING A LITTLE BIT SCARED OF S THIS SWISH KID
SWISH HAD TO BE CARRIED ON HIS FATHER'S BACK
THE CROWD STARTED YELLING SPEECH SPEECH
SO WITH SWISH THEY COULD
AND WHEN THE SUN WENT DOWN MUD WAS THE CLOSEST TURTLE TO THE STARTING LINE
IT'S JUST AN HONOR
THE MAYOR DOCTOR SOFTSHELL SAID THIS IS RIDICULOUS SWISH HAS TO RACE
THE TURTLES STRETCHED AND THOUGHT REALLY SLOW THOUGHTS AS THEY DID THE SKY
WE NEVER THOUGHT OF THAT THEY AGREED
HE PUT EARPLUGS IN HIS EARS AND COULDN'T HEAR MUD'S SINGING ANYMORE
I KNOW IT AND ALL THESE TURTLES WILL KNOW THAT
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN SAID MS TORT
YOU'RE CHEATING YOU'RE GOING TO RUIN THE GREAT RACE FOREVER
THIS WAS SWISH'S FIRST EVER SHELL DWELLERS FESTIVAL
THEY WERE VERY PROUD AND GAVE MUD SUCH A
AND HE WAS THE GREATEST CHAMPION OF THE H IN THE HISTORY OF SHELL DWELLERS FESTIVAL HE WAS UNBEATABLE
HE WASN'T AS SLOW AS YOU BUT HE DID TEACH ME A THING OR TWO
JUST THEN THE MAYOR SAID READY SET SLOW AND OFF THEY WENT
MISTER PEEKS HE THE LOCAL SHELL CLEANER WOULD SAY HEY THERE SWISH DO YOU WANT A FREE SHELL WAXING TODAY
I WOULD LIKE TO PRESENT THE TURTLE CUP TO BLUE POND
SINCE TURTLES NEVER CHEAT THIS IS THE MOST IMPORTANT RULE TO BREAK THIS RULE WOULD MEAN TO END TO THE GREAT TURTLE RACE FOREVER
TURTLES COULD CATCH UP WITH FRIENDS THEY HAD NOT SEEN SINCE THE LAST FESTIVAL
BUT SWISH WOULDN'T LET MUD SCARE HIM
P POSTED THE RULES OF THE RACE FOR EVERYONE TO SEE
THEN THEY THE TOWN PROMISED TO TREAT SWISH LIKE A NORMAL TURTLE AND AFTER A WHILE SWISH DECIDED
THEY WERE BOTH MOVING OF COURSE BUT THEY WERE SO SLOW THAT IT WAS HARD TO TELL
I CAN'T BEAT MUD ANYWAY I HEARD ONCE IT TOOK HIM THREE DAYS JUST TO YAWN
RUNNERS PLEASE TAKE YOUR POSITIONS
HE WAS THE SLOWEST TURTLE OF ALL TIME
THAT'S NOT A ROCK SWEETIE SAID HIS MOM THAT'S MUD
THAT WAS THE MOST EXCITING FINISH WE WE'VE EVER HAD
IT WOULD TAKE SOME TURTLES F FROM FAR AWAY VILLAGES TWO WHOLE WEEKS JUST TO GET THERE
THE DAY OF THE RACE CAME
THIS TURTLE WAS NAMED SWISH
FOR THE FIRST TIME HE WOULD TAKE IT MANY MORE TIMES AFTER THAT
SHE SAID SWISH YOU ARE THE YOUNGEST WINNER OF THE GREAT RACE
HE DEEP DOWN INSIDE HE KNEW HE WAS JUST AS SLOW AS MUD
BUT HE DOESN'T WANT TO BE TREATED SPECIAL HE JUST WANTS TO BE A NORMAL
TIME BEFORE ANYONE COULD FIGURE OUT WHICH TURTLES WERE THE SLOWEST
MS SNAPPER WAS NEVER NICE TO ANYONE BUT SHE WAS BEING NICE TO SWISH
HE STARTED SINGING A SOFT BEAUTIFUL LULLABY
THE FESTIVAL
BUT THEY ALL FELT A LITTLE SAD BECAUSE THEY HADN'T HELD THE TURTLE CUP IN OVER SEVEN HUNDRED YEARS
RULE NUMBER TWO ALL TURTLES MUST RUN AS FAST AS THEY CAN AND THE TURTLE THAT IS CLOSEST TO THE STARTING LINE WINS
WHEN THE TIME OF THE FESTIVAL DREW NEAR ALL THE TURTLES ALL OVER THE LAND STARTED TO CRAWL TOWARD GREAT POND
BY NOW ALL THE TURTLES WERE WAY AHEAD OF MUD BUT THIS TIME SWISH WAS JUST AS SLOW
ALL THE TURTLES IN BLUE POND HELD A MEETING TO DISCUSS THE PROBLEM
HE ALWAYS MADE SURE THAT NO ONE TREATED HIM SPECIAL AND THAT HE TREATED EVERYBODY LIKE HE WANTED TO BE TREATED LIKE A TURTLE WITH HONOR
THEY WERE ALL THE SLOWEST OF SLOW
SMILED AND SAID I KNOW THAT YOU CAN WIN SWISH BUT WE'LL BE PROUD OF YOU EVEN IF YOU DON'T WIN
OH NO SHOUTED THE FANS MUD'S WINNING IT LOOKS LIKE MUDS IS STILL THE GREATEST TURTLE OF THEM ALL
AND WONDERED ABOUT IT
THE SLOWEST TURTLE
THE TUR GET AND THE LONGER THEY LIVE SO YOU CAN SEE WINNING THE GREAT RACE IS A GREAT HONOR
BLUE POND RULES I'M NOT AFRAID OF MUD
THIS MEANS THAT WE HAVE A NEW CHAMPION BUT THE REAL WINNER IS SWISH SOFTBELLY OF BLUE POND THE CROWD WENT WILD
CLOSE RACE
SWISH SAW A BIG ROCK IN THE MIDDLE OF THE BIG FESTIVAL
THEN HE TOLD SWISH ABOUT ALL OF MUD'S DIRTY TRICKS SO THAT SWISH WOULD BE READY FOR THEM
SWISH WAS HAPPY TOO BUT HE DIDN'T
BUT WITHOUT HIM WE DON'T HAVE A CHANCE
ALL THE TURTLES WERE VERY VERY SLOW SO IT TOOK SOME
THE CROWD WENT WILD AGAIN
SAW
THE WINNER OF THE GREAT TURTLE RACE WAS SO IMPORTANT THAT THE WINNER DIDN'T HAVE TO MOVE FOR FOUR YEARS UNTIL THE NEXT FESTIVAL
BLUE POND WAS LOCATED ABOUT THREE DAYS CRAWL FROM GREAT POND
THAT HE WOULD BE PROUD TO RACE FOR HIS VILLAGE
SO ONE DAY HE TOLD HIS PARENTS I DON'T WANT TO RACE
SWISH'S MOM
IT WAS RUMORED HE WAS SO SLOW HIS HEART WOULD ONLY BEAT ONCE A DAY
SWISH'S FATHER SAID SON DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT
TURNED FROM BLACK TO DARK BLUE
THEY THOUGHT MAYBE JUST MAYBE HE COULD BRING BACK THE TURTLE CUP
FOR THE FIRST TIME IN SEVEN HUNDRED YEARS
THE TURTLES BEGAN TO REALIZE THAT SWISH WAS REALLY REALLY REALLY SLOW
THE MAYOR OF GREAT POND MS TORT
SURE THEY ARE NICE TO ME NOW BECAUSE THEY THINK I CAN WIN THE RACE BUT IF I LOSE THEY'LL BE DISAPPOINTED AND MAD AT ME
HE WENT HE WOULD NEVER LOSE THE TURTLE CUP FOR THE REST OF HIS LONG LIFE
THEN HE HEARD THE MAYOR SAY
THE TURTLE CUP WAS IN SLUDGE POND O FOR OVER FIFTY YEARS
SHE ANNOUNCED WELL MUD IT LOOKS LIKE YOU'VE DONE IT SLUDGE POND WINS THE TURTLE CUP AGAIN
AND HE DOESN'T WANT EVERYBODY TO HATE HIM IF HE CAN'T BEAT MUD
ALL THE EXTRA ATTENTION MADE SWISH VERY UNCOMFORTABLE
THEN HE SNAPPED OUT OF IT AND REMEMBERED HIS FATHER TOLD HIM ABOUT THIS TRICK
SWISH WAS SUDDENLY VERY EXCITED
MUD DIDN'T ANSWER THE MAYOR TAPPING MUD ON THE SHELL AND SAID HELLO HELLO MUD
WHO IS THIS YOUNG PUNK HE THOUGHT TO HIMSELF
SINCE IT WOULD HAVE TAKEN HIM YEARS TO GET TO GREAT POND BY HIMSELF
HE WAS THE SLOWEST TURTLE I'VE EV
BREATHING A GREAT SIGH OF RELIEF THAT'S WHEN BROTHER BEAR LOOKED UP AT HIS FINGERNAILS AND PIPED UP
SISTER NIBBLES HER NAILS SISTER NIBBLES HER NAILS IT DIDN'T TAKE SISTER LONG TO DECIDE TO PULL OFF THOSE BITS OF TAPE
YOU KNOW I THINK I JU I MIGHT START BITING MY NAILS I COULD USE THE MONEY
BEFORE MAMA COULD ANSWER SISTER BEAR WHO HAD WHO HAD BEEN NERVOUS NERVOUSLY NIBBLING IN THE NEXT ROOM POPPED IN AND SAID A DIME TEN WHOLE CENTS EVERY DAY JUST FOR NOT BITING MY NAILS
THAT'S THE WAY IT IS WITH A BAD HABIT THE MORE YOU USE IT THE HARDER IT IS TO GET OUT OF IT HERE THIS IS WHERE I WANT TO PLANT THE BULBS
WHAT AN INTERESTING IDEA SAID MAMA AS SHE LISTENED TO THE WISE OLD GRIZZLY GRAN
YOU'VE NIBBLED D YOUR NAILS DOWN TO NUBBINS IN FACT YOU'VE NIBBLED THEM CLEAN OFF HOW DID IT HAPPEN
BY STAN AND JAN BERENSTAIN
AND SISTER NIBBLED HER NAILS NIBBLE NIBBLE NIBBLE NIBBLE
ALL SHE GOT WAS DISCOURAGED
I COULD READ THE RIOT ACT TO HER
IT'S VERY HARD TO HOLD A PENCIL WITH TAPE AND ALL OVER YOUR FINGERTIPS OR TUNE THE TV OR SCRATCH WHEN YOU HAVE AN ITCH AND WHEN SISTER TRIED TO PLAY JACKS SHE COULDN'T GET ANY HIGHER THAN TW TWOSIES
THE BERENSTAIN BEARS AND THE BAD HABIT
IS SOMETHING YOU DO SO OFTEN YOU DON'T EVEN HAVE TO THINK ABOUT IT HABITS ARE A VERY IMPORTANT PART OF OUR LIVES AND MOST OF THEM ARE GOOD LIKE BRUSHING YOUR TEETH AND COMBING YOUR FUR WHEN YOU GET UP IN THE MORNING AND LOOKING BOTH WAYS BEFORE YOU CROSS A ROAD
BY THE WAY IT TUR BUT THE WAY IT TURNED OUT SHE DIDN'T GET A SINGLE DIME
THERE WAS QUITE A LOT OF WORK SPELLING NUMBER PROBLEMS AND ALL KINDS OF THINGS
HMM SAID MAMA WELL HERE'S WHAT WE'LL DO WE'LL PUT A LITTLE MEDICINE ON THE SORE ONES AND BITS OF ADHESIVE TAPE ON ALL OF THEM THAT WILL REMIND YOU NOT TO NIBBLE AND WILL GIVE THEM BACK A CHANCE TO GROW BACK
I SUPPOSE SO SAID PAPA THOUGHTFULLY PERHAPS SOME SORT OF REWARD WOULD HELP A BIT OF MONEY LET'S SAY A DIME FOR EVERY DAY SHE DOESN'T BITE HER NAILS
FIRST THERE HAD BEEN A BEEN NURSERY SCHOOL WHICH WAS PURE FUN PLAYING WITH DOLLS AND BLOCKS ROLLING CLAY SNAKES AND SCRIBBLING WITH CRAYONS
WELL SAID MAMA IT'S SORT OF LIKE THIS PATH I'VE WHEELED THIS BARROW OVER IT SO MANY TIMES THAT I'VE IT'S WORN A DEEP RUT RIGHT DOWN THE MIDDLE
BEFORE SHE KNEW IT SHE HAD NIBBLED DOWN TO NUB NIB NUBBINS IN FACT SHE NIBBLED THEM DOWN SO FAR THAT SOME OF HER FINGERS WERE GETTING SORE
OH WELL SIGHED MAMA LIFE GOES ON I MUST CALL GRAN AND THANK HER FOR THE TULIP BULBS
DEAR ME NO SAID MAMA NAIL BITING IS A KIND OF NERVOUS HABIT AND SHOUTING AND THREATENING WILL JUST MAKE HER MORE NERVOUS
GREAT FOR PICKING THINGS UP TUNING THE TV AND SCRATCHING ITCHES AND THE NEXT TIME SHE PLAYED JACKS SHE GOT ALL THE WAY TO TENSIES
I CERTAINLY HOPE YOU'RE JOKING ROARED PAPA BECAUSE IF YOU'RE NOT I'M JOKING I'M JOKING INTERRUPTED BR BROTHER AND HE WAS SORT OF
A HABIT MAMA SAID AS SHE WELL PUSHED THE WHEELBARROW ALONG WITH THE ALONG THE WELL WORN PATH
NOW SISTER WAS IN FIRST GRADE REGULAR REGULAR SCHOOL WAS DIFFERENT IT WAS STILL FUN AND SHE LIKED TEACHER JANE VERY MUCH BUT IT WASN'T ALL FUN
THAT'S RIGHT SAID PAPA UNTIL THE HABIT'S BROKEN I'LL NEVER NIBBLE AGAIN SHE SAID AS SHE THOUGHT OF ALL THOSE LOVELY DIMES SHE WAS GOING TO GET
WHAT ABOUT MY NAIL BITING HABIT ASKED SISTER AS SHE HELPED MAMA GET OUT OF THE DEEP RUT HOW AM I GOING TO GET OUT OF IT
I'M NOT EXACTLY SURE MAMA SH SISTER SAID BUT SOME OF THEM ARE GETTING SORE
SO THEY TRIED GRAN'S IDEA INSTEAD OF A DIME AT THE END OF EACH DAY THEY GAVE SISTER TEN PENNIES ONE FOR EACH NAIL AND AT THE BEGINNING OF EACH DAY TEN PENNIES TO KEEP UNLESS SHE NIBBLED
BUT WORST OF ALL THE BITS OF TAPE TOLD THE WHOLE WORLD THAT SISTER BEAR WAS A NAIL NIBBLER
SISTER BEAR WHO LIVED WITH MA MAMA PAPA AND BROTHER IN THE T BIG TREE HOUSE DOWN A SUNNY DIRT ROAD DEEP IN BEAR COUNTRY HAD BEEN GOING TO SCHOOL FOR QUITE A WHILE
OH YES SAID SISTER BUT I KEEP FORGETTING WHY IS IT SO HARD TO REMEMBER
LIKE NAIL BITING ASKED SISTER YOU WOULD LIKE TO NAIL YOUR HAVE YOU NICE NAILS GROW BACK WOULDN'T YOU WAS MAMA'S ANSWER
A DAY IS A LONG TIME AND HABITS ARE POWERFUL ESPECIALLY BAD HABITS EVEN WITH THE PROMISE OF A DIME SISTER COULDN'T REMEMBER NOT TO NIBBLE MAMA AND PAPA GOT DISCOURAGED TOO
BUT EVEN BETTER SHE HAD TEN FINE FINGERNAILS
LIZZY TWIRLED HER FOR FUR TWIRL TWIRL TWIRL FREDDY SCRATCHED HIS HEAD SCRATCH SCRATCH SCRATCH NORMAN SUCKED HIS THUMB SUCK SUCK SUCK
BUT SOME HABITS AREN'T SO GOOD
IN REGULAR SCHOOL YOU HAVE TO CONCENTRATE AND SOMETIMES WHEN YOU CONCENTRATE YOU FORM LITTLE NERVOUS HABITS THAT'S WHAT HAPPENED TO SOME OF THE CUBS IN TEACHER JANE'S CLASS
YOU JUST NEED A LITTLE HELP THAT THAT'S ALL SAID MAMA LET'S PLANT GRAN'S TULIPS WHERE I THINK ABOUT IT OR WHILE I THINK ABOUT IT AND LATER I'LL TALK TO YOUR PAPA HE MAY HAVE SOME IDEAS
THE BITS OF TAPE HELPED SISTER REMEMBER NOT TO NIBBLE BUT THEY ALSO GOT IN THE WAY WHEN SHE TRIED TO DO CERTAIN THINGS
NOT PERFECTLY IT'S HARD TO BREAK A HABIT AND SISTER HAD TO GIVE BACK SOME OF THOSE PENNIES BUT IN TEN DAYS SHE HAD NINETY THREE PENNIES
THE NEXT MORNING WHEN SISTER LINED UP FOR SCHOOL LIZZY BRUIN AND SOME OTHERS BEGAN POINTING AND TEASING
NEXT HAD COME KINDERGARTEN THAT WAS FUN TOO THERE WERE MARCHING GAMES AND RHYTHM BAND SHE ALSO LEARNED A LOT OF NUMBERS IN KINDERGARTEN AND MOST OF THE ALPHABET
AND IT KEEPS GETTING DEEPER EVERY TIME I USE IT WHY IS IT SO DEEP THAT I CAN'T GET OUT OF IT WITH A LITTLE HELP
OH DEAR SAID MAMA BEAR TO SISTER WHEN THE CUBS GOT HOME FROM SCHOOL ONE DAY
WHAT YOU HAVE WHAT HAVE YOU TRIED SO FAR UHM UH HUH WELL I THINK YOU'RE ON THE RIGHT TRACK WITH THE DIME BUT INSTEAD OF A DIME AND INSTEAD OF GIVING IT TO HER AT THE END OF THE DAY
OH YOU'RE VERY WELCOME MY DEAR SAID GRAN WHEN MAMA CALLED AND HOW IS EVERYTHING AT YOUR HOUSE IS THAT SO YOU KNOW I WAS A NAIL BITER WHEN I WAS A CUB AND MY MAMA HELPED ME TO STOP
PHEW SAID PAPA BEAR I'M GLAD THAT'S OVER YES INDEED AGREED MAMA
THAT'S JUST MY OPINION THOUGH
CAN I GET A DOG PLEASE
PLUS I FORGOT TO TELL YOU THAT UHM THAT YOU SHOULD BE BALAN BALANCE

FINE OSCAR CAN'T REALLY TALK BUT IF HE COULD HE WOULD SAVE HE WOULD HAVE SAID PLEASE SHAVE THE CAT IT IT KEEPS HITTING ME ON THE SHELL AND TRYING TO ROLL ME OVER WHEN YOU LEAVE THE ROOM YOU GUYS NEVER L UH LI UHM LIKED OSCAR AS MUCH AS THE CAT ANYWAY
I WOULD LIKE TO START BY SAYING THAT I THINK THAT YOU ARE VERY MEAN TO MAKE ME DO THIS BECAUSE
THAT BY ACCIDENT TURNED ON THE NOSE HAIR CLIPPER AND THE CAT WAS BEING CHASED BY
UHM YEAH BESIDES THE REAL REASON I SHAVED THE CAT WAS TO KEEP IT NICE AND COOL
AND AND YOU TOLD US WE COU HE COULD HE COULD HIT ANIMALS
THE HOW TO LIS LISTEN SO SHE JUST IGNORED ME SHE UHM SEE SHE'S NOT SO RESPONSIBLE AFTER ALL
RE
TATTLE'TALE
I SWEAR THAT'S THE REASON AL ALSO I WAS GOING TO SELL THE CAT
I UH I KNOW HOW MUCH YOU HATE YOU HATE HIM ALWAYS SNEEZING AND STUFF SO I THOUGHT IF I GOT RID OF HIS FUR HE WOULDN'T SNEEZE AND THAT AND THAT
THEY JUST RAN ON THE STUPID WHEEL AND D AND DID AND DID STUPID THINGS LIKE THE LAST TIME I SHAVED THE CAT TO PRO PROTECT ANY STUPID GERBILS
I WAS UHM AFRAID YOU WOULDN'T LET ME PRACTICE ON MY
A LOT OF A BUNCH OF TIMES HER HAIR WOULD GROW BACK HARDER EACH TIME
H UHM S HER A IF YOU IF YOU M IF PS
SHOULDN'T TEACH THE CAT TO SHAVE ITSELF
S UHM DEAR MOM AND DAD PARENTS
I'LL BET YOU DIDN'T KNOW SOMETHING ELSE
NOT N NOT THAT I SHAVED THE CAT THOUGH
THEN SHE WOULD BE A BE A SUPER CAT AND UHM AND YOU AND YOU COULD TAKE HER ON TV SHOWS
THE RELEASE THE
AND GET LOTS OF MONEY SO THAT YOU CAN SEND JENNY TO COL TO COL TO COLLEGE EVEN IF SHE'S A DUMB LITTLE
I SAW THAT THE CAT WAS TRYING TO GET THE GE
SHE MADE US SHAVE SOMETHING FOR SCIENCE ASK HER SHE SAID THAT WHEN WE SHAVED
CATS DON'T OVERHEAR HEARD
THE CAT WAS BEING CHA UHM CHASED BY THE THE TURTLE AND RAN RIGHT BY THE CLIPPERS AND SHAVED HERSELF I KEPT I KEPT SAYING NO NO KITTY NO DON'T SHAVE YOURSELF
THEY THEY ARE CALLED HAIRLESS CATS
UHM I DON'T
OH SURE IT'S EASY TO SAY THAT I SHOULD HAVE JUST PICKED THE CAT UP BUT
SO I THOUGHT THAT IF I COULD SHAVE SHAVE THE CAT I UHM A A LOT OF A
AS YOU ALWAYS SAY AND NOT BRUSHING HER TEETH
CAT'S AREN'T AREN'T ALWAYS NICE JUST LIKE MY SISTER JENNY J UHM JUST LIKE MY SISTER JENNY ISN'T ALWAYS NICE

UHM THE CAT WAS BEING CHASED BY
THIS AND POOR KITTY THAT
WE COULDN'T HIT H WE COULDN'T ANIMALS SO I DON'T KNOW WHAT ELSE TO DO SO I GRABBED DAD'S NOSE HAIR CLIPPERS CLIPPERS AND SHAVED IT
THE REALEST REASON THE REALEST REASON I SHAVED THE CAT WAS TO MAKE A WIG FOR THOSE POOR HAIR LESS CATS
JUST CAUSE SHE'S A GOOD STUDENT DOESN'T MEAN SHE'S REALLY RESPONSIBLE LAST NIGHT I SAW THAT SHE DIDN'T BRUSH HER TEETH OH YEAH I FORGOT TO TELL YOU THAT
UHM AND THAT YOU WOULD HAVE A BETTER MARRIAGE SO IF SO IT WAS REALLY MY FATHER'S DAY GIFT TO HIM I COULDN'T BUY HIM ANYTHING NICE SINCE YOU TOOK AWAY MY ALLOWANCE FOR WHEN I SHAVED THE
CAT'S FUR AND BUY MY SISTER JENNY BRACES FOR HER BIG STUPID FACE
PRACTICE ON MY ON MY OWN HEAD CAN I PRACTICE BY SHAVING JENNY'S HAIR
AND SOMETIMES EVEN DARKER
THE BEST BESTER BE THE BETTER I'LL DO A BETTER JOB THEN I DID ON THE CAT BECAUSE NOW I HAVE WHAT DAD CALLS LIFE EXPERIENCE
OUR OUR OF CAT FUR ARMOR
OKAY HERE'S WHAT HAPPENED AS I REMEMBER IT
THE ONLY REASON IT HASN'T COME OUT FOR TWO WEEKS IS BECAUSE YOU GUYS MADE SUCH A BIG DEAL ABOUT IT
BLAMING MRS MISTER CASPER MY SCIENCE MY SCIENCE TEACHER
THE NEIGHBOR'S DOG HOW COME JENNY GETS A CAT
W OUR I KNEW OUR CAT WOULD GROW HER FUR HER FUR BACK BUT SOME CATS DON'T HAVE FUR
DEAR MOM DON'T LET DAD KNOW THAT THE REAL REASON I SHAVED THE CAT WAS THAT HE'S ALWAYS SNEEZING AROUND IT
YOU WOULDN'T ALWAYS TAKE THE CAT IN YOU WOULDN'T ALWAYS TAKE THE CAT'S SIDE IF YOU KNEW THE THE STUFF HE DID TO TO TO MY POOR TURTLE
I JUST DIDN'T WANT TO BE THE CAT
IF I HAD A A CAT I WOULD TEACH TEACH IT TO NOT SHAVE ITSELF THAT'S FOR SURE I DON'T HAVE TO I DON'T HAVE TO GET GOOD GRADES TO KNOW THAT THE
PLUS OSCAR PLUS O PLUS OSCAR
SHE'S SO GOOD AT SCHOOL YOU A THAT SHE'S SO GOOD AT SCHOOL AND UHM AND YOU BOUGHT HER A CAT CAUSE SHE'S SO RESPONSIBLE AND STUFF

IF YOU WOULD HAVE UHM HAVE BOUGHT HER A TURTLE I COULD I COULDN'T HAVE SHAVED IT SINCERELY DAN
SINCE YOU HAVE GAR UHM GAR GARD GARDENED ME AND TOLD ME TO WRITE DOWN WHY I AM SORRY BEFORE I WAS ALLOWED OUT OF MY ROOM I AM MAD AT I AM MAD AT YOU
DID YOU KNOW UHM THAT I WANTED TO BE A BARBER
ACTUALLY THE TR THE TRUTH IS THAT I I
POOR KITTY THIS
BUT MY STUPID SISTER NEVER TAUGHT HER CAT HOW TO LIS UHM LIS LISTEN TO
AND I GET A STUPID TURTLE ANYWAY TURTLES DON'T DO ANYTHING EXCEPT
SOMETIMES WE DON'T ALWAYS THINK WE DON'T ALWAYS TH THINK ALL THAT GREAT UNDER PRESSURE AND YOU KNOW WHAT THOSE STUPID GERBILS DIDN'T EVEN TH UHM THANK ME
I WAS AFRAID TO TELL YOU THE REAL REASON I SHAVED THE CAT WAS THAT I WANT TO BE A BARBER AND I NEEDED PRACTICE
AND THEY NEED UHM FUR IN THE WINTER SOMETIMES I THINK
BUT THE THE REAL THE REALEST
PS IF YOU WANT IF YOU WON'T HAVE BOUGHT HER A TURTLE IT WHAT IF YOU WOULDN'T HAVE BOUGHT HER
IT WAS AN AC AC IT WAS AN ACCIDENT AND I DIDN'T EVEN DO DO IT ON PURPOSE I REALLY
ENOUGH THE CAT LIKES BEING SHAVED ALWAY ANYWAY SO I DON'T I DON'T SEE THE BIG IDE IDEA
I JUST DIDN'T WANT TO I JUST DIDN'T WANT TO SEE THE CAT GETTING ALL HOT AND UNCOMFORTABLE AND STUFF
THE FOR WHEN I SHAVED THE NIGHT THE
I KNOW OUR CAT WOULD GROW HER
P PLUS OSCAR MY TURTLE TOLD ME TO SHAVE THE CAT
UHM THAT NO TO KNOW THAT YOU SHOULD TEACH YOU SHOULD TEACH A CAT TO SHAVE ITSELF
DEAR MOM AND DAD JENNY DIDN'T BRUSH HER TEETH LAST NIGHT I THINK THAT SHE SHOULD BRUSH HER TEETH TWICE TONIGHT
UHM THAT WE SAW ON TV ON THE ANIMAL CHANNEL
CUDDLY
IT GROWS BACK HARDER
I PROM PROMISED THAT I'LL DO THE
AND
BAMBOO IS VERY UH VERY WORKABLE SUBSTANCE
I SEE FRED
SUCH NONSENSE GOING TO THE MOON S SAID HER MOTHER POO POO
AFTER ALL IT'S THE ONLY HOME YOU KNOW BESIDES IF YOU LEAVE I'LL GET TERRIBLY OUT OF SHAPE
I'VE NEVER SEEN ANYTHING LIKE IT
THEY WERE IN ORDER OF CUTENESS YIN YIN THE YOUNG DAUGHTER POO POO THE MOTHER AND MOO MOO MAN MOO MAN THE GENTLE ALWAYS SLEEPY FATHER
ONE MORNING ONE MORE THING SIR ABOUT THOSE MAGPIES FLYING ABOVE THE PANDAS DO YOU THINK THAT THE ZOO COULD PURCHASE A LARGE SI ME A LARGE SIZED UMBRELLA
SO ALL THE OTHER PEOPLE AT THE ZOO WOULD KNOW THAT THE PANDAS HAD JUST BEEN FED WHEN THEY SAW FRED HUGGING A RATHER UN CUDDLY PALM TREE OUTSIDE THE PANDA'S HOME
KNEW WHAT KNEW WHAT
THE ZOO KEEPER SAID GOOD HEAVENS MAN THAT IS A GREAT IDEA
YES BUT HOW MANY MORE I'M NOT SURE EXACTLY REPLIED MAGGIE
HE DIDN'T MIND HANDLING THE RAW MEAT HE HAD TO FEED THE TO THE TIGERS HIS MAIN OBJECTION WAS BEING EATEN
HOW TO TURN YOUR HEAD ALL THE WAY AROUND
MAGGIE FIGURED IF SHE AND THREE OF THE HER STRONGEST MAGPIE FRIEND WERE TO EACH GRAB HOLD OF ONE CORNER OF THE ROCKET SHIP THEY COULD FLY TO THE MOON SO THEY TRIED
A LOT OF IT A LOT OF BAMBOO CAN GET QUITE HEAVY SO BECAUSE OF THE PANDAS FRED BECAME A VERY BECAME VERY STRONG AND WAS IN TERRIFIC SHAPE
WHY DID THE A PANDA WITH TH THE BEAUTIFUL GIRL YIN YIN HAVE HER NAME CHANGED TO THE VERY UN BEAUTIFUL GIRL NAME COLUMBUS
YIN YIN'S AND HER BEST FRIEND MAGGIE THE MAGPIE WHO LOOKED A LOT LIKE A PANDA WOULD LOOK IF
EAT BAMBOO PANDAS EAT BAMBOO
I'M SORRY TO SAY BUT MANY LITTLE BOY'S CHEEKS HAVE BEEN MADE RAW WHEN MOTHER POO POO PANDA WAS UPSET
THIS CAN ALMOST CERTAINLY BE ACCOUNTED FOR BY THIS STRANGE ALMOST MAGICAL EFFECT THAT THE PANDA POSSESS
A WEEK LATER M MAGGIE MANAGED TO ROUND UP TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND AND SEVENTY EIGHT MAGPIES
QUICKER WAY TO GET AROUND EUROPE IN ORDER TO IMPROVE TRADE HE WANTED TO BE A BUSINESS MAN BUT INSTEAD HE BECAME A GREAT EXPLORER
FRED WAS NOT ALLOWED TO ACTUALLY HUG THE PANDAS
OH WISE OWL I HAVE A QUESTION THAT I FEAR Y ONLY YOU CAN ANSWER
T'WOULDN'T BE BEST TO FLY
ONE DAY AFTER FRED HAD FED THE PANDAS A
AND PANDAS TEND TO HANDLE BAMBOO A LOT SO THIS IN ITSELF WAS NOT SO ASTONISHING
BUT HE WAS SUPPORTIVE OF HIS DAUGHTER AND SHOWED HIS SUPPORT BY TAKING A NAP
AN INSTANT LATER
BUT YIN YIN THE YOUNG PANDA WAS NOT LISTENING TO FRED SHE WAS TALKING TO HER BEST FRIEND MAGGIE THE MAGPIE ABOUT GOING TO THE MOON
MANY PEOPLE KNOW THE PANDAS
BACK IN THE PANDA'S F HOME THE MOTHER PANDA POO POO WAS VERY PROUD OF HER DAUGHTER
THE OWL INSTANTLY REPLIED TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND SEVENTY SIX GIVE OR TAKE TWO
THEY WERE TALKING ABOUT SINCE THEY HADN'T TAUGHT THOUGHT OR TALKED MUCH ELSE SINCE YIN YIN SAID I WANT TO GO THERE AND POINTED TO THE MOON
WELL SIR WHEN COLUMBUS GOT OUT SET OUT ON HIS SHIP HE WAS REALLY TRYING TO FIND A
T'WOULDN'T IT BE BEST TO ASK OWL THEN HE CLOSED AN EYE
SOME PEOPLE DO NOT LIKE TO BITE THEIR FINGER NAILS BUT FRED WASN'T A NAIL BITER
ACTUALLY IT WAS EIGHTY FIVE POINT FIVE DEGREE SPOT WHERE O SPOT ON HIS KIDNEY BUT THE POINT IS THAT HE WAS VERY FOND OF FEEDING THE PON PANDAS
WITHOUT GETTING A TERRIBLE PAIN IN YOUR NECK O SAID OWL
I SEE YOUR WINGS FLAPPING BUT I DON'T SEE THEM GOING ANYWHERE SAID YIN YIN
THE OTHER REASON WAS THAT ANYONE WHO GETS WITHIN THREE FEET OF THE PANDA AUTOMATICALLY FALLS IN LOVE WITH THEM
FRED FED THE PANDA BEARS THE TIGERS THE TURTLES AND THE TURTLES
A WEEK LATER DESPITE MUCH FLAPPING THEY WERE STILL TRYING TO GET THE ROCKET INTO THE AIR
ONE MORNING FRED WAS FEEDING YIN YIN AND SAID Y OH YIN YIN I WISH I W THAT MORE PEOPLE WOULD COME VISIT THE ZOO
DID YOU KNOW THAT SINCE THE LITTLE PANDA C BUILT THE BAMBOO ROCKET SHIP AND THOSE MAGPIES STARTED FLUTTERING ABOUT THAT THE ZOO'S PROFITS HAVE GONE UP FOUR THOUSAND PERCENT
BUT LATER WHEN FRED WALKED INTO THE PANDA'S HOME UNDER HIS NEW YELLOW UMBRELLA UMBRELLA SHE COULD THINK ONLY TO SAY NONSENSE
BUT EVERYTHING WAS NOT ALL BAMBOO AND HUGS AT THE ZOO
YES BUT WHY DOES THAT HAVE TO DO WITH YIN WITH THE PANDA'S NAME A SAID THE ZOO MANAGER
YOUR JOB IS TO BE CUTE SO PEOPLE WANT TO RUN TO THE GIFT SHOP AND BUY PANDA BEAR DOLLS
I THINK THE ZOO NEED IS A GREAT ADVERTISING CAMPAIGN CAMPAIGN
IS GOING ON
YIN YIN'S FATHER MOO MAN DIDN'T THINK IT WAS VERY PROPER OR WISE FOR A YOUNG PANDA BEAR TO GO ROLLING OFF TO PLACES WHERE SHE THERE WASN'T ANY BAMBOO
SHE SAID SPITEFULLY
NOW IF YOU YOU'LL EXCUSE ME I NEED TO SQUEEZE SOMETHING BEFORE I SCREAM
IT'S TAKEN ME A COUPLE OF WEEKS TO FIGURE IT OUT BUT I THINK
WOULD BE NEEDED TO FLY A FOUR HUNDRED POUND PANDA BEAR AND A ONE HUNDRED POUND BAMBOO ROCKET SHIP TO THE MOON
THE ZOO MANAGER LAUGHED AND WALKED AWAY BUT HE BUT DID PURCHASE A FASHIONABLE YELLOW UMBRELLA FOR FRED THE NEXT DAY
AT FURTHER DISTANCES PANDAS HAVE A STRANGE ALMOST MAGICAL EFFECT
THE FATHER WATCHING THIS ALL THROUGH ONE EYE FOR HE ALWAYS HAD AT LEAST ONE EYE ASLEEP AT ALL TIMES SAID
NO WAIT A SECOND I DON'T UNDERSTAND
AND YOUR FAMILY TO THE BIG ZOO IN SAN ANGELES AN THAT'S SAN ANGELES OKAY UHM IF WE DON'T GET ENOUGH MONEY
NOW WHILE ALL THIS WAS GOING ON WHAT DO YOU SUPPOSE FRED WAS DOING
NO ONE COULD BLAME FRED REALLY SINCE NO ONE REALLY WANTS TO BE EATEN
WHEN IT CAME TO THE PANDAS HE HAD A WARM SPOT IN HIS HEART
BEARS SINCE
ONE TWO THREE TO THE MOON THEY SAID TOGETHER PULLING WITH ALL THEIR MIGHT
BUT PHYSICAL FITNESS WAS NOT THE ONLY REASON FRED LOVED THE PANDAS
IT WAS FRED'S IDEA SO LET''S BEGIN WITH FRED
YIN YIN WAS ALWAYS THE ONE TO TAKE GOOD ADVICE FROM HER FATHER
OH WELL THAT MAKES SENSE THEN
SHE COULD BE BE VERY PERSUASIVE A VERY PERSUASIVE LITTLE BIRD WHEN SHE WANTED
I'VE BECOMING VERY GOOD AT IT I DON'T THINK IT WILL TAKE THAT LONG TO ROLL THERE SAID YIN YIN
THEY WOULD HAVE TO MOVE FROM THEIR WONDERFUL HOME
WHAT SORT OF NONSENSE IS THIS FOR A YOUNG PANDA BEAR GOING TO THE MOON INDEED NONSENSE
SELLING ENOUGH STUFFED PANDA BEARS IT'S JUST THAT WE THAT THERE HAVEN'T BEEN ENOUGH PEOPLE COMING TO THE ZOO
NONSENSE SAID THE MOTHER I'M SO MAD I'M GONNA GOING TO
FOR FRED
THE MAIN OBSTACLE IT TURNS OUT WAS GETTING THE ROCKET SHIP OFF THE GROUND
THE PANDA
AT LEAST TO THE YIN YIN'S PARENTS FRED SURE WAS IMPRESSED THOUGH
A YOUNG BOY WAS HEARD SAYING OW MOM CUT THAT OUT
YES THE BIG ONE IN THE SKY THAT IS MOST LIKELY TO NOT BE MADE OF CHEESE AND MOST CERTAINLY NOT MADE OUT OF BAMBOO
YIN YIN WANTS TO GO TO THE MOON AND THE MAGPIE WANTS TO TAKE HER THERE
BUT I JUST LEARNED HOW TO MAKE MYSELF INTO A BALL AND ROLL TWO DAYS AGO
AFTER ALL IF IT WEREN'T FOR YIN YIN
ON HUMAN BEINGS WHICH MAKES US WANT TO HUG AND SQUEEZE THINGS
SO MAGGIE FLEW TO OWL AND ASKED FOR ADVICE
ENOUGH OF THIS NONSENSE SAID YIN YIN'S MOTHER POO POO
IT'S NOT THAT YOU AREN'T S COMING
WHY HE WAS FEEDING THE PANDAS LIKE HE WAS SUPPOSED TO
SO BEING EATEN WAS DEFINITELY NOT SOMETHING HE LOOKED FORWARD TO EACH AFTERNOON AT THREE O'CLOCK WHEN IT WAS TIME TO FEED THE TIGERS
THERE WERE THREE PANDAS AND THEY WERE KNOWN AS PAN THE PAN FAMILY
SO BEFORE HE RAN OFF TO HUG A PALM TREE HE QUICKLY SAID IT COSTS MORE SO MUCH TO FEED YOU PANDA BEARS I WOULD HATE IF YOU HAD TO LEAVE US
AFTER FRED FED THE PANDAS H AND HE WAS HUGGING A PALM TREE THE ZOO MANAGER CAME UP TO HIM AND SAID WHAT'S GOING ON WITH YOUR PANDA FRED
THAT COULD BE DANGEROUS
NO HOW MANY MAGPIES WOULD IT
IT'S THE LAW OF NATURE
HMM HEAVIER THAN I THOUGHT I THINK WE'LL NEED MORE MAGPIES
FRED THOUGHT ABOUT IT AND SAID YOU KNOW I THINK WE SHOULD RENAME YIN YIN COLUMBUS
I KNOW I SHOULDN'T BE TELLING YOU THIS WE MIGHT BE ABLE TO SELL BUT WE MIGHT HAVE TO SELL YOU
IT TURNS OUT THAT THE OWL DIDN'T TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION THAT ONCE YOU GET OVER ONE THOUSAND MAGPIES TOGETHER THEY TEND TO FIGHT AND CAN'T AGREE ON A SINGLE THING
THE TURTLES WEREN'T SO BAD BUT AS FOR THE TIGERS HE WASN'T SO SURE
AND LESS THAN A WEEK LATER YIN YIN AND MAGGIE HAD BUILT A ROCKET SHIP OUT OF BAMBOO
THIS IS JUST THE TYPE OF EXPOSURE WE NEEDED THOSE PANDAS WILL BE WITH US FOR A LONG TIME
HER MOTHER AND FATHER KNEW WHAT
AS FOR YIN YIN SHE WAS VERY PROUD TO BE RENAMED AFTER A FAMOUS EXPLORER AND SHE SHE AND THE MAGPIE MAGGIE NEVER STOPPED TRYING TO GET TO THE MOON
WELL IT SEEMS TO ME SIR YIN YIN WANTED TO BE A GREAT EX EXPLORER BUT INSTEAD BECAME A BUSINESS WOMAN
IT'S SIMPLE ECONOMICS LIKE IT OR NOT WE ARE SPOKESPEOPLE FOR PANDAS FOR PANDA STUFFED ANIMALS INDUSTRY WHICH YOUNG LADY HELPS PAY FOR THE BAMBOO YOU EAT
LOOK AT THAT YOUNG THAT LADY OVER THE THERE AND MAKE HER WANT TO SQUEEZE HER SONS CHEEKS
POOR KITTY THIS IS THIS AND POOR KITTY THAT IT'S YOUR FAULT REALLY DAD PLEASE DON'T READ THE NEXT PART
I I KNEW OUR CAT WOULD GROW HER FUR BACK BUT SOME CATS DON'T HAVE HAIR THEY'RE CALLED HAIRLESS CATS THEY NEED FUR IN THE WINTER SOMETIMES I THINK
SO I GRABBED DAD GRABBED DAD'S NOSE HAIRS CLIPPERS AND SHAVED IT
I WAS AFRAID TO TELL YOU THE REAL THE REAL REASON I SHAVED THE CAT WAS THAT I WANT TO BE A BARBER AND I NEEDED PRACTICE
A AND SO WHAT IF IT'S WINTER BUT I MEAN I MEAN IT'LL BE SUMMER SOON ENOUGH SOON ENOUGH AND I'LL AND I JUST WANTED THE CAT TO GET USED TO THE IDEA BEFORE IT GOT REALLY HOT PLUS OSCAR MY TURTLE TOLD ME TO SHAVE THE CAT
SINCE YOU HAVE GROUNDED ME AND TOLD ME TO WRITE DOWN WHY I'M I AM SORRY BEFORE I WAS ALLOWED OUT OF MY ROOM I AM MAD AT YOU
JUST CAUSE SHE'S A GOOD STUDENT DOESN'T MEAN SHE'S REALLY RESPONSIBLE
HOW COME JENNY GETS A CAT AND I GET A STUPID TURTLE ANYWAY TURTLES DON'T DO ANYTHING EXCEPT FOR POKE THEIR HEADS OUT AND NOT BE CUDDLY
THEN SHE WOULD BE A SUPER CAT AND YOU COULD TELL AND YOU COULD TAKE HER ON TV SHOWS AND GET LOTS OF MONEY SO THAT YOU CAN SEND JENNY HER CAT BECAUSE SHE'S SO RESPONSIBLE AND STUFF
I KEPT SAYING NO KITTY DON'T NO DON'T SHAVE YOURSELF BUT THE ST MY STUPID SISTER NEVER TAUGHT HER CAT HOW TO LISTEN SO SHE JUST IGNORED ME
I KNOW HOW MUCH YOU HATE HIM ALWAYS SNEEZING AND STUFF SO I THOUGHT IF I GET RID OF ITS FUR HE WOULDN'T SNEEZE AND THAT YOU WOULD HAVE A BETTER MARRIAGE SO THAT'S REALLY WHY MY FATHER'S DAY GIFT TO HIM
PLUS I FORGOT TO TELL YOU THAT YOU SHOULD BE BLAMING MRS CASPER MY SCIENCE TEACHER SHE MADE US SHAVE SOMETHING FOR SCIENCE ASK HER SHE SAID THAT WHEN WE SHAVE HAIR IT GROWS BACK HARDER AND SOMETIMES EVEN DARKER
AND DO YOU KNOW WHAT THOSE STUPID GERBILS DIDN'T EVEN THANK ME THEY JUST RAN ON THAT STUPID WHEEL AND DID STUPID THINGS THAT'S THAT'S THE LAST TIME I SHAVE THE CAT TO PROTECT MY ANY STUPID GERBILS
I PROMISE I'LL THAT I'LL DO A BETTER JOB THEN I DID ON THE CAT BECAUSE NOW I HA NOW I HAVE WHAT DAD CALLS LIFE EXPERIENCE THAT'S NOT THAT'S N THAT'S NOT I SHAVED THE CAT THOUGH
PLUS IF YOU WEREN'T ALWAYS CUDDLING WITH MY SISTER SO MUCH MAYBE SHE WOULD HAVE BEEN SHE WOULD HAVE BEEN WITH HER CAT INSTEAD THE CAT CAME INTO MY ROOM BECAUSE JENNY NEVER PLAYS WITH IT ENOUGH
YOU WOULDN'T YOU WOULDN'T ALWAYS TAKE THE CAT CAT'S SIDE IF YOU KNEW THE STUFF HE DID TO MY POOR TURTLE CAT'S AREN'T ALWAYS NICE IT JUST JUST LIKE MY SISTER JENNY ISN'T ALWAYS NICE
I REALLY DIDN'T MEAN TO SHAVE THAT CAT SHAVE THE CAT REALLY I SWEAR OK HERE'S WHAT HAPPENED AS I REMEMBER IT
DEAR MOM AND DAD JENNY DIDN'T BRUSH HER TEETH LAST NIGHT
PS IF YOU REALLY IF YOU COULD HAVE BOUGHT HER A TURTLE I WOULDN'T SHAVED IT SIN SINCERELY DANNY
DEAR MOM DON'T LET DAD KNOW THE REAL REASON I SHAVED THE CAT HE'S ALWAYS SNEEZING AROUND IT
I SWEAR THAT'S THE REASON ALSO I WAS G GOING TO SELL THE CAT THE CAT FUR AND BUY MY SISTER JENNY BRACES FOR HER F BIG STUPID FACE
YOU YOU YOU SHOULD BE PROUD OF ME FOR THINKING SOMETIMES WHY WE SHOULDN'T ALWAYS THINK THAT ALL THAT THAT THAT THINK ALL THAT GREAT UNDER PRESSURE
IT WAS AF I WAS AFRAID YOU WOULDN'T LET ME PRACTICE ON MY OWN HEAD CAN I PRACTICE SHA BY SHAVING JENNY'S HEAD
I I KNOW I I DID I DON'T HAVE TO GET GOOD GRADES TO KNOW WHAT YOU SHOULD TEACH A CAT TO SHAVE ITSELF
FINE OSCAR CAN'T REALLY TALK BUT IF HE COULD HE WOULD HAVE SAID PLEASE SHAVE THE CAT IT KEEPS HITTING ME ON THE SHELL AND TRYING TO ROLL ME OVER WHEN YOU LEAVE ME IN WHEN YOU LEAVE THE ROOM YOU GUYS NEVER LIKED OSCAR AS MUCH AS THE CAT ANYWAY
I WOULD LIKE TO START BY SAYING THAT I THINK YOU ARE VERY MEAN TO MAKE ME DO THIS BECAUSE IT WASN'T EVEN MY FAULT I COULDN'T HELP IT ANYWAY IT WAS AN ACCIDENT AND I DIDN'T EVEN DO IT ON PURPOSE
J LAST NIGHT I SAW SHE DIDN'T EVEN BRUSH HER TEETH OH YEAH I FORGOT TO TELL YOU THAT
CAN I GET A DOG PLEASE SO IN CONCLUSION I'M GETTING HUNGRY AND I'M SORRY FOR SHAVING THE CAT ALTHOUGH YOU CAN SEE THAT IT'S REALLY JENNY'S FAULT FOR NOT BEING RESPONSIBLE AS YOU CAN SAY AS YOU CAN ALWAYS SAY AND NOT BRUSHING HER TEETH
SEE SHE'S NOT RESPONSIBLE AFTER ALL IF I HAD A CAT I WOULD TEACH IT TO TO NOT TO NOT SHAVE ITSELF THAT'S FOR SURE
YOU GUYS WILL PROBABLY JUST SAY IT'S WINTER DANNY CATS DON'T OVERHEAT IN THE WINTER
DEAR MOM AND DAD PARENTS
I COULDN'T I COULDN'T BUY HIM ANYTHING NICE SINCE YOU TOOK AWAY MY ALLOWANCE FOR WHEN I SHAVED THE NEIGHBOR'S DOG
SO I THOUGHT IF I WOULD SH SHOULD COULD SHAVE THE CAT A LOT A LOT A BUNCH OF TIMES HER HAIR WOULD GROW BACK HARDER EACH TIME AND SHE WOULD SOON SHE WOULD BE AN INVINCIBLE COAT OF CAT FUR ARMOR
BESIDES THE REAL REASON I I SHAVED THE CAT WAS TO KEEP IT NICE AND COOL I DIDN'T WANT THE T TO SEE THE CAT GETTING ALL HOT AND UNCOMFORTABLE AND STUFF
ACTUALLY THE TRUTH IS THAT I BY ACCIDENT TURNED ON THE NOSE HAIR CLIPPERS AND THE CAT WAS BEING CHASED BY THE TURTLE AND RAN RIGHT BY THE CLIPPERS AND SHAVED HERSELF
THE CAT LIKED BEING SHAVED ANYWAY SO I DON'T SEE THE BIG DEAL I I THINK IT REALLY LIKES ITS HAIRCUT THE ONLY REASON IT HASN'T COME OUT FOR TWO WEEKS IS BECAUSE YOU GUYS MADE SUCH A BIG DEAL ABOUT IT
THE REALEST REASON I SHAVED THE CAT WAS TO MAKE A BIG WING A WING FOR THE THOSE POOR HAIR LESS CATS THAT WE SAW ON TV ON THE ANIMAL CHANNEL
I SAW THE CAT WAS TRYING I SAW THAT THE CAT WAS TRYING TO GET THE GERBILS SO YOU AND YOU TOLD US WE COULDN'T HIT THE ANIMALS SO I WOULDN'T DIDN'T KNOW WHAT ELSE TO DO
I THINK SH THAT SHE SHOULD BRUSH HER TEETH TWICE TONIGHT THAT'S MY OPINION THOUGH I TH I BET YOU DIDN'T KNOW SOMETHING ELSE DID DID YOU KNOW THAT I WANTED TO BE A BARBER
THE FLIES HATE
SO THEY DECIDED THAT
THEN HE PLAYED THE SONG FOR POLICE CHIEF SANDERS
BECAUSE AS BAD AS THE FLUTE SOUNDED
EVERYBODY LOOKED REALLY SILLY AT DANCES
FLIES ANYMORE
BE
THEY HAD TO COVER THEIR EARS FROM THE HORRIBLE SOUND
HE PLAYED MANY MUSICAL INSTRUMENTS
A A BIG BAND PLAYED AS THEY MARCHED UP AND DOWN THE STREET
TH WHY DID THEY EVER INVENT EARS
BUT I FEEL LIKE I HAVE TO DO HAVE TO OR ELSE BAD THINGS WILL HAPPEN
BUT SOON AFTER THAT THEY STARTED TO GET FLIES
WHY CAN'T
ON A BIG GIRL
STILL IT'S NOT AS BAD AS MILLIONS OF FLIES I SUPPOSE
AND GUESS WHAT
THE POLICE CHIEF HATED THE SOUND SO MUCH THAT HE THREW JOHN IN JAIL
OH WELL GOOD THING I BROUGHT MY OLD FLUTE AS A BACK UP
AND NO FLUTE PROBLEM
PEOPLE W WOULD RUN AWAY SCREAMING
YOU SHOULD KNOW A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE TOWN OF FRANKSVILLE
DOCTOR WONG CAME UP WITH AN IDEA
THAT'S HOW
WHAT SHOULD THEY DO
THE FLIES FLEW AWAY AS FAST AS THEY COULD
THE WAY HIS THE WAY HIS MOUTH WAS SHAPED
THEN ANOTHER
AND THEN MULTIPLY THAT TIMES A HUNDRED
WHERE DOWN WHERE NO ONE COULD HEAR HIM JOHN THOUGHT THAT WAS AN OKAY IDEA
SAID POLICE CHIEF SANDERS
SO HE WOULD SWAT AT AT THEM WITH HIS HAND OR EVEN HIS NEW FLUTE
WELL I'M SURE
IT WAS
THE NEIGHBORS ARE COMPLAINING AND CATS
PRETTY SOON TONS OF FLIES
HE WASN'T CALLED ROOSTER JOHN YET THAT CAME LATER
NO FLY PROBLEM
JOHN IN JAIL SINCE HE WASN'T REALLY BREAKING ANY LAWS SO THERE WAS NOTHING THE POLICE COULD DO
IT WAS TOO LATE
JOHN COULD PLAY THE FLUTE AND EVERYONE ELSE WOULD HAVE
FROM THEN ON
THEY JUST COULDN'T LEAD A NORMAL LIFE
THEN SUDDENLY
THE TUBA THE PIANO AND THE CLARINET
JOHN WOULD WAKE UP AT SUNRISE LIKE A ROOSTER AND PLAY TO KEEP THE FLIES AWAY
MAYBE A POORLY PLAYED FLUTE DOESN'T SOUND ALL THAT BAD
I'VE HEARD YOU PLAY THE CLARINET
TO DO SO HE JUST KEPT ON PLAYING HIS FLUTE
TO WEAR EARPLUGS
JO JOHN THE DENTIST IS DRIVING THE FLIES AWAY
THEN THE FLIES STOPPED
WE CAN'T LET YOU PLAY THE FLUTE ANYMORE JOHN SAID POLICE CHIEF SANDERS
THEN ONE LANDED ON EVERYTHING
THE BAD FLUTE PLAYER WAS ROOSTER JOHN
THE FLUTE SOUNDED NORMAL AND IT TURNED OUT JOHN COULD PLAY IT QUITE WELL
BUT THEY COULDN'T KEEP
NO NO DON'T PLAY YOUR OLD FLUTE
WERE ON THE MAIN FLOAT
HE WAS AN EXCELLENT DENTIST BUT HIS REAL LOVE WAS MUSIC
WHY
BEFORE THEY KNEW IT THE TOWN WAS FILLED WITH FLIES AGAIN
THEIR PROBLEMS STARTED WHEN THEY RAN OUT OF WATER
THAT'S HOW THE FLUTE SOUNDED WHEN THIS GUY PLAYED IT
DOCTOR WONG THOUGHT FOR A SECOND THEN PRONOUNCED
THEY COULD KEEP THEY COULDN'T KEEP JOHN IN JAIL
MADE A FLUTE SOUND AS SO BAD THAT HIS FISH WOULD JUMP OUT OF THEIR FISH BOWL
WOULD HAVE TO TAKE THE GOOD WITH THE BAD
NO ONE COULD HEAR ANYTHING PEOPLE WERE GETTING IN CAR ACCIDENTS AND
WERE LANDING ON EVERYONE
SINCE HE
WHEN THE TOWNSFOLK HEARD THE NOISE THEY COULDN'T EVEN SWAT AT THE F
JOH
AND ALL THE
IT WAS A LOT BETTER THAN THOUSANDS OF FLIES CRAWLING ON THEM
DANCING TO MUSIC THEY COULDN'T HEAR
SINCE HE HAD BECOME THE TOWN DENTIST EVERYBODY'S TEETH WERE MUCH WHITER AND CLEANER AND NOBODY AN
SUCH AS THE GUITAR
EVERYONE CHEERED
NO ONE HAD ANY CAVITIES
THE FLIES WOULD LAND ALL OVER THE PEOPLE AND THEY COULDN'T SWAT THEM OFF IT WAS GROSS
LOOK JOHN
JOHN DIDN'T KNOW WHAT
THEY GOT TONS AND TONS OF FLIES
JOHN'S FLUTE PLAYING AS MUCH AS WE DO
IT WORKED DOCTOR WONG WAS THE TOWN HERO
DOCTOR WONG AND JOHN WERE THE S STARS OF THE PARADE SO THEY
HE WAS THE NEW TOWN DENTIST
THEN OTHER ONE LANDED
FRANKSVILLE WAS A TOWN THAT SEEMED TO HAVE ONE PROBLEM AFTER THE OTHER
HE THOUGHT THAT
THEN W
OH THAT'S A NICE INSTRUMENT BUT IT'S JUST NOT THE FLUTE
HE STARTED SHAKING THE FLUTE TO GET THE FLIES OFF AND ACCIDENTALLY SMASHED IT INTO PIECES
BUT THERE WAS AN ECHO IN THE WELL THAT MADE THE FLUTE SOUND LOUDER
THE CATS AND DOGS ARE TRYING TO CHEW OFF THEIR EARS
YOU GUESSED THAT DIDN'T WORK
THEN WHEN THE PEOPLE OF FRANKSVILLE REALIZED THAT THEY
BESIDES EVERYBODY LOVED JOHN
JOHN HAD STARTED PLAYING
WHO PLAYED THE FLUTE SO BADLY THAT
BEFORE I TELL YOU HOW ROOSTER JOHN GOT HIS NAME
THE LOCAL SCIENTIST
COWS IN TOWN STARTED TO MAKE SOUR MILK
BUT FOR SOME REASON
SUDDENLY A FLY LANDED ON A LITTLE GIRL
SO THERE WAS A PROBLEM IN THE TOW LITTLE TOWN OF FRANKSVILLE
YOU'RE QUITE GOOD WHY DON'T YOU PLAY THAT INSTEAD
THE FLIES WERE ANNOYING
THEN THEY DECIDED TO LOWER HIM DOWN A WELL AND LET HIM PLAY
BUT JUST TRY TO IMAGINE SOMEONE SCRATCHING A CHALKBOARD WITH A FORK
THEN TWO LANDED ON EVERYONE
BUT JUST THEN A MAN MOVED INTO TOWN
BEGGED TO DOCTOR WONG
THE PEOPLE IN THE TOWN DECIDED TO HAVE A GREAT PARADE IN FRANKSVILLE AND CELEBRATE THE FACT THAT THERE WAS NO WATER PROBLEM
I WAS BORN TO DO IT I DON'T KNOW WHY
OH NO SAID POLICE CHIEF SANDERS JUST WHEN THINGS WERE GOING GOOD FOR FRANKSVILLE
OH TH
THEN OTHER ONE LANDED ON
THANKFULLY SOMEONE WAS DIGGING A HOLE AND FOUND WATER
THEN HE SAID
HE THOUGHT IF HE MADE A NEW MOUTHPIECE ESPECIALLY SHAPED FOR JOHN'S MOUTH PERHAPS HE COULD PLAY THE FLUTE NORMALLY
I'M SERIOUS
IT'S THE FLUTE SOUND
AND THEY DIDN'T WANT TO KICK HIM OUT OF TOWN BECAUSE THEY ALL HAD SUCH NICE TEETH
HE WAS VERY UPSET AT FIRST
I WROTE YOU A SONG ON THE FLUTE IT'S CALLED COPS AND ROBBERS
WINDOWS WERE BREAKING
BUT I HAVE TO PLAY
THE PERSON NEXT TO ME WOULD BE WOULD HAVE BEEN VERY ANNOYED
THE FIRST TIME I EVER TOOK AN AIRPLANE BY MYSELF IT WAS FUN AND SCARY
THEN I COULD BE A PILOT TOO S PILOT TOO SINCE I'M MUCH BETTER AT PUSHING BUTTONS THAT YOU ARE PUSHING BUTTONS THAN YOU ARE
SHE WAS THE ONE WHO KEPT TRYING TO GIVE ME PEANUTS
SHE TOLD ME TO CALL HER JENNIFER INSTEAD
SHE TOLD ME TO BE QUIET AND WATCH THE MOVIE
WHICH MADE ME HAVE TO GO TO THE BATHROOM EIGHT TIMES I WAS GLAD THAT THERE WASN'T ANYONE NEXT TO ME
WE ARE GOING TO CRASH
IMAGINE HOW HARD IT WOULD BE TO WORK ALL THOSE MILLIONS OF BUTTONS AND EAT PEANUTS
IN EVEN
YOU GO HIGHER AND THEN ANY MOUNTAIN HIGHER THAN ANY MOUNTAIN AND YOU GO FASTER THAN ANY CAR
BY MY BACKPACK WAS IN THE OVERHEAD THING THINGY
BUT SOMETIMES PEOPLE LIKE TO EAT PEANUTS ON THEIR BANANA SPLITS
I ONLY USED TO ONLY USED THE GREEN CRAYON BECAUSE IT WAS THE TALLEST AND I WANTED IT TO CATCH UP TO THE RED BROWN BLUE YELLOW PURPLE AND BLACK ONES
I ALSO BROUGHT MY DECK OF CARDS IN CASE THE PILOT WAS BORED AND WANTED TO PLAY GO FISH
GRANDPA LAUGHED AND TOLD AND TOOK ME STRAIGHT TO THE ICE CREAM SHOP
CAN'T GET PAST LEVEL THREE
UHM
I WAS FLYING THERE TO SEE MY GRANDFATHER AND AND WE WERE GOING TO THE GO WE WERE GOING TO GO FISHING
SHE SAID THAT SHE HAD TO HELP OTHER PASSENGERS
MY MOM GAVE ME A COLORING BOOK AND A COOL LOOKING DRAGONS TO KEEP ME BUSY
HE WAS READY REALLY NICE BUT HE WOULDN'T PLAY GO FISH WITH ME
THEN JENNIFER CAME UP TO ME AND SAID SHE HAD A SURPRISE I THOUGHT GREAT I THOUGHT GREAT MORE PEANUTS
WHEN I GOT OFF THE AIRPLANE THERE WERE WAS GRANDPA WAITING FOR ME HE SAID HOW WAS YOUR FLIGHT
THE FLIGHT ATTENDANT GAVE ME A DECK OF CARDS BUT SHE WOULDN'T PLAY GO FISH WITH ME
THE WAY I FIGURED IT MY GAME BOY MY GAME BOY ONLY WAS FIVE BUTTONS AND I
THEN HE TOLD ME THAT HE ONCE PLAYED THE GAME I HAD ON MY GAME BOY AND HE COULDN'T EVEN PASS LEVEL ONE
EVENTUALLY THE FLIGHT FLIGHT ATTENDANT SEEMED TO GET A LITTLE ANNOYED THAT I HAD TO GO TO THE BATHROOM SO MUCH
I GUESS IT WAS BECAUSE THE PLANE WAS S SO LOUD AND I DIDN'T KNOW ANYONE
SO I STARTED YELLING HEY PEANUT LADY HEY PEANUT LADY
ONE THING ABOUT BEING BY YOURSELF ON AN AIRPLANE IS THAT THE FLIGHT ATTENDANTS ARE VERY NICE TO YOU
AT FIRST I THOUGHT WOW LOOK AT ALL THOSE BUTTONS
I DIDN'T KNOW ANYONE AT ALL ALL AND HAD TO GO ALL THE WAY FROM NEW YORK TO TEXAS WITHOUT MY PARENTS
I TOLD HER THAT I WANTED A BANANA SPLIT INSTEAD BUT SHE SAID THEY
BUT ONCE THE PLANE WAS IN THE CAR IN THE AIR I WAS PRETTY GOOD
HE LAUGHED EVEN THOUGH I WAS JOKING HE SAID HE THOUGHT I WOULD MAKE A GREAT PILOT SOMEDAY IF I WANTED TO BE IF I WANTED TO BE
I PLAYED ON MY GAME BOY UNTIL I GOT MY NEW HIGH SCORE
I TRIED TO WATCH THE MOVIE BUT I HAD ALREADY SEEN THAT ONE SO IT WAS BORING
TO EVER STOP BUT IT DOESN'T BUT IT DOES
THE PILOT TOLD ME THAT IT WASN'T REALLY THAT HARD ONCE YOU PRACTICED
I TRIED TO PUSH THE BUTTON THAT LIGHTS UP OVER MY HEAD SO THE FLIGHT ATTENDANT WOULD COME BUT GUESS WHAT I WAS SO SHORT TO REACH THE BUTTON
BUT TO TELL YOUR THE BUT TO TELL YOU THE TRUTH WITHOUT MY PARENTS THERE I WAS PRETTY NERVOUS
I TOLD HER THAT IT WAS THE PEANUTS THAT WERE MAKING ME SO THIRSTY IN THE FIRST PLACE IN THE FIRST PLACE AND THAT
IT SEEMED LIKE THE PLANE IN THE PLANE IS GOING
JENNIFER TOOK ME INTO THE COCKPIT AND THERE WERE A MILLION BUTTONS AND LEVERS AND KNOBS AND STUFF
THAT'S ALWAYS SCARY
IT WAS WORTH THE WHOLE TRIP JUST TO EAT A BANANA SPLIT WITH GRANDPA
I HAD A GAME BOY IN MY BACKPACK
I ALWAYS THOUGHT FLYING WAS FUN
THEY DON'T HAVE ANY BANANA SPLITS ON THE PLANE
SHE SAID THE CAPTAIN WAS INVITING ME TO SEE THE COCKPIT I THOUGHT AWESOME
A COL I COLORED THE DRAGON PICTURES ALL GREEN SO IT DIDN'T TAKE VERY LONG
FINALLY HE LANDED
BUT IT WASN'T PEANUTS IT WAS SOMETHING REALLY COOL
I SAID SOMEDAY I'M GOING TO BE A PILOT AND I'LL ONLY SERVE BANANA SPLITS ON MY PLANE
BUT IT WAS HER FAULT
I SAID IF YOU CAN'T EVEN GET PAST LEVEL ONE AND YOU'RE A PILOT
SHE DIDN'T LIKE BEING CALLED PEANUT LADY BUT SHE DIDN'T GIVE ME MY GAME BOY
I STARTED THINKING HE MIGHT CRASH I DIDN'T LIKE TO THINK ABOUT THAT BUT I COULDN'T HELP IT
AND THAT IF SHE WOULD GET ME A BANANA SPLIT I WOULDN'T I WOULDN'T HAVE TO GO THE BATHROOM SO MUCH
TOO FAST
THEN I THOUGHT THERE'S NO WAY THAT ANYONE CAN REMEMBER TO PUSH ALL THOSE BUTTONS AT THE RIGHT TIME
I HAD SEVEN COCA COL COLAS AND FOUR GINGER GINGER ALES
THAT'S WHEN I MISSED MY PARENTS THE MOST
THE AIRPLANE RIDE
HE WAS EX AN EXCELLENT DENTIST BUT REAL LOVE WAS MUSIC
BEFORE I TELL YOU HOW THE ROOSTER JOHN GOT HIS NAME YOU SHOULD KNOW A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE TOWN FRANKSVILLE
BUT THE TOWN WAS FILLED WITH FLIES AGAIN
NEW TOWN DENTIST
THEN ON JOHN WOULD WAKE UP AT SUNRISE LIKE A ROOSTER AND PLAY TO KEEP THE FLIES AWAY
WELL I'M SURE YOU GUESSED THAT IT DIDN'T WORK SO NO ONE COULD HEAR ANYTHING
OH THAT'S NICE INSTRUMENT BUT THAT'S NOT THE FLUTE
THE FLUTE SOUNDED NORMAL AND IT TURNED OUT JOHN COULD PLAY IT QUITE WELL
THE BAD FLUTE PLAYER WAS ROOSTER JOHN HE WASN'T CALLED ROOSTER JOHN YET
SO THERE WAS NOTHING THE POLICE COULD DO BESIDES EVERYBODY LOVED JOHN SINCE HE HAD BECOME THE TOWN DENTIST EVERYBODY'S TEETH WERE MUCH WHITER AND CLEANER AND NO ONE HAD ANY CAVITIES
THE FLIES WERE ANNOYING SO HE WOULD SWAT THEM WITH HIS HAND OR EVEN A F HIS NEW FLUTE
WE CAN'T LET YOU PLAY WITH THE FLUTE ANYMORE JOHN SAID THE POLICE CHIEF SANDERS
JOHN THOUGHT HE WAS ASK AN OK IDEA BUT THE LOUDER THE ECHO THAT WELL MADE THE FLUTE SOUNDED LOUDER
JOHN DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TO DO SO HE KEPT PLAYING HIS FLUTE
DOCTOR WONG THOUGHT FOR A SECOND THEN PRONOUNCED IT'S THE FLUTE SOUND THE FLIES HATE JOHN'S FLUTE PLAYING HAS MUCH AS WE DO
THAT'S HOW THE FLUTE SOUNDED WHEN IT WHEN THIS GUY PLAYED IT
CHIEF SANDERS I CALLED IT COPS AND ROBBERS
HOWEVER FOR SOME REASON THE WAY HIS MOUTH WAS SHAPED MADE HIS FLUTE SOUND AWFUL
THE PROBLEM STARTED WHEN THEY RAN OUT OF WATER THANKFULLY SOMEONE WAS DIGGING A HOLE AND FOUND
LEAD A NORMAL LI LIFE
OH NO SAID THE CHIEF SANDERS JUST WHEN THINGS WERE GOING GOOD FOR FRANKSVILLE
THE FLIES WOULD LAND ALL OVER THE PEOPLE THEY COULDN'T SWAT THEM OFF IT WAS GROSS
DOCTOR WONG AND JOHN WERE STARS OF THE PARADE
IT WAS PRETTY SOON THERE WERE TONS OF FLIES LANDING ON EVERYONE FOR THEY KNEW IT
THAT CAME LATER HE JUST NEW
BECAUSE AS BAD AS THE FLUTE SOUNDED IT WAS A LOT BETTER THAN THOUSANDS OF FLIES CRAWLING ON THEM FROM
WHAT WOULD THEY DO THEY COULDN'T KEEP JOHN IN JAIL AND THEY COULDN'T WANT TO KICK HIM OUT OF THE TOWN BECAUSE THEY ALL HAD SUCH NICE TEETH
HE WAS VERY UPSET AT FIRST THEN HE SAID OH WELL GOT GOOD THING I BROUGHT MY OLD FLUTE BACK UP
BUT I HAVE TO PLAY I WAS BORN TO DO IT I KNOW WHY BUT I FEEL LIKE I HAVE TO OR ELSE BAD THINGS WILL HAPPEN
THEN THE FLIES STOPPED BUT JUST THEN A MAN MOVED INTO
THOUGH LOCAL DENTIST DOCTOR WRONG CAME UP WITH AN IDEA HE TAUGHT HE THOUGHT THAT IF HE MADE A NEW MOUTHPIECE ESPECIALLY SHAPED FOR JOHN'S MOUTH THEN PERHAPS HE COULD PLAY THE FLUTE NORMALLY
MAYBE A POORLY P PLAYED FLUTE DOESN'T SOUND ALL THAT BAD BUT JUST TRYING TO IMAGE SOMEONE SCREACHING AN A CHALKBOARD WITH A FORK AND THEN MULTIPLY THAT A HUNDRED T TIMES A HUNDRED
HE PLAYED MUSICAL INSTRUMENTS SUCH AS THE GUITAR THE TUBA THE PIANO AND THE CLARINET
FRANKSVILLE WAS A TOWN THAT SEEMED TO HAVE ONE PROBLEM AFTER ANOTHER
PEOPLE WERE GETTING INTO CARS CAR ACCIDENTS AND EVERYBODY LOOKED REALLY SILLY AT DANCES DANCING TO MUSIC THEY COULDN'T HEAR THEY JUST COULDN'T
I EVEN WROTE A SONG
THEY HAD TO COVER THEIR EARS FROM THE HORRIBLE SOUND
THE PEOPLE IN FRANKTOWN DECIDED TO HAVE A GREAT BIG PARADE IN FRANKVILLE SO CELEBRATED IN FACT FOR ONCE THERE WAS NO WATER PROBLEM NO NO FLY PROBLEM AND NO FLUTE PROBLEM
THEN SUDDENLY A FLY LANDED ON A LITTLE GIRL THEN A FLY LANDED ON SOMEONE ELSE THEN SOME LANDED ON A BUNCH OF PEOPLE
SO THERE WAS A PROBLEM IN THE T LITTLE TOWN OF FRANKSVILLE
IT WAS THEN THAT PEOPLE OF FRANKSVILLE REALIZED THAT THEY WOULDN'T HAVE TO TAKE GOD GOOD WITH THEM THE BAD
THE NEIGHBORS ARE COMPLAINING AND THE CATS AND DOGS ARE TRYING TO CHEW OFF THEIR EARS
HE STARTED SHAKING THE FLUTE TO GET THE FLIES OFF AND ACCIDENTALLY SMASHED INTO PIECES
WINDOWS WERE BREAKING AND ALL THE COWS IN THE TOWN STARTED TO MAKE SOUR MILK
THEY GOT TONS AND TONS OF FLIES
JOHN THE DENTIST WAS TRYING TO DRIVING THE FLIES AWAY
I'M SERIOUS STILL IT'S NOT A BAD AS BAD AS MILLIONS OF FLIES I SUPPOSE
EVERYONE CHEERED
THEN HE PLAYED THE SONG THE POLICE CHIEF HATED THE SOUND SO MUCH THAT HE THREW JOHN IN JAIL BUT HE COULDN'T KEEP JOHN IN JAIL SINCE HE WAS ALREADY BREAKING ANY LAWS
THEN THEY DECIDED TO LOWER HIM DOWN A WELL LET HIM PLAY WHERE THERE WERE NO ONE COULD HEAR HIM
THEN SUDDENLY THE FLIES FLEW AWAY AS FAST AS THEY COULD
THEY WERE UP IN THE MAIN FLOAT AS BIG BAND PLAYED AS THEY MARCHED UP AND DOWN MAIN STREET
SO THEY DECIDED THAT JOHN COULD PLAY THE FLUTE AND EVERYBODY ELSE WOULD HAVE TO WEAR EARPLUGS
LOOK JOHN I'VE HEARD YOU PLAY THE CLARINET YOU QUI YOU'RE QUITE GOOD WHY DON'T YOU PLAY THE THAT INSTEAD THE CHIEF S SAID CHIEF SANDERS
NO NO PLEASE DON'T PLAY THE OLD FLUTE BEGGED DOCTOR WONG
AND GUESS WHAT IT WORKED DOCTOR WONG IN THE TOWN HERO
ROOSTER JOHN
TOWN WHO PLAYED THE FLUTE SO BADLY THAT PEOPLE WOULD RUN AWAY SCREAMING
BUT SOMETIMES WE DON'T ALWAYS THINK ALL THAT GREAT UNDER PRESSURE
IT KEEPS HITTING ME ON THE SHELL AND TRYING TO ROLL ME OVER AND WHEN YOU LEAVE THE ROOM YOU
I WOULD LIKE TO START BY SAYING THAT I THINK THAT YOU ARE VERY MEAN TO M MAKE ME DO THIS BECAUSE IT WASN'T EVEN MY FAULT
FINE OSCAR CAN'T REALLY TALK BUT IF HE COULD HE WOULD HAVE SAID PLEASE SHAVE THE CAT
DEAR MOM DON'T LET DAD KNOW THAT THE REAL SH REASON I SHAVED THE CAT WAS THAT HE'S ALWAYS SNEEZING AROUND
DEAR MOM AND DAD JENNY DIDN'T BRUSH HER TEETH LAST NIGHT
I SWEAR THAT'S THE REASON ALSO I WAS GOING TO SELL THE CAT FUR AND BUY MY SISTER JENNY BRACES FOR HER BIG STUPID FACE
BUT MY STUPID SISTER NEVER TAUGHT HER CAT HOW TO LISTEN SO SHE JUST IGNORED ME
I I JUST DIDN'T WANT TO SEE THE CAT GETTING ALL HOT AND UNCOMFORTABLE AND STUFF
INSTEAD THE CAT CAME INTO MY ROOM BECAUSE JENNY NEVER PLAYS WITH IT ENOUGH
SHE'S NO GOOD AT SCHOOL AND YOU BOUGHT HER A CAT CAUSE SHE'S SO RESPONSIBLE AND STUFF
YOU WOULDN'T ALWAYS TAKE THE CAT'S SIDE IF YOU KNEW THAT IF YOU KNEW THE STUFF HE HID DID TO MY POOR TURTLE CAT'S AREN'T ALWAYS NICE JUST LIKE MY SISTER JENNY ISN'T ALWAYS NICE
P S IF YOU WOULD HAVE BOUGHT HER A TURTLE I COULDN'T H HAVE SHAVED IT SINCERELY DANNY
I PROMISE THAT I'LL DO A BETTER JOB THEN I DID ON THE CAT CAUSE NOW I HAVE WHAT DAD CALLS LIFE EXPERIENCE
OK HERE'S WHAT HAPPENED AS I REMEMBER IT
CAN I GET A DOG PLEASE SO IN CONCLUSION I'M GETTING HUNGRY AND I'M SORRY FOR SHAVING THE CAT ALTHOUGH YOU CAN SEE THAT IT'S REALLY JENNY'S FAULT FOR NOT BEING AS RESPONSIBLE AS YOU ALWAYS SAY AND NOT BRUSHING HER TEETH
THEY JUST RAN ON THAT STUPID WHEEL AND DIDN'T AND DID STUPID THINGS THAT'S THE LAST TIME I SHAVE THE CAT TO PROTECT ANY STUPID GERBILS
SO I THOUGHT THAT IF I COULD SHAVE THE CAT A LOT OF A LOT OF BUNCH OF TIMES HER HAIR WOULD GROW BACK HARDER EACH TIME AND SOON SHE WOULD HAVE AN IN INVINCIBLE COAT OF CAT FUR ARMOR
AND WHEN YOU LEAVE THE ROOM
I WAS AFRAID TO TELL YOU THE REAL REASON I SHAVED THE CAT WAS THAT I WANT TO BE A BARBER AND I NEEDED PRACTICE
IT WAS AN ACCIDENT AND I DIDN'T EVEN DO IT ON PURPOSE
SO IT REALLY SO IT WAS REALLY MY FATHER'S DAY GIFT TO HIM I COULDN'T BUY HIM ANYTHING NICE SINCE YOU TOOK AWAY MY ALLOWANCE FOR WHEN I SHAVED THE NEIGHBOR'S DOG
I'LL BET YOU DIDN'T KNOW SOMETHING ELSE DID YOU KNOW THAT I WANTED TO BE A BARBER
IF I HAD A CAT I WOULD TEACH IT TO NOT SHAVE ITSELF THAT'S FOR SURE
BUT SO WHAT IF IT'S WINTER I MEAN IT'LL BE SUMMER SOON ENOUGH AND I JUST WANTED THAT CAT TO GET USED TO THE IDEA BEFORE IT GOT REALLY HOT
I THINK IT REALLY LIKES LIKED IT ITS HAIRCUT THE ONLY REASON IT HASN'T COME OUT FOR TWO WEEKS IS BECAUSE YOU GUYS MADE SUCH A BIG DEAL ABOUT IT POOR KITTY THIS AND POOR KITTY THAT IT'S YOUR FAULT REALLY
JUST CAUSE SHE'S A GOOD STUDENT DOESN'T MEAN SHE'S REALLY RESPONSIBLE
I KNEW OUR CAT WOULD GROW HER FUR BACK BUT SOME CATS DON'T HAVE HAIR
ACTUALLY THE T TRUTH IS THAT I BY ACCIDENT TURNED ON THE NOSE HAIR CLIPPERS AND THE CAT WAS BEING CHASED BY THE TURTLE
SO I GRABBED DAD'S NOSE HAIR CLIPPERS AND SHAVED IT
DEAR MOM AND DAD PARENTS
AND YOU KNOW WHAT THOSE STUPID GERBILS DIDN'T EVEN THANK ME
SHE SAID THAT WHEN WE SHAVE HAIR IT GROWS BACK HARDER AND SOMETIMES EVEN DARKER
I COULDN'T HELP IT ANYWAY
I KNOW HOW MUCH YOU HATE HIM ALWAYS SNEEZING AND STUFF SO I THOUGHT IF I GET GOT RID OF HIS FUR HE WOULDN'T SNEEZE AND THAT YOU WOULD HAVE A BETTER MARRIAGE
I THINK THAT SHE SHOULD BRUSH HER TEETH TWICE TONIGHT THAT'S JUST MY OPINION THOUGH
PLUS I FORGOT TO TELL YOU THAT YOU SHOULD BE BLAMING MRS CASPER MY SCIENCE TEACHER SHE MADE US SHAVE SOMETHING FOR SCIENCE ASK HER
SEE SHE'S S NOT SO RESPONSIBLE AFTER ALL
THE CAT LIKED BEING SHAVED ANYWAY SO I DON'T SEE THE BIG DEAL
YOU GUYS WILL JUST PROBABLY SAY IT'S DINNER DANNY CATS IT'S WINTER DANNY CATS DON'T OVERHEAT IN WINTER
BUT THE REALEST REASON I I SHAVED THE CAT WAS TO MAKE A WIG FOR THOSE POOR HAIR LESS CATS THAT WE SAW ON TV ON THE ANIMAL CHANNEL
I SAW THAT THE CAT WAS TRYING TO GET THE GERBILS AND YOU TOLD US WE COULDN'T HIT ANIMALS SO I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT ELSE TO DO
NOT THAT I SHAVED THE CAT THOUGH
PLUS IF YOU WEREN'T ALWAYS CUDDLING WITH MY SISTER SO MUCH MAYBE SHE WOULD HAVE BEEN WITH HER CAT
BESIDES THE REAL REASON I SHAVED THE CAT WAS TO KEEP IT NICE AND COOL
THEN SHE WOULD BE A SUPER CAT AND YOU COULD TAKE HER ON TV SHOWS AND GET LOTS OF MONEY SO THAT YOU CAN SEND JENNY TO COLLEGE EVEN IF SHE IS A DUMB LITTLE TATTLE'TALE
YOU GUYS NEVER LIKED OSCAR AS MUCH AS THE CAT ANYWAY
I REALLY DIDN'T MEAN TO SHAVE THE CAT REALLY I SWEAR
I WAS AFRAID YOU WOULDN'T LET ME PRACTICE ON MY OWN HEAD CAN I PRACTICE BY SHAVING JENNY'S HEAD
HOW COME JENNY GETS A CAT AND I GET A STUPID TURTLE ANYWAY TURTLES DON'T DO ANYTHING EXCEPT POKE THEIR HEADS OUT AND BE NOT CUDDLY
I DIDN'T HAVE TO GET GOOD GRADES TO KNOW THAT YOU SHOULDN'T TEACH A CAT TO SHAVE ITSELF
DAD PLEASE DON'T READ THE NEXT PART
PLUS OSCAR MY TURTLE TOLD ME TO SHAVE THE CAT
LAST NIGHT I SAW THAT SHE DIDN'T BRUSH HER TEETH OH YEAH I FORGOT TO TELL YOU THAT
THEY ARE CALLED HAIRLESS CATS AND THEY NEED FUR IN THE WINTER SOMETIMES I THINK
YOU SHOULD BE PROUD OF ME FOR THINKING SO FAST ON MY TOES
RAN RIGHT BY THE CLIPPERS AND SHAVED HERSELF I KEPT SAYING NO KITTY NO DON'T SHAVE YOURSELF
SINCE YOU HAVE GROUNDED ME AND TOLD ME TO WRITE DOWN WHY I AM SORRY BEFORE I WAS ALLOWED OUT OF MY ROOM I AM MAD AT YOU
OH SURE IT'S EASY TO SAY THAT I SHOULD HAVE PICKED JUST PICKED UP THE CAT
THIS CAN ALSO ALMOST BE CER THIS CAN ALMOST CERTAINLY BE ACCOUNTED FOR BY THIS STRANGE ALMOST MAGICAL EFFECT THAT THE PANDAS POSSESS
NO WAIT A SECOND I DON'T UNDERSTAND
T'WOULD BE BEST TO FLY
THE FATHER WATCHING THIS ALL THROUGH ONE EYE
I THINK WHAT THE ZOO NEEDS IS A GREAT ADVERTISING CAMPAIGN
PROUD OF HER DAUGHTER AFTER ALL IF IT WEREN'T FOR YIN YIN THEY WOULD HAVE HAD TO MOVE THEIR YELLOW UMBRELLA ALL SHE COULD SAY WAS NONSENSE
MAGGIE FIGURED THAT IF SHE AND THREE OF HER STRONGEST MAGPIE FRIENDS MAGPIE FRIENDS
BUT I JUST LEARNED HOW TO MAKE MYSELF INTO A BALL AND ROLL TWO DAYS AGO AND I'VE BECOMING VERY GOOD AT THAT I DON'T THINK THAT IT WILL TAKE THAT LONG TO ROLL THERE SAID YIN YIN
NO HOW MANY MAGPIE'S WOULD IT WOULD BE NEEDED TO FLY A FOUR HOUR I MEAN HUNDRED POUND PANDA BEAR AND A ONE HUNDRED POUND BAMBOO ROCKET TO THE SHIP I MEAN ROCKETSHIP TO THE MOON SAID MAGGIE THE OWL INSTANTLY INSTANTLY REPLIED
AND WAS IN TERRIFIC SHAPE BUT PHYSICAL FITNESS WAS NOT THE ONLY REASON THAT FRED LOVED PANDAS
ONE DAY AFTER FRED HAD FED THE PANDAS AND WAS HUGGING THE PALM TREE THE ZOO MANAGER CAME UP TO HIM AND SAID WHAT IS GOING ON WITH YOUR PANDAS FRED I'VE NEVER SEEN ANYTHING LIKE IT
THE OTHER REASON THAT WAS WAS THAT ANYONE WHO GETS WITHIN THREE FEET OF A PANDA AUTOMATICALLY FALLS IN LOVE WITH THEM
WHY DID THE PANDA WITH THE BEAUTIFUL GIRL NAME YIN YIN HAVE HER NAME CHANGED TO THE VERY UN BEAUTIFUL GIRL NAMED COLUMBUS
WELL SIR WHEN COLUMBUS SET OUT ON HIS SHIP HE WAS REALLY TRYING TO FIND A QUICKER WAY TO GET AROUND EUROPE IN ORDER TO IMPROVE TRADE
FOR FRED WHEN IT CAME TO THE PANDAS HE HAD A WARM SPOT IN HIS HEART
NOW WHILE ALL THIS WAS GOING ON WHAT DO YOU SUPPOSED FRED WAS DOING
SO MAGGIE FLEW TO THE OWL AND ASKED FOR ADVICE
WERE TO EACH GRAB HOLD OF THE CORNER OF THE ROCKETSHIP THEY COULD ALL FLY TO THE MOON SO THEY TRIED
SHE WOULD BE A VERY PERSUASIVE LITTLE BIRD WHEN SHE WANTED
FRED WAS NOT ALLOWED TO ACTUALLY HUG THE PANDA BEARS SINCE THAT COULD BE DANGEROUS
THIS IS JUST THE TYPE OF EXPOSURE WE NEEDED THOSE PANDAS WILL BE WITH US FOR A LONG TIME
IS A DECIDEDLY ROUND ABOUT WAY TO GO IF YOU MUST GO
HE DIDN'T MIND HANDLING THE RAW MEAT HE HAD TO FEED TO THE TIGERS
IT'S NOT THAT YOU AREN'T SELLING ENOUGH STUFFED PANDA BEARS IT'S JUST THAT THERE HAVEN'T BEEN ENOUGH PEOPLE COMING TO SEE YOU IN THE FIRST PLACE
NONSENSE YOUR JOB IS TO BE CUTE SO PEOPLE WANT TO RUN TO THE GIFT SHOP AND BUY PANDA BEAR DOLLS
THEY WERE IN ORDER OF CUTENESS YIN YIN THE YOUNG DAUGHTER POO POO THE MOTHER AND MOO MAN THE GENTLE AND ALWAYS SLEEPING FATHER
SHE SAID SPITEFULLY AN INSTANT LATER A YOUNG BOY WAS HEARD SAYING OUCH MOM CUT THAT OUT
HER MOTHER AND FATHER KNEW WHAT THEY WERE TALKING ABOUT SINCE THEY HADN'T THOUGHT OR TALKED OF MUCH ELSE SINCE YIN YIN SAID I WANT TO GO THERE AND POINTED TO THE MOON
FOR HE HAD ALWAYS HAD AT LEAST ONE EYE ASLEEP AT ALL TIMES SAID
WERE TO
AND SHOWED HIS SUPPORT BY TAKING A NAP
OH WELL THAT MAKES SENSE THEN THE MAN SAID THE MANAGER
AT FURTHER DISTANCES PANDAS HAVE A STRANGE ALMOST MAGICAL EFFECT ON HUMAN BEINGS
IT I WOULD HATE IF YOU HAD TO LEAVE US AFTER ALL IT'S THE ONLY HOME YOU KNOW BESIDES IF YOU LEAVE I'LL GET TERRIBLY OUT OF SHAPE NOW IF YOU EXCUSE ME I NEED TO SQUEEZE SOMETHING BEFORE I SCREAM
FRED FED THE PANDA BEARS AND THE TIGERS AND TURTLES
YES BUT WHAT DOES THAT HAVE TO DO WITH THE PANDAS AN MAN THE ZOO MANAGER SAID THE ZOO MANAGER WELL IT SEEMS TO ME SIR THAT YIN YIN WANTED TO BE A GREAT EXPLORER AND INSTEAD BECAME A BUSINESS WOMAN I SEE FRED
IT'S NOT THAT WE
THERE WERE THREE PANDAS AND THEY WERE KNOWN AS THE PAN FAMILY
HOW
I SEE YOUR WINGS FLAPPING BUT WE DON'T SEEM TO BE GOING ANYWHERE YIN YIN
A WEEK LATER DESPITE HOW MUCH FLAPPING THEY WERE STILL TRYING TO GET THE ROCKET IN THE AIR
FRED THOUGHT ABOUT FRED THOUGHT ABOUT IT AND SAID YOU THINK WE SHOULD RENAME YIN YIN COLUMBUS
IT
YES THE BIG ONE IN THE SKY THAT IS MOST LIKELY NOT MADE OF CHEESE AND IS MOST CERTAINLY NOT MADE OF BAMBOO
NO ONE COULD BLAME FRED REALLY SINCE NO ONE REALLY WANTS TO BE EATEN
HMM HEAVIER THAN I THOUGHT I THINK WE'LL NEED MORE MAGPIES MAGGIE SAID MAGGIE
BACK IN THE PANDA'S HOME THE MOTHER PANDA POO POO WAS VERY
BAMBOO IS VERY WORKABLE SUBSTANCE THAT PANDAS TEND TO HANDLE BAMBOO A LOT SO THIS IS IN ITSELF WAS NOT THAT ASTONISHING AT LEAST TO YIN YIN'S PARENTS FRED SURE WAS IMPRESSED THOUGH
WHICH YOUNG LADY HELPS PAY FOR THE BAMBOO THAT YOU EAT
MANY PEOPLE KNOW THAT PANDAS EAT BAMBOO A LOT OF IT
NONSENSE SAID THE MOTHER I'M SO MAD I'M GOING TO LOOK AT THAT LADY OVER THERE AND MAKE HER WANT TO SQUEEZE HER SON CHEEKS
BUT EVERYTHING WAS NOT ALL BAMBOO AND HUGS AT THE ZOO ONE MORNING FRED WAS FEEDING YIN YIN AND SAID OH YIN YIN I WISH THAT MORE PEOPLE COULD COME TO VISIT THE ZOO
WHERE WHERE DISCUSSING ABOUT GOING TO THE MOON WERE DISCUSSING ABOUT GOING TO THE MOON
FRED WAS STARTING TO FEEL THE UNCONTROLLABLE URGE TO HUG THE PANDA SO BEFORE HE RAN OFF TO HUG THE PALM TREE QUICKLY SAID IT COSTS SO MUCH TO FEED YOU PANDA BEARS I WOULD HATE
AS FOR YIN YIN SHE WAS VERY PROUD TO BE RENAMED AFTER A FAMOUS EXPLORER AND SHE AND MAGGIE NEVER STOPPED TRYING TO GET TO THE MOON
TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND AND SEVENTY SIX GIVE OR TAKE TWO
YIN YIN'S FATHER MOO MAN DIDN'T THINK THAT IT WAS VERY PROPER OR WISE FOR A YOUNG PANDA BEAR TO GO ROLLING OFF PLACES WHERE THERE WASN'T ANY BAMBOO BUT HE WAS SUPPORTIVE OF HIS YOUNG DAUGHTER
IT'S TAKEN ME A COUPLE OF WEEKS TO FIGURE IT OUT BUT I THINK YIN YIN WANTS TO GO TO THE MOON AND THE MAGPIES WANT TO TAKE HER THERE SAID FRED
IT'S A LAW OF NATURE
IT WAS FRED'S IDEA SO LET'S BEGIN WITH FRED
HE WANTED TO BE A BUSINESS MAN BUT INSTEAD BECAME A GREAT EXPLORER
I KNOW I SHOULDN'T BE TELLING YOU THIS BUT WE MIGHT HAVE TO SELL YOU AND YOUR FAMILY TO THE BIG ZOO IN SAN ANGELES IF WE DON'T GET MORE MONEY
ACTUALLY IT WAS AN EIGHT FIVE POINT FIVE DEGREE SPOT ON HIS LEFT KIDNEY BUT THE POINT IS THAT HE WAS VERY FOND OF FEEDING THE PANDAS
A LITTLE BOY'S CHEEKS HAVE BEEN MADE RAW WHEN THEIR MOTHER POO POO PANDA WAS UPSET
OH WISE OWL I HAVE A QUESTION THAT I FEAR YOU ONLY YOU CAN ANSWER SHE SAID
ONE TWO THREE TO THE MOON THEY ALL SAID TOGETHER PULLING WITH ALL THEIR MIGHT
SO ALL THE OTHER PEOPLE AT THE ZOO KNOW WOULD KNOW THAT THE PANDAS HAD JUST BEEN FED WHEN THEY SAW FRED HUGGING THE RATHER UN CUDDLY PALM TREE OUTSIDE THE PANDA'S HOME
BUT HIS MAIN OBJECTION WAS BEING EATEN
BUT YIN YIN THE YOUNG PANDA WAS NOT LISTENING TO FRED SHE WAS TALKING TO HER BEST FRIEND MAGGIE THE MAGPIE ABOUT GOING TO THE MOON
YIN YIN WAS ALWAYS ONE TO TAKE GOOD ADVICE FROM HER FATHER AND LESS THAN A WEEK LATER YIN YIN AND MAGPIE MAGPIE MAGGIE HAD BUILT A ROCKET SHIP OUT OF BAMBOO
I THINK THAT THE ZOO NEEDS
IT'S SIMPLE ECONOMICS LIKE IT OR NOT WE ARE SPOKESPEOPLE FOR THE PANDA STUFFED ANIMAL INDUSTRY
I'M SORRY TO SAY BUT MANY
T'WOULD BE BEST TO ASK THE OWL HE CLOSED HIS EYE THEN CLOSED EYE
ENOUGH OF THIS NONSENSE SAID YIN YIN'S MOTHER POO POO
A WEEK LATER MAGGIE NAMED HER MANAGED TO ROUND UP TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND AND SEVENTY EIGHT MAGPIE
BUT BEFORE HE FELL ASLEEP HE DID MANAGE TO SAY I BELIEVE ROLLING IS A DECIDEDLY
WHICH MAKES US WANT TO HUG AND SQUEEZE THINGS
THE TURTLES WEREN'T SO BAD BUT AS FOR THE TIGERS HE WASN'T SO SURE
BUT YIN YIN WAS THE YOUNG
ONE MORE THING SIR ABOUT THOSE MAGPIES FLYING ABOVE THE PANDAS DO YOU THINK THAT THE ZOO COULD PURCHASE ME A LARGE SIZED UMBRELLA
WHAT SORT OF NONSENSE IS THIS FOR A YOUNG PANDA BEAR GOING TO THE MOON INDEED
HE WAS FEEDING THE PANDAS LIKE HE WAS SUPPOSED TO
THE PANDA
SO BEING EATEN WAS DEFINITELY NOT SOMETHING HE LOOKED FORWARD T TO EACH AFTERNOON AT THREE O'CLOCK WHEN IT WAS TIME TO FEED THE TIGERS
IT TURNS OUT THAT THE OWL DIDN'T TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION THAT ONCE YOU GET OVER ONE THOUSAND MAGPIE TOGETHER THEY TEND TO FIGHT AND CAN'T AGREE ON A SINGLE THING
IT IS INTERESTING TO POINT OUT AT THIS TIME THAT MORE STUFFED PANDA BEARS ARE SOLD AT ZOO GIFT SHOPS THEN ALL OF THE OTHER STUFF ANIMALS COMBINED
THE ZOO KEEPER SAID GOOD HEAVENS MAN THAT IS A GREAT IDEA
YES BUT HOW MANY MORE YIN YIN SAID I'M NOT SURE EXACTLY SAID MAG MAGGIE
SOME PEOPLE DO NOT LIKE TO BITE THEIR FINGER NAILS BUT FRED WASN'T A NAIL BITER
YIN YIN AND HER BEST FRIEND MAGPIE MAGGIE THE MAGPIE WHO LOOKED A LOT LIKE A PANDA WOULD LOOK IF PANDAS WERE BIRDS
THE MAIN OBSTACLE IT TURNS OUT WAS GETTING THE ROCKETSHIP OFF THE GROUND
IS I THINK THAT WHAT THE ZOO NEEDS
TO TURN YOUR HEAD ALL THE WAY AROUND WITHOUT GO WITHOUT GETTING A TERRIBLE PAIN IN YOUR NECK SAID OWL
A LOT OF BAMBOO CAN GET QUITE HEAVY SO BECAUSE OF THE PANDAS FRED BECAME VERY STRONG
SUCH NONSENSE GOING TO THE MOON SAID HER MOTHER POO POO
YOUR JOB IS TO BE CUTE SO PEOPLE WON'T TO RUN TO THE GIFT SHOP AND BUY PANDA BEAR DOLLS
THE MAIN OBSTACLE IT TURNS OUT WAS GETTING THE ROCKET SHIP OFF THE GROUND
I KNOW I SHOULDN'T BE TELLING YOU THIS BUT WE MIGHT HAVE TO SELL YOU AND YOUR FAMILY TO THE BIG ZOO IN SAN ANGELES
BUT HE WAS SUPPORTIVE OF HIS YOUNG DAUGHTER AND SHOWED HIS SUPPORT BY TAKING A NAP
WHY HE WAS FEEDING PANDAS LIKE HE WAS SUPPOSED TO DO
THE OTHER REASON WAS THAT ANYONE WHO GETS WITHIN THREE FEET OF THE PANDA AUTOMATICALLY FALLS IN LOVE WITH THEM
WHY DID A PANDA WITH A BEAUTIFUL GIRL NAME YIN YIN HAVE HER NAME CHANGED TO THE B TO THE VERY UN BEAUTIFUL GIRL NAME COLUMBUS
IT'S A LAW OF NATURE
BUT THE POINT IS THAT HE WAS VERY FOND OF FEEDING THE PANDAS
BACK IN THE PANDA'S HOME THE MOTHER PANDA POO POO WAS VERY PROUD OF HER DAUGHTER
THE ZOO KEEPER SAID GOOD HEAVENS MAN THAT IS A GREAT IDEA NO WAIT A SECOND I UNDERSTAND
A WEEK LATER MAGGIE MANAGED TO ROUND UP TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND AND SEVENTY EIGHT MAGPIE
AN INSTANT LATER A YOUNG BOY WAS HEARD SAYING OUCH MOM CUT THAT OUT
OH WELL THAT MAKES SENSE THEN SAID THE MANAGER
HER MOTHER AND FATHER KNEW WHAT THEY WERE TALKING ABOUT SINCE THEY HADN'T THOUGHT OR TALKED OF MUCH ELSE SINCE YIN YIN SAID
HE DIDN'T MIND HANDLING THE RAW MEAT HE HAD TO FEED TO THE TIGERS HIS MAIN OBJECTION WAS TO BEING TO BEING EATEN

IT IS INTERESTING TO POINT OUT AT THIS TIME THAT MORE STUFFED PANDA BEARS ARE SOLD TO ZOO GIFT SHOPS THEN ALL OF THE OTHER STUFFED ANIMALS COMBINED
I DON'T THINK IT WILL TAKE THAT LONG TO ROLL THERE SAID YIN YIN
A LOT OF BAMBOO CAN GET QUITE HEAVY SO BECAUSE OF THE PANDAS FRED BECAME VERY STRONG AND WAS
SO BEFORE HE RAN OFF TO HUG THE PALM TREE QUICKLY HE SAID IT COSTS SO MUCH TO FEED YOU PANDA BEARS I WOULD HATE IT IF YOU HAD TO LEAVE US
LIKE IT OR NOT WE ARE SPOKESPEOPLE FOR THE PANDAS STUFFED ANIMALS INDUSTRY WHICH YOUNG LADY HELPS PAY FOR THE BAMBOO THAT YOU EAT
THE OWL INSTANTLY INSTANTLY REPLIED TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND AND SEVENTY SIX GIVE OR TAKE TWO
WHAT IS GOING ON WITH YOUR PANDAS FRED I'VE NEVER SEEN ANYTHING LIKE IT
YIN YIN AND HER BEST FRIEND MAGGIE AND THE MAGPIE WHO LOOKED A LOT LIKE A PANDA WOULD LOOK IF PANDAS WERE BIRDS
FRED FED THE PANDA BEARS THE TIGERS AND THE TURTLES
HE WANTED TO BE A BUSINESS MAN BUT INSTEAD BECAME A GREAT EXPLORER
FRED WAS NOT ALLOWED TO ACTUALLY HUG THE PANDA BEARS SINCE THAT COULD BE DANGEROUS
THEY WERE IN ORDER OF CUTENESS YIN YIN THE YOUNG DAUGHTER POO POO AND MOTHER AND MOO MAN THE GENTLE AND ALWAYS SLEEPY FATHER
BUT LATER WHEN FRED WALKED INTO THE PANDA'S H HOME UNDER A A HIS NEW YELLOW UMBRELLA ALL SHE COULD THINK TO SAY WAS NONSENSE
I THINK THAT THE ZOO NEEDS ITS A GREAT ADVENTURE CAMPAIGN
A WEEK LATER DESPITE MUCH FLAPPING THEY WERE STILL TRYING AND TO GET OUT THE ROCKET IN THE AIR
THIS IS JUST THE TYPE OF EXPOSURE WE NEEDED THOSE PANDAS WILL BE WITH US FOR A LONG TIME
SO MAGGIE FLEW TO THE OWL AND ASKED FOR HIS ADVICE
ENOUGH OF THIS NONSENSE SAID YIN YIN'S MOTHER POO POO
SOME PEOPLE DO NOT LIKE TO BITE THEIR FINGER NAILS BUT FRED WASN'T A NAIL BITER SO BEING EATEN WAS DEFINITELY NOT SOMETHING HE LOOKED FORWARD TO
OH WISE OWL I HAVE A QUESTION THAT I FEAR ONLY YOU CAN ANSWER SHE SAID
BAMBOO IS VERY WORKABLE SUBSTANCE AND PANDAS TEND TO HANDLE BAMBOO A LOT SO THIS IS IN ITSELF WAS NOT THAT ASTONISHING
BUT EVERYTHING WAS NOT ALL BAMBOO AND HUGS AT THE ZOO
ONE MORE THING SIR ABOUT THOSE MAGPIES FLYING ABOVE THE PANDAS DO YOU THINK THAT THE ZOO COULD PURCHASE ME A LARGE SIZED UMBRELLA
IN TERRIFIC SHAPE
YES BUT HOW MANY MORE YIN YIN SAID I'M NOT EXACTLY SURE REPLIED MAGGIE
NOW IF YOU EXCUSE ME I NEED TO SQUEEZE SOMETHING BEFORE I SCREAM
NO HOW MANY MAGPIES WOULD BE NEEDED TO FLY A FOUR HUNDRED POUND PANDA BEAR AND A ONE HUNDRED POUND BAMBOO ROCKET SHIP TO THE MOON SAID MAGGIE
IT'S SIMPLE ECONOMICS
IF WE DON'T GET MORE MONEY IT'S NOT THAT YOU AREN'T SELLING ENOUGH STUFFED PANDA BEARS
MAGGIE FIGURED THAT IF SHE HAD THREE OF HER STRONGEST MAGPIE FRIENDS WERE TO EACH GRAB HOLD OF THE CORNER OF THE ROCKET SHIP THEY COULD ALL FLY TO THE MOON
SO ONE DAY AFTER FRED HAD FED THE PANDAS AND WAS HUGGING THE PALM TREE THE ZOO MANAGER CAME UP TO HIM AND SAID
BUT BEFORE HE FELL TO SLEEP HE DID MANAGE TO SAY
YES THE BIG ONE IN THE SKY THAT IS MOST LIKELY NOT MADE OF CHEESE AND MOST CERTAINLY NOT MADE OF BAMBOO
FOR HE WAS FOR HE ALWAYS HAD AT LEAST ONE EYE ASLEEP AT ALL TIMES
IT WAS FRED'S IDEA SO LET'S BEGIN WITH FRED
WHEN COLUMBUS SET OUT ON HIS SHIP HE WAS REALLY TRYING TO FIND A QUICKER WAY TO GET TO GET AROUND EUROPE IN ORDER TO IMPROVE TRADE
AT FURTHER DISTANCES PANDAS HAVE A STRANGE ALMOST MAGICAL EFFECT ON HUMAN BEINGS WHICH MAKES US WANT TO HUG AND SQUEEZE THINGS
THERE WERE THREE PANDAS AND THEY WERE KNOWN AS THE PAN FAMILY
AFTER ALL IT WEREN'T IF IT WEREN'T FOR YIN YIN THEY WOULD HAVE HAD TO MOVE FROM THEIR WONDERFUL HOME
IT'S JUST THAT THEY HAVEN'T BEEN ENOUGH PEOPLE COMING TO SEE YOU IN THE FIRST PLACE
SHE COULD BE A VERY PERSUASIVE LITTLE BIRD WHEN SHE WANTED
I SEE YOUR WINGS FLAPPING BUT WE DON'T SEE SEEM TO BE GOING ANYWHERE SAID YIN YIN
DID YOU KNOW THAT SINCE THE LITTLE PANDA BUILT THAT BAMBOO ROCKET SHIP AND THOSE MAGPIES STARTED FLUTTERING ABOUT THAT THE ZOO'S PROFITS HAS GONE UP F FOUR THOUSAND PERCENT
THEN CLOSED HIS EYE
NO ONE COULD BLAME FRED REALLY SINCE NO ONE REALLY WANTS TO BE EATEN
I WANT TO GO THERE AND POINTED TO THE MOON
THIS CAN ALMOST CERTAINLY BE ACCOUNTED FOR BY THIS STRANGE ALMOST MAGICAL EFFECT THAT THE PANDA POSSESS POSSESS
I SEE FRED
YIN YIN WAS ALWAYS ONE TO TAKE GOOD ADVICE FROM HER FATHER AND LESS THAN A WEEK LATER YIN YIN AND MAGGIE HAD BUILT A ROCKET SHIP OUT OF BAMBOO
YIN YIN'S FATHER MOO MAN
AFTER ALL IT'S ONLY HOME YOU KNOW BESIDES IF YOU LEAVE I'LL GET TERRIBLY OUT OF SHAPE
HMM HEAVIER THAN I THOUGHT I THINK WE WILL NEED SOME MAGPIES SAID MAGGIE
SUCH NONSENSE GOING TO THE MOON SAID HER MOTHER POO POO
SO THEY TRIED ONE TWO THREE TO THE MOON THEY SAID TOGETHER PULLING IN THEIR MIGHT
IT'S TAKEN ME A COUPLE OF WEEKS TO FIGURE IT OUT BUT I THINK YIN YIN WANTS TO GO TO THE MOON AND THE MAGPIES WANT TO TAKE HER THERE SAID FRED
NONSENSE SAID THE MOTHER I'M SO MAD I'M GOING TO LOOK AT THE LADY OVER THERE AND MAKE HER WANT TO SQUEEZE HER SON CHEEKS SHE SAID SPITEFULLY
SAID T'WOULD BE BEST TO ASK THE OWL
THE TURTLES WEREN'T SO BAD BUT AS FOR THE TIGERS HE WASN'T SO SURE
WERE DISCUSSING ABOUT GOING TO THE MOON
YES BUT WHAT DOES THAT HAVE TO DO WITH THE THE PANDAS MAN SAID THE ZOO KEEPER MANAGER
SO ALL THE OTHER PEOPLE AT THE ZOO WOULD NOT KNOW THAT THE PANDAS HAD JUST BEEN FED WHEN THEY SAW FRED HUGGING THE RATHER UN CUDDLY PALM TREE OUTSIDE OF THE PANDA'S HOME
MANY PEOPLE KNOW THAT PANDAS EAT BAMBOO A LOT OF IT
BUT I JUST LEARNED HOW TO MAKE MYSELF INTO A BALL AND ROLL TWO DAYS AGO I'VE I HAVE BECOMING VERY GOOD AT IT
AS FOR YIN SHE WAS VERY PROUD TO BE RENAMED AFTER A FAMOUS EXPLORER AND SHE AND MAGGIE NEVER STOPPED TRYING TO GET TO THE MOON
FRED WAS STARTING TO FEEL THE UNCOMFORTABLE URGE TO HUG THE PANDA
THE PANDA
WELL SIR
FOR FRED WHEN IT CAME TO THE PANDAS HE HAD A WARM SPOT IN HIS HEART ACTUALLY IT WAS A EIGHTY FIVE POINT FIVE DEGREE SPOT ON HIS LEFT KIDNEY
IT TURNS OUT THAT THE OWL DIDN'T TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION THAT ONCE YOU GET OVER ONE THOUSAND MAGPIE TOGETHER THEY TEND TO FIGHT AND CAN'T AGREE ON ONE SINGLE THING
FRED THOUGHT ABOUT IT AND SAID YOU KNOW I THINK WE SHOULD RENAME YIN YIN COLUMBUS
HOW TO TURN YOUR HEAD ALL THE WAY AROUND WITHOUT GETTING A TERRIBLE PAIN IN YOUR NECK SAID OWL
EACH AFTERNOON AT THREE O'CLOCK WHEN IT WAS TIME TO FEED THE TIGERS
WHAT SORT OF NONSENSE IS THIS FOR A YOUNG PANDA BEAR GOING TO THE MOON INDEED NONSENSE
ONE MORNING FRED WAS FEEDING YIN YIN AND SAID OH YIN YIN I WISH THAT MORE PEOPLE WOULD COME TO VISIT THE ZOO
THE ZOO MANAGER LAUGHED AND WALKED AWAY BUT DIDN'T PURCHASE A FASHIONABLE YELLOW UMBRELLA FOR FRED THE NEXT DAY
AT LEAST TO YIN YINS PARENTS FREDS SURE WAS IMPRESSED THOUGH
NOW WHILE ALL THIS WAS GOING ON WHAT DO YOU SUPPOSED FRED WAS DOING
BUT PHYSICAL FITNESS WAS NOT THE ONLY REASON THAT FRED LOVED THE PANDA
DIDN'T THINK IT WAS VERY PROPER OR WISE FOR A YOUNG PANDA BEAR TO GO ROLLING OFF TO PLACES WHERE THERE WASN'T ANY BAMBOO
BUT YIN YIN THE YOUNG PANDA WAS NOT LISTENING TO FRED SHE WAS TALKING TO HER BEST FRIEND MAGGIE AND MAGPIE ABOUT GOING TO THE MOON
THE FATHER WATCHING THIS ALL THROUGH ONE EYE
AND HE HUNG UP CAN'T FOOL ME SHE SAID HMM SOMETHING WILL HAVE TO BE DONE AND SHE WENT TO HER CLOSET

THREE
I DON'T
AT PUSHING BUTTONS THAN YOU ARE
ABOUT BEING BY YOURSELF ON AN AIRPLANE IS THAT THE FLIGHT ATTENDANTS ARE VERY NICE TO YOU
HAS FIVE BUTTONS AND I CAN'T GET PAST
THERE WAS GRANDPA WAITING FOR ME
I ONLY USED THE GREEN CRAYON BECAUSE IT WAS THE TALLEST AND I WANTED
TO BE QUIET AND WATCH THE MOVIE I TRIED TO WATCH THE MOVIE BUT I HAD ALREADY SEEN THAT ONE SO IT WAS BORING
FINALLY WE LANDED
BUT IT WAS HER FAULT
IT WASN'T REALLY THAT HARD ONCE YOU PRACTICED
I
IT WAS WORTH THE WHOLE TRIP JUST TO EAT A BANANA SPLIT WITH GRANDPA
I DIDN'T LIKE TO THINK ABOUT THAT BUT
AND HE COULDN'T EVEN PASS LEVEL ONE
BUT SOMETIMES PEOPLE LIKE TO EAT
I DIDN'T KNOW ANYONE AT ALL AND HAD TO GO ALL THE WAY
TO EVER STOP
TO HELP OTHER PASSENGERS
GO FISH
AND EAT PEANUTS AND GO TO THE BATHROOM
I WAS GLAD THAT THERE WASN'T ANYONE NEXT TO ME
YOU GO HIGHER THAN ANY MOUNTAIN AND YOU GO FASTER THAN ANY CAR
IT WAS TOO SHORT TO REACH THE BUTTON
AND I'LL ONLY SERVE BANANA SPLITS ON MY PLANE
SHE S SAID THAT SHE HAD
SHE SAID THEY DON'T HAVE ANY BANANA SPLITS ON A
BROWN BLUE YELLOW
IT WAS FUN AND SCARY
BORED AND WANTED TO PLAY
IMAGINE HOW HARD IT WOULD BE TO WORK
I ALWAYS I'VE ALWAYS THOUGHT FLYING WAS FUN
I TOLD HER THAT IT WAS THE PEANUTS THAT WERE MAKING ME SO THIRSTY
HE LAUGHED
FLIGHT ATTENDANT WOULD COME
AND
THE FLIGHT ATTENDANT GAVE ME A DECK OF CARDS BUT SHE WOULDN'T PLAY GO FISH WITH ME
THAT'S ALWAYS SCARY BECAUSE IT SEEMS LIKE EVEN THOUGH WE ARE
BUT I TOLD HER THAT I WOULD LIKE A BANANA SPLIT INSTEAD
I COULDN'T HELP IT
INVITING ME TO SEE THE COCKPIT
PEANUTS ON THEIR BANANA SPLITS
I SAID IF YOU CAN'T GET PAST LEVEL ONE AND YOU CAN BE A PILOT THEN I
I HAD A GAME BOY IN MY BACKPACK
PICTURES ALL GREEN SO IT DIDN'T TAKE VERY LONG
JENNIFER TOOK ME INTO THE COCKPIT AND THERE WERE LIKE A MILLION BUTTONS AND
SO
TOOK ME STRAIGHT TO THE
BUT YOU
SHE TOLD ME TO CALL HER JENNIFER INSTEAD
BUT TO TELL YOU THE TRUTH
THEN JENNIFER GA
THEN HE TOLD ME THAT
I THOUGHT GREAT MORE PEANUTS
I GUESS IT WAS BECAUSE THE PLANE WAS SO LOUD AND I DIDN'T KNOW ANYONE
BY MYSELF
SUDDENLY I THOUGHT WOW LOOK AT ALL THOSE BUTTONS
IT TO CATCH UP TO THE RED
I ALSO BROUGHT MY DECK OF CARDS IN CASE THE PILOT WAS
ONCE THE PLANE WAS IN THE AIR I WAS PRETTY GOOD
LEVEL THREE
I HAD SEVEN COLA'S AND FOUR GINGER ALE'S
I TRIED TO PUSH THE BUTTON THAT LIGHTS UP SO THE
HE SAID HOW WAS YOUR FLIGHT
STARTED YELLING HEY PEANUT LADY HEY PEANUT LADY
FOR SOME REASONS SHE KEPT TRYING TO GIVE ME PEANUTS
IT WAS SOMETHING REALLY COOL SHE SAID THE CAPTAIN WAS
BUT IT DID
FROM NEW YORK TO TEXAS WITHOUT MY PARENTS
WE ARE GOING TO CRASH
ONE THING
GET ME A BANANA SPLIT I WOULDN'T HAVE TO GO THE BATHROOM SO MUCH
SAID HE THOUGHT I WOULD MAKE A GREAT PILOT SOMEDAY IF I W WANTED TO BE
I COLORED THE DRAGON
GRANDPA LAUGHED AND THEN
THE PILOT TOLD ME
THE PERSON NEXT TO ME WOULD HAVE BEEN VERY ANNOYED
I WAS TOO SHORT TO REACH THE BUTTON
GET ME MY GAME BOY
I WAS GOING THERE TO SEE MY GRANDFATHER
THE AIRPLANE RIDE
I PLAYED ON MY GAME BOY UNTIL I GOT MY NEW HIGH SCORE
HE ONCE PLAYED THE GAME I HAD ON MY GAME BOY
THE PLANE
BUT IT WASN'T PEANUTS
I STARTED THINKING WE MIGHT CRASH
THAT THE PLANE IS GOING TOO FAST
THEN I THOUGHT THERE'S NO WAY THAT ANYONE CAN REMEMBER TO PUSH ALL THOSE BUTTONS AT THE RIGHT TIME
PURPLE AND BLACK ONES
EVEN THOUGH I WASN'T JOKING HE
IN THE FIRST PLACE AND THAT IF SHE WOULD
MY MOM GAVE ME A COLORING BOOK OF COOL LOOKING DRAGONS TO KEEP ME BUSY
ALL THOSE MILLIONS OF BUTTONS
WHICH MADE ME HAVE TO GO TO THE BATHROOM EIGHT TIMES
BUT GUESS WHAT
AND I SAID SOMEDAY I'M GOING TO BE A PILOT
ON THE GROUND
SHE DIDN'T LIKE BEING CALLED PEANUT LADY BUT SHE DID
COULD BE A PILOT TOO SINCE I'M MUCH BETTER
MY BACKPACK WAS IN THE OVERHEAD THINGY
WHEN I GOT OFF THE AIRPLANE
BEING
THE WAY I FIGURED IT MY GAME BOY ONLY
SHE TOLD ME
HE WAS REALLY NICE BUT HE WOULDN'T PLAY GO FISH WITH ME
ICE CREAM SHOP
EVEN THE FLIGHT ATTENDANT SEEMED A LITTLE ANNOYED THAT I HAD TO GO TO THE BATHROOM SO MUCH
THAT IT WAS
I THOUGHT AWESOME
THAT'S WHEN I MISSED MY PARENTS THE MOST
WE WERE GOING TO GO FISHING
THE FIRST TIME I EVER TOOK AN AIRPLANE RIDE
LEVERS AND KNOBS AND STUFF
CAME UP TO ME
THEN A FLY LANDED ON SOMEONE ELSE THEN SOME LANDED ON A BUNCH OF PEOPLE THEN PRETTY SOON TONS OF FLIES WERE LANDING ON EVERYONE
WINDOWS WERE BREAKING AND ALL THE COWS IN TOWN STARTED TO MAKE SOUR MILK
WHEN THE TOWNSFOLK HEARD THE NOISE THEY COULDN'T EVEN SWAT AT THE FLIES ANYMORE
I HAVE TO PLAY I WAS BORN TO DO IT
THE LOCAL D SCIENTIST DOCTOR WONG CAME UP WITH AN IDEA
THEIR PROBLEMS STARTED WHEN THEY RAN OUT OF WATER
SO THERE WAS A PROBLEM IN THE LITTLE TOWN OF FRANKSVILLE
HE WASN'T CALLED ROOSTER JOHN YET THAT CAME LATER
I EVEN EVEN WROTE YOU A SONG CHIEF SANDERS IT'S CALLED COPS AND ROBBERS
IT WAS THEN THAT THE PEOPLE OF FRANKSVILLE REALIZED THAT THEY WOULD HAVE TO TAKE THE GOOD WITH THE BAD
DOCTOR WONG AND JOHN WERE ALL THE STARS OF THE PARADE
MAYBE A POORLY PLAYED FLUTE DOESN'T SOUND ALL THAT BAD
NO ONE COULD HEAR ANYTHING PEOPLE WERE GETTING INTO CAR ACCIDENTS AND EVERYBODY LOOKED REALLY SILLY AT DANCES DANCING TO MUSIC THEY COULDN'T HEAR
HE STARTED SHAKING THE FLUTE TO GET THE FLIES OFF AND ACCIDENTALLY SMASHED IT INTO PIECES
THE FLIES WOULD LAND ALL OVER THE PEOPLE AND THEY COULDN'T SWAT AT THEM IT WAS GROSS THEN SUDDENLY THE FLIES FLEW AWAY FAST AS THEY COULD
LOOK JOHN I'VE HEARD YOU PLAY THE CLARINET YOU'RE QUITE GOOD WHY DON'T YOU PLAY THAT INSTEAD SAID CHIEF SANDERS
DOCTOR WONG THOUGHT FOR A SECOND THEN PRONOUNCED IT'S THE FLUTE SOUND THE FLIES HATE JOHN'S FLUTE PLAYING AS MUCH AS WE DO
THEN THE TOWN DECIDED TO HAVE A GREAT BIG PARADE IN FRANKSVILLE
THEY GOT TONS AND TONS OF FLIES THEN THE FLIES STOPPED
SO THEY DECIDED THAT JOHN COULD PLAY THE FLUTE AND EVERYBODY ELSE WOULD HAVE TO WEAR EARPLUGS
JOHN DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TO DO SO HE JUST KEPT ON PLAYING HIS FLUTE
HE PLAYED MANY MUSICAL INSTRUMENTS SUCH AS THE GUITAR THE TUBA THE PIANO AND THE CLARINET
BUT
BEFORE I TELL YOU HOW ROOSTER JOHN GOT HIS NAME YOU SHOULD KNOW A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE T TOWN OF FRANKSVILLE
STILL IT'S NOT AS BAD AS MILLIONS OF FLIES I SUPPOSE
THE POLICE CHIEF HATED THE SOUND SO MUCH THAT HE THREW JOHN IN JAIL
FROM THEN ON JOHN WOULD WAKE UP AT SUNRISE LIKE A ROOSTER AND PLAY TO KEEP THE FLIES AWAY
A BIG BAND BAND PLAYED AS THEY MARCHED UP AND DOWN MAIN STREET EVERYONE CHEERED
THEN THEY DECIDED TO LOWER HIM DOWN INTO A WELL AND LET HIM PLAY DOWN WHERE NO ONE COULD HEAR HIM
NO NO PLEASE DON'T PLAY YOUR OLD FLUTE BEGGED DOCTOR WONG
THE NEIGHBORS ARE COMPLAINING AND THE CATS AND DOGS ARE TRYING TO CHEW OFF THEIR EARS
BEFORE THEY KNEW IT THE TOWN WAS FILLED WITH FLIES AGAIN
THEY HAD TO COVER THEIR EARS FROM THE HORRIBLE SOUND
I DON'T KNOW WHY BUT I FEEL LIKE I HAVE TO DO TO OR ELSE BAD THINGS WILL HAPPEN
THANKFULLY SOMEONE WAS DIGGING A HOLE AND FOUND WATER BUT SOON AFTER THAT THEY STARTED TO GET FLIES
HE THOUGHT THAT IF HE MADE A NEW MOUTHPIECE ESPECIALLY SHAPED FOR JOHN'S MOUTH
WHAT SHOULD THEY DO THEY SHOULDN'T KEEP JOHN IN JAIL AND THEY DIDN'T WANT TO KICK HIM OUT OF TOWN BECAUSE THEY ALL HAD SUCH NICE TEETH
OH NO SAID CHIEF SANDERS JUST WHEN THINGS WERE GOING GOOD FOR FRANKSVILLE
ROOSTER JOHN
THAT'S HOW THE FLUTE SOUNDED WHEN THIS GUY PLAYED IT I'M SERIOUS
BECAUSE AS BAD AS THE FLUTE SOUNDED IT WAS A LOT BETTER THAN THOUSANDS OF FLIES CRAWLING ON THEM
THEN HE PLAYED THE SONG
BUT JUST TRY TO IMAGINE SOMEONE SCRATCHING ON A CHALKBOARD WITH A FORK AND THEN MULTIPLY THAT TIMES A HUNDRED
THEY WERE UP IN ON THE MAIN FLOAT
THEY JUST COULDN'T LEAD A NORMAL LIFE
WE CAN'T LET YOU PLAY THAT FLUTE ANYMORE JOHN SAID POLICE CHIEF SANDERS
HE WAS VERY UPSET AT FIRST THEN HE SAID OH WELL GOOD THING I BOUGHT BROUGHT MY OLD FLUTE AS AS BACK UP
JOHN THE DENTIST IS DRIVING THE FLIES AWAY
OH WHY THAT'S A NICE INSTRUMENT BUT IT'S JUST NOT THE FLUTE
BUT JUST THEN A MAN MOVED INTO TOWN WHO PLAYED THE FLUTE SO BADLY THAT PEOPLE WOULD RUN AWAY SCREAMING
TO CELEBRATE THE FACT THAT FOR ONCE THERE WAS NO WATER PROBLEM NO FLY PROBLEM AND NO FRUIT FLUTE PROBLEM
WELL I'M SURE YOU GUESSED THAT DIDN'T WORK
HOWEVER FOR SOME REASON THE WAY HIS MOUTH WAS SHAPED MADE HIS FLUTE SOUND AWFUL
THE FLIES WERE ANNOYING SO HE WOULD SWAT AT THEM WITH HIS HAND OR EVEN HIS NEW FLUTE
FRANKSVILLE WAS A TOWN THAT SEEMED TO HAVE ONE PROBLEM AFTER THE OTHER
BESIDES EVERYBODY LOVED JOHN SINCE HE HAD BECOME THE TOWN DENTIST EVERYBODY'S TEETH WERE MUCH WHITER AND CLEANER AND NO ONE HAD ANY CAVITIES
THE BAD FLUTE PLAYER WAS ROOSTER JOHN
BUT THEY COULDN'T KEEP JOHN IN JAIL SINCE HE WASN'T REALLY BREAKING ANY LAWS SO THERE WAS NOTHING THE POLICE COULD DO
THEN SUDDENLY A FLY LANDED ON A LITTLE GIRL
JOHN THOUGHT THAT WAS AN OK IDEA BUT THERE WAS AN ECHO IN THE WELL THAT MADE HIS FLUTE SOUND LOUDER
BUT IT WAS TOO LATE JOHN HAD STARTED PLAYING
DOWN DOWN BATMAN SUNK I'M FINISHED HE THOUGHT THERE'S NO WAY TO ESCAPE BUT JUST BEFORE BATMAN'S HEAD DISAPPEARED BELOW THE SAND A GREEN GLOVE HAND REACHED FOR HIM
BUT BATMAN WOULD SOON NEED HELP IN ANOTHER PART OF TOWN CRIMINAL GENIUS CALLED A RIDDLER A RIDDLER WAS ALSO PLOTTING AGAINST HIM
HE DISCOVERED AN UNDERGROUND C T CAVERN FILLED WITH CRIME FIGHTING EQUIPMENT DICK COULDN'T BELIEVE HIS EYES HE WAS INSIDE THE BATCAVE
YEAH
MOMENTS LATER HE TU HE RETURNED AS BATMAN TWO FACE SMILED BE BEGIN PA PASS TWO HE WHISPERED TO HIS GANG THEN HE RAN OUT TO THE STREET AND JUMPED INTO A NEARBY MOBLIE BATMAN FOLLOWED HIM
EASY MONEY THE HOODS SNEER SNEERED AS THEY KEPT UP ALONGSIDE HER THEY SNATCHED HER P PURSE AND RAN BUT AN INSTANT LATER A CAR CAME INTO A SCREECHING HALT IN FRONT OF THEM
BATMAN AND ROBIN AND SAID BATMAN I LIKE THE SOUND OF THAT FROM THEN ON BATMAN AND ROBIN WOULD BE PARTNERS TRACKING DOWN TWO FACE AND THE RIDDLER AND EVERY OTHER CRIMINAL IN GOTHAM CITY
IT WAS DICK HE HAD FOLLOWED BATMAN
WHEN HE WASN'T FIGHTING CRIME BATMAN HAD A SECRET IDENTITY HE WAS BRUCE WHALE THE WEALTHIEST MAN IN THE IN GOTHAM CITY
AL ALL RIGHT FOLKS THIS IS AN OLD FASHIONED STICK UP TWO FACE GR GROWLED AT THE TER TERRIFIED GUESTS HIS GANG MEMBERS WERE SO BUSY ROBBING EVERYONE THEY DIDN'T NOTICE BRUCE WAYNE SLIP OUT OF THE ROOM
THE HOODLUMS KNEW THEY WERE NO MATCH FOR BATMAN BUT WHEN THE TOP OF THE BATMOBILE OPENED THEY WERE SURPRISED TO SEE A YOUNG MAN
BATMAN WAS THE GREATEST CRIME FIGHTER IN THE GOTHAM CITY WHENEVER CRIMES TRIED TO BREAK THE LAW BATMAN WAS THERE TO STOP THEM
DICK LIVED DICK LIKED LIVING IN THE IN THE MANSION BUT HE WO BUT HE WONDERED WHERE BRUCE WENT EVERY EVENING LATE ONE NIGHT DICK WENT SEARCHING FOR A CLUE

OKAY PARTNER WE HAVE A DEAL TWO FACE SAID WHAT'S THE PLAN
I EXPECT YOU'LL BE BURNED ALIVE TWO FACE SAID AS BATMAN SANK DEEPER I'D LOVE TO STAY AND SEE YOU OFF BUT CRIME'S A WASTIN' AND I'M A VERY BUSY MAN THEN TWO FACE WALKED AWAY
DICK SMILED MY FOLKS USED TO SAY I FLEW LIKE A BIRD ON THE FLYING TRAPEZE SO THEY'LL CALLED ME ROBIN
YOU WERE ON MY TRAIL TWO FACE SNARLED BUT IT WAS A BUT IT WAS ALL A TRAP TWO FACE POINTED HIS WEAPON AT BATMAN AND FIRED
WITH HIS LAST OUNCE OF STRENGTH BATMAN GRABBED THE THE HAND IT AN INSTANT LATER HE FELT HIMSELF BEING YANKED UP AND OUT OF THE PIT
BUT DICK QUICKLY PROVED THEM WRONG HE HAD SPENT YEARS TRAINING AS AN ACROBAT HE LEAPED AND
THE FOLLOWING NIGHT TWO FACE ARRIVED AT THE PARTY RIGHT ON SCHEDULE
TWO FACE TWO FACE WAS ONE OF THE CRIMINALS BATMAN HAD NOT CAUGHT YET TWO FACE AND HIS GANG COMMITTED CRIMES ALL OVER GOTHAM CITY THEY WORKED SO QUICKLY NO ONE COULD KEEP UP WITH THEM BATMAN WAS ONLY ONE MAN TO STOP TWO FACE HE W HE WOULD NEED HELP
WHILE THE RIDDLER HAD THE BRAINS TO WITH OUTWIT THE BATMAN HE DIDN'T HAVE THE MUSCLE TO
TWO TWO FACE'S WEAPON SENT A FIREBALL HURTLING
AND THERE WAS THE BATMOBILE IT COULD ONLY MEAN ONE THING BRUCE WAYNE WAS BATMAN
YOU'LL BE OKAY NOW DICK TOLD THE WOMAN AN THEN

THE RIDDLER TACKED DOWN TWO FACE AND MADE AN OFFER TWO FACE DECIDED TO FLIP A COIN IF IT COMES UP HEADS WE'LL JOIN FORCES HE COM HE EXPLAINED THE COIN HIT THE GROUND LANDING HEADS UP
MEANWHILE THE EXPLOSION FIREBALL SHATTERED THE TURNING THE TUNNEL WALLS STONE AND STEEL BEGAN TO RAIN ON BATMAN AND HE WAS GROUND BENEATH HIS FEET COLLASPED COLLAPSED BATMAN FELT H HIMSELF SINKING
IT WAS NO ORDINARY CAR IT WAS THE BATMOBILE OH NO ONE OF THE HOODS SCREAMED IT'S BATMAN

AFTER

SENT BALL HURTLING TOWARD BATMAN ACTING QUICKLY BATMAN PRESSED A BUTTON ON HIS UTILITY JET INSTANTLY HIS COSTUME WAS COVERED WITH A FIRE PROOF COATING THE BALL OF FLAME HIT HIM FULL BLAST BUT BATMAN WAS PROTECTED
MEANWHILE ACROSS TOWN A GANG OF THUGS HAD SPOTTED A WOMAN WALKING DOWN THE LONELY STREET OF GOTHAM CITY
LOOK ONE OF THE COOKS SHOUTED CROOKS SHOUTED IT ISN'T BATMAN IT'S JUST A KID WE CAN TAKE HIM EASY
YOU'RE TOO YOUNG BATMAN ANSWERED BESIDES BATMAN FIGHTS ALONE
HE DISCOVERED A SECRET DOOR THAT LED TO THE TO A F FLIGHT OF STAIRS DICK FOLLOWED THE ST FOLLOWED THE STAIRS DOWN INTO THE DARKNESS
A HAND GRABBED HIM AND TOSSED HIM TO THE BATMOBILE IT WAS BATMAN AND HE WAS ANGRY WHY CAN'T WE FIGHT CRIME TOGETHER DICK ASKED BATMAN AND AS THEY DROVE BACK TO THE W WA WAYNE MANOR
OKAY BATMAN SAID YOU YOU'VE EARNED IT BUT WHAT ARE WE GOING TO CALL YOU
YOU THOUGHT YOU
TOMORROW ALL OF GOTHAM'S RICHEST PEOPLE WILL BE AT A BIG PARTY THE RIDDLER EXPLAINED YOU'LL CRASH THE PARTY AND ROB THE GUESTS WHEN BATMAN ARRIVES YOU'LL S TO STOP YOU HE'LL WALK RIGHT INTO OUT TRAP
BY NOW ALL THE TURTLES WERE USUALLY WAY AHEAD OF MUD BUT THIS TIME SWISH WAS JUST AS SLOW
SINCE IT WOULD HAVE TO TAKE HIM MONTHS TO GET TO THE GREAT POND BY HIMSELF
THE MAYOR OF GREAT POND MRS TORT POSTED THE RULES OF THE RACE ON A TREE FOR EVERYONE TO SEE
SWISH STARTED YAWNING
SWISH'S MOTHER SMILED AND SAID I KNOW THAT YOU CAN WIN SWISH BUT IT'S AN HONOR JUST TO GET TO RACE SAID SWISH MOTHER
ALL THE TURTLES IN BLUE POND HELD A MEETING TO D TO DISCUSS THE PROBLEM
THE TURTLES ALL STRETCHED AND THOUGHT REALLY THOUGHT REALLY SLOW THOUGHTS
WHEN ALL THE TURTLES ARRIVED THERE W WAS A SEVEN DAY FESTIVAL CALLED THE SHELL DWELLERS FESTIVAL
THE MAYOR DOCTOR SOFTSHELL SAID THIS IS RIDICULOUS SWISH HAS TO RACE HE'S THE SLOWEST TURTLE I'VE EVERY SEEN EXCEPT FOR MUD OF COURSE
SWISH TOOK THE CUP THAT D CUP THAT DAY FOR THE FIRST TIME
BUT AS HE GOT A LITTLE OLDER THE TURTLES BEGAN TO REALIZE THAT SWISH WAS REALLY REALLY REALLY SLOW
SWISH WAS SAD THAT HE LOST BUT ALL THE TURTLES FROM BLUE POND CHEERED FOR SWISH
THIS WAS THE MOST FAMOUS TURTLE THERE WAS
MUD DIDN'T ANSWER IN FACT MUD WAS SOUND ASLEEP
EVEN I WAS FASTER THAN YOU WHEN I WAS YOUR AGE YOU'RE CHEATING YOU'RE GOING TO RUIN THE GREAT RACE FOREVER
HE PUT THE EARPLUGS IN HIS EARS AND HE COULD HEAR MUD'S SINGING ANY HE COULDN'T HEAR MUD SINGING ANYMORE
ALL THE TURTLES WERE VERY VERY SLOW SO IT TOOK THEM TIME BEFORE ANYONE COULD FIGURE OUT WHICH TURTLE WERE THE SLOWEST
AFTER A FEW HOURS MOST OF THE TURTLES HAVE OR HAD GONE A FEW FEET ALL EXCEPT TWO
THE WINNER OF THE GREAT TURTLE RACE WAS SO IMPORTANT THAT HE OR SHE DIDN'T HAVE TO MOVE FOR FOUR YEARS UNTIL THE NEXT FESTIVAL
BUT THOUGH HE BECAME THE GREATEST AND THE BIGGEST TURTLE ALL MUCH GREATER OR BIGGER THAN MUD
WE NEVER THOUGHT OF THAT THEY ALL THEY S THEY ALL SAID
SHE ANNOUNCED WELL MUD IT LOOKS LIKE YOU'VE DONE IT AGAIN SLUDGE POND WINS THE TURTLE CUP AGAIN
SO WITH SWISH THEY THOUGHT MAYBE JUST MAYBE HE COULD BRING BACK THE TURTLE CUP TO THEIR THEIR LITTLE POND
SWISHES FATHER SAID SON I HAVE SOMETHING TO TELL YOU
IT WAS RUMORED HE WAS SO SLOW HIS HEART WOULD ONLY BEAT ONCE A DAY
YOU'LL YOU'LL GET TO MEET ALL SORTS OF NEW TURTLES
THE REAL WINNER IS SWISH SOFTBELLY OF BLUE POND THE CROWD WENT WILD
HE THOUGHT SURE THEY ARE NICE TO ME BUT BECAUSE THEY THINK I CAN WIN THE RACE BUT IF I LOSE THEY'LL BE DISAPPOINTED AND MAD AT ME
RULE NUMBER FOUR DO NO TURTLE MAY FALL ASLEEP SINCE IF YOU ARE ASLEEP YOU AREN'T RUNNING AS FAST AS YOU CAN
WHO WAS THIS WHO IS THIS YOUNG PUNK HE THOUGHT TO HIMSELF
RULE NUMBER TWO ALL TURTLES MUST RUN AS FAST AS THEY CAN AND THE TURTLES THAT THAT IS CLOSEST TO THE STARTING LINE WINS
THEN HE SNAPPED OUT OF IT AND REMEMBERED HIS FATHERS FATHER HAD WARNED HIM OF HIS TRICKS
HOW COME THEY DON'T MOVE THAT BIG ROCK OUT OF THE FIELD IT SEEMS TO BE EVERYONE'S WAY SAID SWISH
THEY LOOKED AT THE HORIZON AND SAW THE SUN WAS STARTING UHM STARTING THE RISE
TURTLES COULD CATCH UP WITH FRIENDS THEY HAD NOT SEEN SINCE THE LAST FESTIVAL
IT WAS BECAUSE OF SWISH THAT BLUE POND BECAME THE MOST RESPECTED POND IN THE LAND
BUT HE DOESN'T WANT TO BE TREATED SPECIAL HE JUST WANTS TO BE NORMAL AND HE DOESN'T WANT EVERYBODY TO HATE HIM IF HE CAN'T BEAT MUD
SWISH WAS H WAS HAPPY TOO BUT DEEP DOWN INSIDE HE KNEW HE WAS JUST AS SLOW AS MUD
BLUE POND WAS A NICE VILLAGE LOCATED ABOUT THREE DAYS CRAWL FROM THE GREAT POND
THAT'S NOT A ROCK SWEETIE HIS MOTHER SAID THAT'S MUD
HE WAS THE BIGGEST MOST RESPECTED AND ALSO ONE OF THE TRICKIEST TURTLES THERE WAS
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN SHE SAID MUD MUD FROM SLUDGE POND HAS BEEN DISQUALIFIED FOR SLEEPING DURING THE RACE
THIS WAS THE KIND OF THING THAT SWISH WOULD GET ALL THE TIME
EVERY FOUR YEARS TURTLES FROM ALL OVER THE LAND WOULD CRAWL TO THE GREAT POND
THE TURTLE'S NAME SWISH
OH NO SHOUTED THE FANS MUD'S WINNING IT LOOKS LIKE MUD IS STILL THE GREATEST TURTLE OF THEM ALL
THE TURTLE CUP WAS THE TROPHY THAT THE WINNER WOULD TAKE HOME TO THEIR VILLAGE
THE CROWD STARTED YELLING SPEECH SPEECH
THE CROWD THOUGHT HE HAD HE MUST HAVE REALIZED THAT HIS SINGING TRICK WASN'T WORKING
IT LOOKED AS IF NEITHER OF THEM HAD MOVED AT ALL THEY WERE BOTH MOVING OF COURSE BUT THEY WERE SO SLOW THAT IT WAS HARD TO TELL
LIKE LIKE A TURTLE WITH HONOR
WHEN THE TIME OF THE FESTIVAL DREW NEAR ALL THE TURTLES IN THE LAND STARTED TOWARD GREAT POND
WHAT WOULD YOU LIKE TO SAY TO ALL THE TURTLES AT THE FESTIVAL
FOR EXAMPLE MISTER PEEKS THE LOCAL SHELL CLEANER WOULD SAY HEY THERE SWISH DO YOU WANT A FREE SHELL WAXING TODAY
THEN HE WHISPERED IN SWISH'S EAR ALL THE TRICKS THAT HIS GREAT GREAT GRAND TURTLE TAUGHT HIM
WHEN MUD WAS IN HIS PRIME THERE WAS A NEW TURTLE BORN IN BLUE POND
TURTLES NEVER CHEAT AND I'M A TURTLE WITH HONOR
HE TOLD HIS MOTHER YOU KNOW WHAT I'M GOING TO WIN THIS RACE I KNOW IT AND ALL THESE AND ALL THESE TURTLES WILL KNOW THAT BLUE POND RULES
SHE SAID SWISH YOU ARE THE YOUNGEST WINNER OF THE GREAT TURTLE RACE THAT WAS THE MOST EXCITING FINISH WE'VE EVER HAD
I HEARD ONCE IT TOOK HIM THREE DAYS JUST TO YAWN
THE SLOWEST TURTLES FROM EACH POND WERE CARRIED TO THE STARTING LINE BY MEMBERS OF THEIR VILLAGE
FINALLY AFTER THE LONG JOURNEY ALL THE TURTLES ARRIVED AT GREAT POND
MUD KNEW THAT THIS WOULD BE HIS CLOSEST RACE EVER AND HE WAS ACTUALLY GETTING A LITTLE BIT SCARED
THEY READ RULE NUMBER ONE THE GREAT RACE BEGINS AT SUNRISE AND ENDS AT SUNSET
SWISH SAW A ROCK IN THE MIDDLE OF THE FIELD AND WONDERED
HE WAS TIRED FROM RACING AND THOUGHT HE IT WOULD BE NICE TO JUST LISTEN TO MUD'S SWEET VOICE AND FALL ASLEEP
AS THEY DID THIS AS THEY DID THE SKY TURNED FROM BLACK TO DARK BLUE
HE HE WOULD TAKE IT MANY MORE TIMES AFTER THAT
WITHOUT HIM WE DON'T HAVE A CHANCE
WHERE THERE THERE WAS LOTS OF E EATING AND LAUGHING
ONCE HIS MOTHER CALLED HIM IN FOR DINNER AND HE T AND DIDN'T MAKE IT HOME UNTIL BREAKFAST THE NEXT MORNING AND HE WAS ONLY A FOOT AWAY
THEY WERE VERY PROUD HE GAVE MUD SUCH A CLOSE RACE
MISTER PEEKS WOULD NEVER DO ANYTHING FOR FREE BUT HE WAS G GOING TO GIVE SWISH A FREE SHELL WAXING
MUD HAD ACTUALLY SUNG HIMSELF TO SLEEP
THE SLOWEST T TURTLE
BUT THEN RIGHT AT THE END RIGHT BEFORE THE SUNSET SWISH STARTED TO PULL AHEAD OF MUD
SO YOU SO YOU CAN SEE WINNING THE GREAT RACE IS A GREAT HONOR
BUT SWISH D DIDN'T LET MUD SCARE HIM
MUD KEPT SINGING HIS LULLABY FOR A FEW HOURS BUT HE STOPPED RIGHT BEFORE SUNSET
HE ALWAYS THOUGHT SURE THAT NO ONE TREATED HIM SPECIAL AND THAT HE TREATED EVERYBODY LIKE HE WANTED TO BE TREATED
THE TOWN AGREED TO TREAT SWISH LIKE A NORMAL TURTLE AND AFTER A WHILE SWISH DECIDED THAT HE WOULD BE PROUD TO RACE FOR HIS VILLAGE
SWISH AND MUD WERE BOTH BACK AT THE STARTING LINE
THE THE LEAST A TURTLE MOVES THE BIGGER THEY GET AND THE LONGER THEY LIVE
AS YOU KNOW YOUR GREAT GREAT GRAND TURTLE RACED MUD ONCE HE WASN'T AS SLOW AS YOU BUT HE DID TEACH ME ABOUT MUD'S DIRTY TRICKS
THIS TIME IT WAS A BIT CLOSER THAN YOU WOULD HAVE LIKED I'LL BET
EVERYONE TREATED SWISH DIFFERENTLY
WISH WAS SUDDENLY VERY EXCITED
YOU'RE JUST TRYING TO TO MAKE ME QUIT I'M NOT GOING TO FALL FOR YOUR TRICKS HE SAID
SWISH READ THE R RULES EVEN THOUGH HE KNEW THEM BY HEART THEN HE HEARD THE MAYOR SAY RUNNER'S TAKE PLEASE TAKE YOUR POSITIONS
MRS TORT WENT UP TO SWISH AND GAVE HIM THE TURTLE CUP
I WOULD NEVER PROMISED THAT I WOULD WIN THE RACE I CAN'T BEAT MUD ANYWAY
MUD SAID TO SWISH THERE'S NO WAY THAT A TURTLE AS YOUNG AS YOU CAN BE SO SLOW
RULE NUMBER THREE NO TURTLE MAY PRETEND TO BE GOING FAST BUT GO SLOW INSTEAD ALL TURTLE MUST GO AS FAST AS THEY CAN AT ALL TIMES
HE REACHED HIS SHELL AND PULLED OUT A COUPLE OF EARPLUGS
JUST THEN THE MAYOR SAID READY SET SLOW AND OFF THEY WENT
HE WOULD NEVER LOSE THE TURTLE CUP FOR THE REST OF HIS LIFE
YOU HAVE TO REMEMBER THAT EVEN THOUGH HE'S GIFTED AT BEING SLOW HE'S STILL VERY YOUNG SAID SWISH SWISH FATHER
EVERYTHING ABOUT THE FESTIVAL WAS FUN BUT THE MAIN EVENT WAS THE GREAT TURTLE RACE
SWISH MADE A LOUD GULP SOUND JUST DO YOUR BEST SAID HIS MOTH MOM
THE MAYOR OF PONDLAND WENT TO PRESENT THE TURTLE CUP TO SLUDGE POND AGAIN
THEY ALL FELT A LITTLE SAD BECAUSE THEY HADN'T HELD THE TURTLE CUP IN OVER A SEVEN HUNDRED YEARS
LOOK THERE'S YOUR COUSIN PEEK A BOO FROM 'BIG PUDDLES' VILLAGE SAID SWISH MOTHER SWISH MOTHER
THERE WERE THERE WERE MANY LEGENDS ABOUT HIM
SINCE TURTLES NEVER CHEAT THIS IS THE MOST IMPORTANT RULE TO BREAK THIS RULE WOULD MEAN AN END TO THE GREAT TURTLE RACE FOREVER
THIS MEANS THAT WE HAVE A NEWS CHAMPION
ALL THE EXTRA ATTENTION MADE SWISH VERY UNCOMFORTABLE
FOR THE FIRST TIME IN SIX HUNDRED YEARS I WOULD LIKE TO PRESENT THE TURTLE CUP TO BLUE POND THE CROWD WENT WILD AGAIN
IT WOULD TAKE SOME TURTLES FROM FAR AWAY VILLAGE TWO TWO WHOLE WEEKS JUST TO GET THERE
WHEN SWISH WAS BORN EVERYONE THOUGHT HE WAS A SLOW T LITTLE SLOW
THEN THE SUN WENT DOWN MUD WAS THE CLOSEST TURTLE TO THE STARTING LINE
IT HAD BEEN IN SLUDGE POND FOR OVER FIFTY YEARS BECAUSE NO ONE COULD EVER BEAT THEIR TURTLE
MRS SNAPPER WOULD SAY HI HI SWISHY DO YOU WANT SOME YUMMY PIE TO FILL YOU UP AND S AND SLOW YOU DOWN FOR THE BIG RACE A FAT TURTLE IS A SLOW TURTLE
MUD DIDN'T ANSWER THE MAYOR TAPPED MUD ON THE SHELL AND SAID HELLO HELLO MUD
SWISH HAD A HAD TO BE CARRIED ON HIS FATHER'S BACK
AFTER SIX HOURS MUD AND SWISH WERE STILL TI TI TIED AND HAD ONLY MOVED A FEW INCHES
AFTER SEVEN DAYS OF PLAYING AND DANCING AND BUG EATING FINALLY THE DAY OF THE RACE CAME
WE ALL WANT YOU TO LOOK GOOD WHEN YOU BRING HOME THE CUP
I'M NOT AFRAID OF STUPID MUD MUD
THEN MUD TRIED ANOTHER TRICK HE STARTED SINGING A SOFT BEAUTIFUL LULLABY
THERE WERE ABOUT THREE HUNDRED TURTLES RACING THEY WERE ALL THE S ALL THE SLOWEST OF THE SLOW
I THINK THAT YOU'LL BE THE GREATEST CHAMPION FOR MANY YEARS SINCE TURTLES ONLY GET SLOWER WITH AGE
SO ONE DAY HE TOLD HIS PARENTS I DON'T WANT TO RACE
THEN FLIES WERE ANNOYING THE FLIES WERE ANNOYING SO HE WOULD SWAT THEM ALL WITH HIS HANDS OR EVEN HIS NEW FLUTE
THEN THEY DECIDED TO LOWER HIM DOWN A WELL AND LET HIM PLAY DOWN WHERE NO ONE COULD HEAR HIM
JOHN'S DENTIST WAS DRIVING THE FLIES AWAY
DOCTOR WONG AND JOHN WERE THE STARS OF THE PARADE THEY WERE UP IN THE MAIN FLOAT
THE BAD FLUTE PLAYER WAS ROOSTER JOHN HE WASN'T CALLED ROOSTER JOHN YET THAT CAME LATER
SO THERE WAS A PROBLEM IN THE LITTLE TOWN OF FRANKSVILLE
OH THAT'S A NICE INSTRUMENT BUT IT JUST NOT THE FLUTE I EVEN WROTE YOU A SONG CHIEF SANDERS IT'S CALLED COPS AND ROBBERS
JOHN THOUGHT THAT WAS THAT WAS AN OK IDEA BUT THERE WAS AN ECHO IN THE WELL THAT MADE THE FLUTE SOUND LOUDER
THEIR PROBLEMS STARTED WHEN THEY RAN OUT OF WATER
OH NO CRIED CHIEF CHERUB
NO ONE COULD HEAR ANYTHING PEOPLE WERE GETTING INTO CAR ACCIDENTS AND EVERYBODY LOOKED REALLY SILLY AT DANCES DANCING TO MUSIC THEY COULDN'T HEAR
AND GUESS WHAT IT WORKED DOCTOR WONG WAS THE TOWN HERO THE FLUTE SOUNDED NORMAL AND IT TURNED OUT JOHN COULD PLAY IT QUITE WELL
HE WAS VERY UPSET AT FIRST THEN HE SAID OH WELL GOOD THING I BROUGHT MY OLD FLUTE AS BACK UP
BECAUSE AS BAD AS THE FLUTE SOUNDED IT WAS A LOT BETTER THAN THOUSANDS OF FLIES CRAWLING ON THEM
HE PLAYED MANY MUSICAL INSTRUMENTS SUCH AS THE GUITAR THE TUBA THE PIANO AND THE CLARINET
THEN A FLY LANDED ON SOMEONE ELSE
SO THEY DECIDED THAT JOHN COULD PLAY THE FLUTE AND EVERYBODY ELSE WOULD HAVE TO WEAR EARPLUGS
NO NO PLEASE DON'T PLAY YOUR OLD FLUTE BEGGED DOCTOR WONG BUT IT WAS TOO LATE JOHN HAD STARTED PLAYING
THE LOCAL DENTIST DOCTOR WONG CAME UP WITH AN IDEA
THAT'S HOW THE FLUTE SOUNDED WHEN THIS GUY PLAYED IT I'M SERIOUS
BUT I HAVE TO PLAY I WAS BORN TO DO IT I DON'T KNOW WHY BUT I FEEL LIKE I HAVE TO OR ELSE BAD THINGS WILL HAPPEN
BEFORE I TELL YOU HOW ROOSTER JOHN GOT HIS NAME YOU SHOULD KNOW A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE TOWN OF FRANKSVILLE
THE NEIGHBORS ARE COMPLAINING AND THE CATS AND DOGS ARE TRYING TO CHEW OFF THEIR EARS
UHM OH NO SAID CHIEF SANDERS JUST WHEN THINGS WERE GO GOING GOOD FOR FRANKSVILLE
BUT THEY COULDN'T KEEP JOHN IN JAIL SINCE HE WASN'T REALLY BREAKING ANY LAWS
THE FLIES WOULD LAND ALL OVER THE PEOPLE AND THEY COULDN'T SWAT THEM OFF IT WAS GROSS THEN SUDDENLY THE FLIES FLEW AWAY FAST AS THEY COULD
HE STARTED SHAKING THE FLUTE TO GET THE FLIES OFF AND ACCIDENTALLY SMASHED IT INTO PIECES
IT WAS THEN THAT PEOPLE OF FRANKSVILLE REALIZED THAT THEY WOULD HAVE TO TAKE A GOOD WITH TAKE THE GOOD WITH THE BAD
A BIG BAND PLAYED AS THEY MARCHED UP AND DOWN MAIN STREET EVERYONE CHEERED
THEN SUDDENLY A FLY LANDED ON THE A LITTLE GIRL
HE WAS THE NEW TOWN DENTIST HE WAS AN EXCELLENT DENTIST BUT HIS REAL LOVE WAS MUSIC
WHAT SHOULD THEY DO THEY COULDN'T KEEP JOHN IN JAIL AND THEY DIDN'T WANT TO KICK HIM OUT OF THE OF TOWN BECAUSE THEY ALL HAD SUCH NICE TEETH
THEN HE PLAYED THE SONG THE POLICE CH CH CH CHE UH
THANKFULLY SOMEONE WAS DIGGING A HOLE AND FOUND WATER BUT SOON AFTER THEY STARTED TO GET FLIES
WINDOWS WERE BREAKING ALL THE COWS IN TOWN STARTED TO MAKE SOUR MILK
MAYBE A POORLY PLAYED FLUTE DOESN'T SOUND AT ALL THAT BAD BUT JUST TRY TO IMAGINE SOMEONE SCRATCHING A CHALKBOARD WITH A FORK AND THEN MULTIPLYING THAT TIMES A HUNDRED
ROOSTER JOHN
WE CAN'T LET YOU PLAY THE FLUTE ANYMORE JOHN SAID POLICE SHERIFF SANDERS
THEY JUST COULDN'T
THEY HAD TO COVER THEIR EARS FROM THE HORRIBLE SOUND
THE POLICE CHIEF HATED THE SOUND SO MUCH THAT HE THREW JOHN IN JAIL
THEN THE FLIES STOPPED BUT JUST THEN A MAN MOVED INTO TOWN WHO PLAYED THE FLUTE SO BADLY THAT PEOPLE WOULD RUN AWAY SCREAMING
THE PEOPLE IN TOWN DECIDED TO HAVE A GREAT BIG PARADE IN FRANKSVILLE AND CELEBRATE THE FACT THAT FOR NO
FROM THEN ON JOHN WOULD WAKE UP AT SUNRISE LIKE A ROOSTER AND PLAY TO KEEP H THE FLIES AWAY
THEN SOME LANDED ON A BUNCH OF PEOPLE AND PRETTY SOON TONS OF FLIES WERE LANDING ON EVERYONE BUT BEFORE THEY KNEW IT THE TOWN WAS FILLED WITH FLIES AGAIN
HOWEVER FOR SOME REASON THE WAY HIS MOUTH WAS SHAPED MADE HIS FLUTE SOUND AWFUL
WELL I'M SURE YOU GUESSED THAT DIDN'T WORK
WHEN THE TOWNSFOLK HEARD THE NOISE THEY COULDN'T EVEN SWAT THE FLIES ANYMORE
UHM
THEY GOT TONS AND TONS OF FLIES
HE THOUGHT THAT IF HE MADE A NEW MOUTHPIECE ESPECIALLY SHAPED FOR JOHN'S MOUTH THEN PERHAPS HE COULD PLAY THE FLUTE NORMALLY
STILL IT'S NOT AS BAD AS MILLIONS OF FLIES I SUPPOSE
BESIDES EVERYBODY LOVED JOHN SINCE HE HAD BECOME THE TOWN DENTIST EVERYBODY'S TEETH WERE MUCH WHITER AND CLEANER AND NO ONE HAD ANY CAVITIES
LOOK JOHN I'VE HEARD YOU PLAY THE CLARINET YOU'RE QUITE GOOD WHY DON'T YOU PLAY THAT INSTEAD SAID CHIEF SANDER SANDERS
FRANKSVILLE WAS A TOWN THAT SEEMED TO HAVE ONE PROBLEM AFTER THE OTHER
JOHN DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TO DO SO HE JUST KEPT ON PLAYING HIS FLUTE
LEAD A NORMAL LIFE
DOCTOR WONG THOUGHT FOR A SECOND THEN PRONOUNCED IT'S THE FLUTE SOUND THE FLIES HATE JOHN'S FLUTE PLAYING AS MUCH AS WE DO
SO THERE WAS NOTHING THE POLICE COULD DO
FOR ONCE THERE WAS NO WATER PROBLEM NO FLY FLY PROBLEM AND NO FLUTE PROBLEM
HOW TO TURN YOUR HEAD ALL THE WAY AROUND WITH GETTING A TERRIBLE PAIN IN YOUR NECK SAID OWL
YES BUT WHAT DOES THAT HAVE TO DO WITH THE PANDAS MAN SAID THE ZOO PE ZOO KEEPER WELL IT SEEMS TO ME SIR THAT YIN YIN WANTED TO BE A GREAT EXPLORER AND INSTEAD BECAME A BUSINESS WOMAN
BUT AFTER HE FELL ASLEEP HE DID MANAGE TO SAY I BELIEVE ROLLING IS A DECIDEDLY ROUND ABOUT WAY TO GO IF YOU MUST GO IT IT IT T'WOULD BE THE BEST TO FLY
IT IS INTERESTING TO POINT OUT AT THIS TIME THAT MORE S STUFFED PANDA BEARS ARE SOLD AT ZOO GIFT SHOPS THEN ALL OF THE OTHER STUFF ANIMALS COMBINED
HE DIDN'T MIND HANDLING THE RAW MEAT HE HAD TO FEED TO THE TIGERS HIS MAIN OBJECTION WAS TO BEING EATEN
THE OWL INSTANTLY REPLIED TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND AND SEVENTY SIX GIVE OR TAKE TWO A WEEK LATER MAGGIE MANAGED TO ROUND UP TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND AND SEVENTY EIGHT MAGPIES SHE COULD BE A VERY PERSUASIVE LITTLE BIRD WHEN SHE WANTED
BESIDES IF YOU LEAVE I'LL GET TERRIBLY OUT OF SHAPE NOW IF YOU EXCUSE ME I NEED TO SQUEEZE SOMETHING BEFORE I CAN SCREAM BUT YIN YIN AND THE YOUNG PANDA WAS NOT LISTENING TO FRED
ONE TWO THREE TO THE MOON THEY ALL THEY SAID TOGETHER PULLING WITH ALL THEIR MIGHT I SEE YOUR WINGS FLAPPING BUT WE DON'T SEEM TO BE GOING ANYWHERE SAID YIN YIN
I KNOW I SHOULDN'T BE TELLING YOU THIS BUT WE MIGHT HAVE TO SELL YOU AND YOUR FAMILY TO THE BIG ZOO IN SAN ANGELES IF WE DON'T GET MORE MONEY
THERE WERE THREE PANDAS AND THEY WERE KNOWN AS THE PAN FAMILY THEY WERE IN ORDER OF CUTENESS YIN YIN THE YOUNG DAUGHTER POO POO THE MOTHER AND MOO MAN THE GENTLE AND ALWAYS SLEEPY FATHER
IT'S TAKEN ME A COUPLE OF WEEKS TO FIGURE IT OUT BUT I THINK YIN YIN WANTS TO GO TO THE MOON AND MAGPIES WANT TO TAKE HER SAID FRED
ENOUGH OF THIS NONSENSE SAID YIN YIN'S MOTHER POO POO WHAT SORT OF NONSENSE IS THIS FOR A YOUNG PANDA BEAR
YIN YIN WAS ALWAYS ONE TO TAKE GOOD ADVICE FROM HER FATHER AND LESS THAN A WEEK LATER YIN YIN AND MAGGIE HAD BUILT A ROCKET SHIP OUT OF BAMBOO BAMBOO IS VERY WORKABLE SUBSTANCE AND PANDAS TEND TO HANDLE BAMBOO A LOT SO THAT SO THAT THIS IN ITSELF WAS NOT THAT ASTONISHING AT LEAST TO THE YIN YINS PARENTS FRED SURE WAS IMPRESSED THOUGH
BUT EVERYTHING WAS NOT ALL BAMBOO AND HUGS AT THE ZOO
BACK IN THE PANDA'S HOME THE MOTHER PANDA POO POO WAS VERY PROUD OF HER DAUGHTER AFTER ALL IF IT WEREN'T FOR YIN YIN THEY WOULD HAVE TO MOVE TH THEY WOULD HAVE THEY WOULD HAVE HAD TO MOVE THEIR WONDERFUL HOME BUT LATER WHEN FRED WALKED INTO THE PANDA'S HOME UNDER HIS NEW YELLOW UMBRELLA ALL SHE COULD THINK TO SAY WAS NONSENSE
SOME PEOPLE DO LIKE TO BITE THEIR FINGER NAILS BUT FRED WASN'T A NAIL BITER SO BEING EATEN WAS DEFINITELY NOT SOMETHING HE LOOKED FORWARD TO EACH AFTERNOON AT THREE O'CLOCK WHEN IT WAS TIME TO FEED THE TIGERS
NOW WHILE ALL THIS WAS GOING ON WHAT DO YOU SUPPOSED FRED WAS DOING
YIN YIN AND HER BEST FRIEND MAGGIE THE MAGPIE WHO LOOKED A LOT LIKE A PANDA WOULD LOOK IF PANDAS WERE BIRDS WERE DISCUSSING ABOUT GOING TO THE MOON
IT WAS A LAW OF NATURE IN FURTHER DISTANCES PANDAS HAVE A STRANGE ALMOST MAGICAL EFFECT ON HUMAN BEINGS WHICH MAKES US WANT TO HUG AND SQUEEZE THINGS
WHY DID A PANDA WITH THE BEAUTIFUL GIRL NAME YIN YIN HAVE HER NAME CHANGED TO THE VERY UN BEAUTIFUL GIRL NAME COLUMBUS
SAID IT COSTS SO MUCH TO FEED YOUR PA PANDA BEARS I WOULD HATE IF YOU HAD TO LEAVE US AFTER ALL IT'S ONLY THE HOME YOU KNOW
THE FATHER WATCHING THIS ALL THROUGH ONE EYE FOR HE ALWAYS HAD AT LEAST ONE EYE ASLEEP AT ALL TIMES SAID T'WOULD BE THE BEST TO ASK THE OWL THEN CLOSED HIS EYE
FRED WAS STARTING TO FEEL THE UNCONTROLLABLE URGE TO HUG THE PANDA SO BEFORE HE RAN OFF TO HUG THE PALM TREE QUICKLY
FRED THOUGHT ABOUT IT AND SAID YOU KNOW I THINK WE SHOULD RENAME YIN YIN COLUMBUS THE ZOO KEEPER SAID GOOD HEAVENS MAN THAT IS A GREAT IDEA NO WAIT A SECOND I DON'T UNDERSTAND WELL SIR
IT'S SIMPLE ECONOMICS LIKE LIKE IT WE'RE NOT WE ARE SPOKESPEOPLE FOR THE PANDA STUFFED ANIMAL INDUSTRY WHICH YOUNG LADY HELPS PAY FOR THE BAMBOO B THAT YOU EAT SUCH NONSENSE GOING TO THE MOON SAID HER MOTHER POO POO
I SEE FRED ONE MORE ONE MORE THING SIR ABOUT THOSE MAGPIES FLYING ABOVE THE PANDAS DO YOU THINK THAT THE ZOO COULD PURCHASE ME A LARGE SIZED UMBRELLA
NONSENSE SAID THE MOTHER I'M SO MAD I'M GOING TO LOOK AT THAT LADY OVER THERE AND MAKE HER WANT TO SQUEEZE HER SON CHEEKS HE SAID SPITEFULLY AN INSTANT LATER A YOUNG BOY WAS HEARD SAYING OUCH MOM CUT THAT OUT I'M SORRY TO SAY BUT MANY A LITTLE BOY'S CHEEKS HAVE BEEN MADE RAW WHEN MOTHER POO POO PANDA WAS UPSET
THE ZOO MANAGER LAUGHED AND WALKED AWAY BUT DID PURCHASE A FASHIONABLE YELLOW UMBRELLA FOR FRED THE NEXT DAY
THIS CAN ALMOST CERTAINLY BE ACCOUNTED FOR BY THIS STRANGE ALMOST MAGICAL EFFECT THAT THE PANDAS POSSESS
A WEEK LATER DESPITE MUCH FLAPPING THEY WERE STILL TRYING AND TO GET THE ROCKET IN THE AIR IT TURNS OUT THAT THE OWL DIDN'T TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION THAT ONCE YOU GET OVER ONE THOUSAND MAGPIE TOGETHER THEY TEND TO FIGHT AND CAN'T AGREE ON A SINGLE THING
NO ONE COULD BLAME FRED REALLY SINCE NO ONE REALLY WANTS TO BE EATEN
FRED SHE WAS TALKING TO HER BEST FRIEND MAGGIE THE MAGPIE ABOUT GOING TO THE MOON YES THE BIG ONE IN THE SKY THAT IS MOST LIKELY NOT MADE OF CHEESE AND MOST CERTAINLY NOT MADE OF BAMBOO
BUT PHYSICAL FITNESS WAS NOT THE ONLY REASON THAT FRED LOVED THE PANDAS THE OTHER REASON WAS THAT ANYONE WHO GETS WITHIN THREE FEET OF A PANDA AUTOMATICALLY FALLS IN LOVE WITH THEM
THE PANDA
HMM HEAVIER THAN I THOUGHT I THINK WE WILL NEED MORE MAGPIES SAID MAGGIE YES BUT HOW MANY MORE YIN YIN SAID I'M NOT SURE EXACTLY REPLIED MAGGIE
IT'S NOT THAT YOU AREN'T SELLING ENOUGH STUFFED PANDA BEARS IT'S JUST THAT THERE HAVEN'T BEEN ENOUGH PEOPLE COMING TO SEE YOU IN THE FIRST PLACE I THINK WHAT ZOOS NEEDS IS A GREAT ADVERTISING CAMPAIGN
OH WELL THAT MAKES SENSE THEN SAID THE MANAGER DID YOU KNOW THAT SINCE THE LITTLE PANDA BUILT THAT BAMBOO ROCKET SHIP AND THOSE MAGPIE'S STARTED FLUTTERING ABOUT THAT THE ZOO'S PROFITS HAVE GONE UP FOUR GONE UP FOUR THOUSAND PERCENT THIS IS JUST THE TYPE OF EXPOSURE WE NEEDED THOSE PANDAS WILL BE WITH US FOR A LONG TIME
MANY PEOPLE KNOW THAT PANDAS EAT BAMBOO A LOT OF IT A LOT OF BAMBOO CAN GET CAN GET QUITE HEAVY SO BECAUSE OF THE PANDAS FRED BECAME VERY STRONG AND WAS IN TERRIFIC SHAPE
GOING TO THE MOON INDEED NONSENSE YOUR JOB IS TO BE CUTE SO PEOPLE WANT TO RUN OFF TO THE GIFT SHOP AND TO BUY PANDA BEAR DOLLS
AS FOR YIN YIN SHE WAS VERY PROUD TO BE RENAMED AFTER A FAMOUS EXPLORER AND SHE AND MAGGIE NEVER STOPPED TRYING TO GET TO THE MOON
ONE MORNING FRED WAS FEEDING YIN YIN AND SAID OH YIN YIN I WISH THAT MORE PEOPLE WOULD COME TO VISIT THE ZOO
WHILE WHY HE WAS FEEDING THE PANDAS LIKE HE WAS SUPPOSED TO SO ONE DAY AFTER SO ONE DAY AFTER FRED HAD FED THE PANDAS AND WAS HUGGING THE PALM TREE THE ZOO MANAGER CAME UP TO HIM AND SAID WHAT IS GOING ON WITH YOUR PANDAS WITH YOUR PANDAS FRED I'VE NEVER SEEN ANYTHING LIKE IT
FOR FRED WHEN IT CAME TO THE PANDAS HE HAD A WARM SPOT IN HIS HEART ACTUALLY FEEDING THE PANDAS WAIT UH ACTUALLY IT WAS EIGHTY FIVE POINT DEGREE SPOT ON HIS LEFT KIDNEY BUT THE POINT IS THAT HE WAS VERY FOND OF FEEDING THE PANDAS
HER MOTHER AND FATHER KNEW WHAT THEY WERE TALKING ABOUT SINCE THEY HADN'T THOUGHT OR TALKED MUCH OF OF ELSE SINCE YIN YIN SAID I WANT TO GO THERE AND POINTED TO THE MOON
YIN YIN'S FATHER MOO MAN DIDN'T THINK IT WAS VERY PROPER OR WISE FOR A YOUNG PANDA BEAR TO GO ROLLING OFF TO PLACES WHERE THERE WASN'T ANY BAMBOO BUT SHE WAS SUPPORTIVE OF HIS YOUNG DAUGHTER AND SHOWED HIS SUPPORT BY TAKING A NAP
FRED WAS NOT ALLOWED TO ACTUALLY HUG THE PANDA BEARS SINCE THAT HE COULD BE DANGEROUS SO ALL THE OTHER PEOPLE AT THE ZOO WOULD KNOW THAT THE PANDAS HAD JUST BEEN FED WHEN THEY SAW FRED HUGGING THE RATHER UN CUDDLY PALM TREE OUTSIDE OF THE PANDA'S HOME
IT WAS FRED'S IDEA SO LET'S BEGIN WITH FRED FRED FED THE PANDA BEARS THE TIGERS AND TURTLES THE TURTLES WEREN'T SO BAD BUT AS FOR THE TIGERS HE WASN'T SO SURE
SO MAGGIE FLEW TO THE OWL AND ASKED FOR HIS ADVICE OH WISE OWL I HAVE A QUESTION THAT I FEAR ONLY YOU CAN ANSWER SHE SAID
WHEN WHEN COLUMBUS SET OUT ON HIS SHIP HE WAS REALLY TRYING TO FIND A QUICKER WAY TO GET TO GET TO GET AROUND EUROPE IN ORDER TO IMPROVE TRADE HE WANTED TO BE A BUSINESS MAN BUT INSTEAD BECAME A GREAT EXPLORER
BUT I JUST LEARNED HOW TO MAKE MYSELF INTO A BALL AND ROLL TWO DAYS AGO AND I'VE BECOMING VERY GOOD AT IT I DON'T THINK IT WILL TAKE THAT LONG TO ROLL THERE SAID YIN YIN
IT WAS GROSS THEN SUDDENLY THE FLIES FLEW AWAY FAST AS THEY COULD
THEN TWO LANDED ON EVERYONE
TO CELEBRATE THE THAT FOR ONCE THERE WAS NO
BUT I HAVE TO PLAY I WAS BORN TO DO IT
AND ACCIDENTALLY SMASHED IT INTO PIECES
FOR JOHN'S MOUTH THEN PERHAPS HE COULD PLAY THE FLUTE NORMALLY
SAID POLICE
THE BAD
AND GUESS WHAT IT WORKED
THEY GOT TONS AND TONS OF FLIES
HE WAS THE NEW TOWN DENTIST HE WAS A VERY EXCELLENT
AN ECHO IN THE WELL THAT MADE THE FLUTE SOUND LOUDER

UHM AND EVERYBODY ELSE WOULD HAVE TO WEAR EARPLUGS
THE FLIES HATE JOHN'S FLUTE PLAYING AS MUCH AS WE DO JOHN D

OH NO SAID SAID CHIEF SANDERS JUST WHEN THINGS WERE GO GOING GOOD IN FRANKSVILLE
BUT I HAVE TO PLAY I WAS BORN TO DO IT
FRANKSVILLE WAS A TOWN THAT SEEMED TO HAVE ONE P ONE PROBLEM AFTER THE OTHER
SO THERE WAS A PROBLEM IN THE LITTLE TOWN OF FRANKSVILLE
I'M SERIOUS WHAT STILL IT'S STILL UH STILL IT'S NOT AS BAD AS MILLIONS OF FLIES I SUPPOSE
BUT IT WAS TOO LATE JOHN HAD STARTED PLAYING
EVERYBODY'S TEETH WERE SO MUCH TEETH WERE MUCH WHITER AND CLEANER AND NO ONE HAD ANY CAVITIES
DOCTOR WONG WAS THE TOWN HERO
JOHN THE DENTIST IS DRIVING THE F FLIES AWAY
TH THEN THEY DECIDED TO LOWER HIM DOWN A WELL AND LET HIM PLAY DOWN WHERE NO ONE COULD HEAR HIM
THEN THE FLY LANDED ON SOMEONE ELSE THEN THE THEN SOME LANDED ON A BUNCH OF PEOPLE
I I EVEN WROTE YOU A SONG CHIEF SANDERS IT'S CALLED COPS AND ROBBERS
THEY GOT TONS AND TONS OF FLIES THEY THEN THE FLIES STOPPED
WINDOW WERE BREAKING AND ALL COWS IN TOWN STARTED TO MAKE SOUR MILK
DOCTOR WONG THOUGHT FOR A SECOND THEN P PRONOUNCED
WELL I'M SURE YOU GUESSED THAT DIDN'T WORK
HE PLAYED MANY MUSICS MUSICAL INSTRUMENTS SUCH AS THE GUITAR THE TUBA THE PIANO AND THE CLARINET
THEY WERE UP T THEY WERE UP ON THE MAIN FLOAT
IT WAS GROSS THEN SUDDENLY THE FLIES FLEW AWAY FAST AS THEY COULD
PHEW PHEW SAID PAPA BEAR I'M GLAD THAT'S OVER YES INDEED AGREED MAMA
IT DIDN'T TAKE SISTER LONG TO DECIDE TO PULL OFF THOSE BITS OF TAPE
THERE WAS QUITE A LOT OF WORK SPELLING NUMBER PROBLEMS ALL KINDS OF THINGS
I CAN'T GET OUT OF IT WITHOUT A LITTLE HELP
I'M NOT EXACTLY SURE MAMA SISTER SAID BUT SOME OF THEM ARE GETTING SORE
I MEAN BUT INSTEAD OF A DIME AND INSTEAD OF GIVING TO HER AT THE END OF EACH DAY WHAT AND INTERESTING IDEA SAID MAMA AS SHE LISTENED TO WISE OLD GRIZZLY GRAN
THERE HAD BEEN NURSERY SCHOOL WHICH WAS PURE FUN PLAYING WITH DOLLS AND BLOCKS ROLLING CLAY SNAKES AND SCRIBBLING WITH CRAYONS
I I COULD READ HER THE RIOT ACT TO HER SUGGESTED PAPA YOU KNOW NAIL BITING IS AN OUTRAGEOUS DISGRACEFUL HABIT AND IF YOU DON'T STOP IT IM IMMEDIATELY
S AND SISTER NIBBLED HER NAILS NIBBLE NIBBLE NIBBLE NIBBLE
OPPS OH THERE IT WENT A D A DAY IS A LONG TIME AND HABITS ARE POWERFUL ESPECIALLY BAD HABITS EVEN WITH THE PROMISE OF A DIME SISTER COULDN'T REMEMBER NOT TO NIBBLE PAPA AND MAMA AND PAPA GOT DISCOURAGED TOO
WHEN DEC WHEN SOME NAIL DECIDED IT NEEDED NIBBLED THE PLAN WORKED NOT PERFECTLY IT'S HARD TO BREAK A BAD HABIT AND SISTER HAD TO GIVE BACK SOME OF THOSE PENNIES GIVE BACK SOME OF THOSE PENNIES BUT IN TEN DAYS SHE HAD NINETY THREE PENNIES
BITS OF TAPE HELPED SISTER REMEMBER NOT TO NIBBLE BUT THEY ALSO GOT IN THE WAY WHEN SHE TRIED TO DO CER CERTAIN THINGS IT'S VERY HARD TO HOLD A PENCIL WITH TAPE ALL OVER YOUR FINGERTIPS TUNE THE TV OR SCRATCH WHEN YOU HAVE AN ITCH
UH BREATHING A GREAT SIGH OF RELIEF THAT'S WHEN BROTHER BEAR LOOKED UP LOOKED AT HIS FINGERNAILS AND PIPED
HABITS ARE A VERY IMPORTANT PART OF OUR LIFE AND MOST OF THEM ARE GOOD LIKE BRUSHING YOUR TEETH AND COMBING YOUR FUR WHEN YOU GET YOU GET UP UP IN THE MORNING AND LOOKING BOTH WAYS BEFORE YOU CROSS A ROAD
AS SHE THOUGHT OF ALL THE LOVELY DIMES SHE WAS GOING TO GET BUT THE WAY IT TURNED OUT SHE DIDN'T GET A SINGLE DIME ALL SHE GOT WAS DISCOURAGED ALL DAY LONG
HERE IS THIS IS WHERE I WANT TO PLANT THE BULBS WHAT ABOUT MY NAIL BITING HABIT ASKED SISTER AS SHE REACHED OUT TO HELP GET THE GET OUT OF THE DEEP RUT HOW AM I S HOW AM I GOING TO GET OUT OF IT
HMM SAID MAMA HERE'S WHAT WE'LL DO WE'LL PUT A LITTLE MEDICINE ON THE SORES AND BITS OF ADHESIVE TAPE ON ALL OF THEM THAT WAY THAT WILL REMIND YOU NOT TO NIBBLE AND YOU AND WILL GET THE CHANCE TO GROW THEM BACK
THEY GAVE SISTER TEN PENNIES ONE FOR EACH NAIL AT THE BEGINNING OF EACH DAY
GREAT FOR PICKING THINGS UP TUNING THE TV AND SCRATCHING ITCHES
I SUPPOSE SO SAID PAPA THOUGHTFULLY PERHAPS SOME OF SOME SORT OF REWARD WOULD HELP A BIT OF MONEY LET'S SAY A DIME FOR EVERY DAY SHE DOESN'T BITE HER NAILS
AND IT KEEPS GETTING DEEPER EVERY TIME I USE IT
OH DEAR SAID MAMA BEAR TO SISTER WHEN THE CUBS GOT HOME FROM SCHOOL ONE DAY
WHAT HAVE YOU TRIED SO FAR MMM UH HUH WELL I THINK YOU'RE ON THE RIGHT TRACK WITH THE DIME BUT INSTEAD OF GIVING HER A DIME AT THE INSTEAD OF GIVING GIVE IT TO HER AT THE END OF EACH DAY
BUT EVEN BIGGER SHE HAD FIVE FINGER HE HAD SHE HAD TEN FINE FINGERNAILS
THE BERENSTAIN BEARS AND THE BAD HABIT
THAT'S WHAT HAPPENED TO SOME CUBS IN TEACHER JANE'S CLASS
A HABIT MAMA SAID AS SHE PUSHED THE WHEELBARROW ALONG THE WELL WORN PATH IS SOMETHING YOU DO SO OFTEN YOU DON'T EVEN HAVE TO THINK ABOUT IT
THAT'S RIGHT SAID PAPA UNTIL THE HABIT'S BROKEN I'LL NEVER NIBBLE AGAIN SHE SAID
IN REGULAR SCHOOL YOU'D HAVE TO CONCENTRATE AND SOMETIMES WHEN YOU CONCENTRATE YOU FORM LITTLE NERVOUS HABITS
THAT'S WHY IT IS IT IS WITH A BAD HABIT THE MORE OF YOU GET USE IT THE HARDER IT GET IT IS TO GET OUT OF IT
SO THEY TRIED GRAN'S IDEA INSTEAD OF A DIME AT THE END OF EACH DAY
BUT WORST OF ALL THE BITS OF TAPE TOLD THE WHOLE WORLD THAT SISTER BEAR WAS A NAIL BITER

YOU'VE NIBBLED YOUR DALS NAILS DOWN TO NUBBINS IN FACT YOU'VE NIBBLED THEM CLEAN OFF HOW DID HOW DID IT HAPPEN
AND HE WAS SORT OF
MAYBE A POORLY PLAYED FLUTE DOESN'T SOUND ALL THAT BAD
THE FLUTE SOUNDED NORMAL AND IT TURNED OUT JOHN COULD PLAY IT QUITE WELL
BUT THEY COULDN'T KEEP JOHN IN JAIL SINCE HE WASN'T REALLY BREAKING ANY LAWS SO THERE WAS NOTHING THE POLICE COULD DO
DOCTOR WONG THOUGHT FOR A SECOND THEN PRONOUNCED IT'S THE FLUTE SOUND THE FLIES HATE JOHN'S FLUTE PLAYING AS MUCH AS WE DO
OH NO SAID CHIEF SANDERS JUST WHEN THINGS WERE G GOING GOOD FOR FRANKSVILLE
PEOPLE WERE GETTING INTO CAR ACCIDENTS AND EVERYONE EVERYBODY LOOKED REALLY SILLY AT DANCES DANCING TO MUSIC THEY COULDN'T HEAR
THEIR PROBLEMS STARTED WHEN THEY RAN OUT OF WATER
THE LOCAL SCIENTIST DOCTOR WONG CAME UP WITH AN IDEA
OH THAT'S A NICE INSTRUMENT BUT IT'S JUST NOT THE FLUTE
HE WAS THE NEW HE WAS THE NEW TOWN DENTIST
DOCTOR WONG AND JOHN WERE THE STARS OF THE PARADE
WITH THE BAD BECAUSE AS BAD AS THE FLUTE SOUNDED IT WAS A LOT BETTER THAN THOUSANDS OF FLIES CRAWLING ON THEM
HE WAS VERY UPSET AT FIRST THEN HE SAID OH WELL GOOD THING I BROUGHT MY OLD FLUTE AS BACK UP
WINDOWS WERE BREAKING AND ALL THE COWS IN TOWN STARTED TO MAKE SOUR MILK
BEFORE I TELL YOU HOW ROOSTER JOHN GOT HIS NAME YOU SHOULD KNOW A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE TOWN OF FRANKSVILLE
BUT I HAVE TO BUT I HAVE TO PLAY I WAS BORN TO DO IT I DON'T KNOW WHY BUT I FEEL LIKE I HAVE TO OR ELSE BAD THINGS WILL HAPPEN
THE BAD FLUTE PLAYER WAS ROOSTER JOHN
SINCE HE HAD BECOME THE TOWN DENTIST EVERYBODY'S TEETH WERE MUCH WHITER AND CLEANER AND NO ONE HAD ANY CAVITIES
IT WAS THEN THAT THE PEOPLE OF FRANKSVILLE REALIZED THAT THEY WOULD HAVE TO TAKE THE GOOD
THE NEIGHBOR THE NEIGHBORS ARE COMPLAINING AND THE CATS AND DOGS ARE TRYING TO CHEW OFF THEIR EARS
THE FLIES WERE ANNOYED SO H HE WOULD SWAT THEM SWAT AT THEM WITH HIS HAND OR EVEN HIS NEW FLUTE
THEY DECIDED TO LOWER HIM DOWN A WELL AND LET HIM PLAY DOWN THERE WHERE NO ONE COULD HEAR HIM
THEY GOT TONS AND TONS OF FLIES THEN THE FLIES STOPPED
AND GUESS WHAT IT WORKED
THE FLIES WOULD LAND ALL OVER THE PEOPLE AND THEY COULDN'T SWAT THEM OFF
HE PLAYED MANY MUSICAL INSTRUMENTS SUCH AS THE GUITAR THE TUBA THE PIANO AND THE CLARINET
THEN PRETTY SOON TONS OF FLIES WERE LANDING ON EVERYONE
WELL I'M SURE YOU GUESSED THAT DIDN'T WORK
DONE
WHEN THE TOWNSFOLK HEARD THE NOISE THEY COULDN'T EVEN SWAT AT THE FLIES ANYMORE THEY HAD TO COVER THEIR EARS FROM THE HORRIBLE SOUND
ROOSTER JOHN
THAT'S HOW THE FLUTE SOUNDED WHEN THIS GUY PLAYED IT I'M SERIOUS STILL IT'S NOT AS BAD AS MILLIONS OF FLIES I SUPPOSE
THE PEOPLE IN
BUT JUST TRY TO IMAGINE SOMEONE SCRATCHING A CHALKBOARD WITH A FORK AND THEN MULTIPLYING THAT TIMES A HUNDRED
JOHN THE DENTIST IS DRIVING THE FLIES AWAY
BESIDES EVERYONE LOVED JOHN
JOHN DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TO DO SO HE JUST KEPT ON PLAYING HIS FLUTE
WE CAN'T LET YOU PLAY THE FLUTE ANYMORE JOHN POLICE CHIEF SANDERS SAID
THEY JUST COULDN'T LEAD A NORMAL LIFE
HE THOUGHT THAT IF HE MADE A NEW MOUTHPIECE ESPECIALLY SHAPED FOR JOHN'S MOUTH THEN PERHAPS HE COULD PLAY THE FLUTE NORMALLY
THANKFULLY SOMEONE WAS DIGGING A HOLE AND FOUND WATER BUT SOON AFTER THAT THEY STARTED TO GET FLIES
I EVEN WROTE YOU A SONG CHIEF SANDERS I CALLED IT COPS AND ROBBERS
THEN SUDDENLY A FLY LANDED ON A LITTLE GIRL THEN A FLY LANDED ON SOMEONE ELSE AND THEN SOME LANDED SOME LANDED ON A BUNCH OF PEOPLE
HE WAS AN EXCELLENT DENTIST BUT HIS REAL LOVE WAS MUSIC
SO THEY DECIDED THAT JOHN COULD PLAY THE FLUTE AND EVERYBODY ELSE WOULD HAVE TO WEAR EARPLUGS
THEY WERE UP ON THE MAIN FLOAT A BIG BAND PLAYED AS THEY MARCHED UP THE TOWN MAIN STREET EVERYONE CHEERED
FROM THEN ON JOHN WOULD WAKE UP AT SUNRISE LIKE A ROOSTER AND AND PLAY TO KEEP THE FLIES AWAY
NO NO PLEASE DON'T PLAY YOUR OLD FLUTE BEGGED DOCTOR WONG BUT IT WAS TOO LATE JOHN HAD STARTED PLAYING
FRANKSVILLE WAS A TOWN THAT SEEMED TO HAVE ONE PROBLEM AFTER AFTER THE OTHER
LOOK JOHN I'VE HEARD YOU PLAY THE CLARINET YOU'RE QUITE GOOD WHY DON'T YOU PLAY THAT INSTEAD SAID CHIEF SANDERS
HE WASN'T CALLED ROOSTER JOHN YET THAT CAME LATER
WHAT WOULD THEY DO THEY COULDN'T KEEP JOHN IN JAIL THEY DIDN'T WANT TO KICK HIM OUT OF TOWN BECAUSE THEY HAD SUCH NICE TEETH
THE TOWN DECIDED TO HAVE A GREAT BIG PARADE IN FRANKSVILLE TO CELEBRATE THE FACT THAT FOR ONCE THERE WAS NO WATER PROBLEM NO FLY PROBLEM PROBLEM AND NO FLUTE PROBLEM
SO SO THERE WAS A PROBLEM IN THE LITTLE TOWN OF FRANKSVILLE
HE STARTED SHAKING THE FLUTE TO GET THE FLIES OFF AND ACCIDENTALLY SMASHED IT INTO PIECES
JOHN THOUGHT THAT WAS AN OK IDEA BUT THERE WAS AN ECHO IN THE WELL THAT MADE THE FLUTE SOUND LOUDER
DOCTOR WONG WAS THE TOWN HERO
BUT JUST THEN A MAN MOVED INTO TOWN WHO PLAYED THE FLUTE SO BADLY THAT PEOPLE WOULD RUN AWAY SCREAMING
IT WAS GROSS THEN SUDDENLY THE FLIES FLEW AWAY FAST AS THEY COULD
THEN HE PLAYED THE SONG THE POLICE CHIEF HATED THE SOUND SO MUCH THAT HE THREW JOHN IN JAIL
BEFORE THEY KNEW IT THE TOWN WAS FILLED WITH FLIES AGAIN
HOWEVER FOR SOME REASON THE WAY HIS MOUTH WAS SHAPED MADE HIS FLUTE SOUND AWFUL
NO ONE COULD HEAR ANYTHING
THE AIRPLANE RIDE
IF I WANTED TO BE A PILOT
THEN JENNIFER CAME UP TO ME AND SAID SHE HAD A SURPRISE I THOUGHT GREAT MORE PEANUTS BUT IT WASN'T PEANUTS IT WAS SOMETHING REALLY COOL
THE PILOT TOLD ME THAT IT WASN'T REALLY THE HARD ONE HARD ONCE YOU PRACTICE
THAT'S WHEN I MISSED MY PARENTS THE MOST BUT ONCE THE PLANE WAS IN THE AIR I WAS PRETTY GOOD
I HAD SEVEN COLAS AND FOUR GINGER ALES WHICH MADE ME HAVE TO GO TO THE BATHROOM EIGHT TIMES
BUT I BUT GUESS WHAT I WAS TOO SHORT TO REACH THE BUTTON SO I STARED STARTED YELLING HEY PEANUT LADY HEY PEANUT LADY
AND IF SHE WOULD GET ME A BANANA SPLIT I WOULD I WOULDN'T HAVE TO GO THE BATHROOM AS MUCH SO MUCH
AT FIRST I THOUGHT WOW LOOK AT ALL THOSE BUTTONS THEN I THOUGHT THERE'S NO WAY THAT ANYONE CAN REMEMBER TO PUSH ALL THOSE BUTTONS AT THE RIGHT TIME ARE WE GOING TO CRASH
I'VE ALWAYS THOUGHT FLYING WAS FUN YOU GO HIGHER THAN ANY MOUNTAIN AND YOU GO FASTER THAN ANY CAR
I SAID SOMEDAY I'M GOING TO BE A PILOT I'LL ONLY SERVE BANANA SPLITS ON MY PLANE
A MILLION BUTTONS AND LEVERS AND KNOBS AND STUFF
I TOLD HER THAT I WANTED A BANANA SPLIT INSTEAD BUT SHE SAID THEY DON'T HAVE ANY BANANA SPLITS ON THE PLANE
I DIDN'T KNOW ANYONE AT ALL AND I HAD TO GO ALL THE WAY FROM NEW YORK TO TEXAS WITHOUT MY PARENTS
BUT IT WAS HER FAULT SHE WAS THE ONE THAT KEPT TRYING TO GIVE ME PEANUTS
FINALLY WE LANDED THAT'S ALWAYS SCARY IT SEEMS LIKE THE PLANE IS GOING TOO FAST TO EVER STOP BUT IT DOES
JENNIFER TOOK ME TO THE COCKPIT AND THERE WERE
HE SAID HE THOUGHT I WOULD MAKE A REALLY GREAT PILOT SOMEDAY IF I WANTED TO BE
I TRIED TO WATCH THE MOVIE BUT I HAD ALREADY SEEN THAT ONE SO IT WAS BORING
IT AND TOOK ME STRAIGHT TO THE ICE CREAM SHOP
THE WAY I FIGURED IT MY GAME BOY OR THE WAY I FIGURED IT MY GAME BOY ONLY HAS FIVE BUTTONS AND I CAN GET PAST LEVEL THREE
I GUESS IT WAS BECAUSE THE PLANE WAS SO LOUD AND I DIDN'T KNOW ANYBODY OR ANYONE
I ONLY USED THE GREEN CRAYON BECAUSE IT WAS THE TALLEST AND I WANTED IT TO CATCH UP TO THE RED BROWN BLUE YELLOW PURPLE AND BLACK ONES
THE FIRST TIME I EVER TOOK AN AIRPLANE BY MYSELF IT WAS FUN AND SCARY
HE WAS REALLY NICE BUT HE WOULDN'T PLAY GO FISH WITH ME
EVENTUALLY THE FLIGHT ATTENDANT SEEMED TO GET A LITTLE ANNOYED THAT I HAD TO GO THE BATHROOM SO MUCH
SHE SAID THE CAPTAIN WAS INVITING ME TO SEE THE COCKPIT I THOUGHT AWESOME I ALSO BROUGHT MY DECK OF CARDS IN CASE THE PILOT WAS BORED AND WANTED TO PLAY GO FISH
SHE SAID THAT SHE HAD TO HELP OTHER PASSENGERS
MY MOM GAVE ME A COLORING BOOK OF COOL LOOKING DRAGONS TO KEEP ME BUSY I COLORED THE DRAGON PICTURES ALL GREEN SO IT DIDN'T TAKE VERY LONG
AND HE TOLD ME THAT HE W HE ONCE PLAYED A GAME I HAD ON MY GAME BOY
HE LAUGHED EVEN THOUGH I WASN'T JOKING
I WAS GLAD THAT THERE WASN'T ANY ANYONE NEXT TO ME THE PERSON THAT SAT NEXT TO ME
SHE DIDN'T LIKE BEING CALLED PEANUT LADY BUT SHE DID GET ME THE GAME OR GET ME MY GAME BOY
SHE TOLD ME TO BE QUIET AND WATCH THE MOVIE
BUT I TELL YOU THE TRUTH WITHOUT MY PARENTS THERE I WAS PRETTY NERVOUS
GRANDPA LAUGHED AND I TO AND I TOOK
IF YOU CAN'T EVEN GET PAST LEVEL ONE AND YOU'RE A PILOT THEN I COULD BE A PILOT S TOO SINCE I'M MUCH BETTER AT PUSHING BUTTONS THAN YOU
ONE THING ABOUT BEING BY YOURSELF ON YOUR ON AN AIRPLANE IS THAT THE FLIGHT ATTENDANTS ARE VERY NICE TO YOU
I TRIED TO PUSH THE BUTTON THAT LIGHTS UP THE OVER HEAD SO THE FLIGHT ATTENDANT COULD WOULD COME
BUT SOMETIMES PEOPLE LIKE TO EAT PEANUTS ON THEIR BANANA SPLITS I TOLD HER THAT I WAS THAT THE PEANUTS THAT WERE MAKING ME SO THIRSTY IN THE FIRST PLACE
I WAS FLYING THERE TO SEE MY GRANDFATHER AND WE WERE GOING TO GO FISHING
WHEN I GOT OFF THE AIRPLANE THERE WAS GRANDPA WAITING FOR ME HE SAID HOW WA HOW WAS YOUR FLIGHT
I HAD A GAME BOY IN MY BACKPACK MY BACKPACK WAS O IN THE OVERHEAD THINGY
AND HE COULDN'T EVEN PASS LEVEL ONE I SAID
WOULD HAVE BEEN VERY ANNOYED
SHE TOLD ME TO CALL HER JENNIFER INSTEAD I PLAYED ON MY GAME BOY UNTIL I GOT A NEW HIGH S MY NEW HIGH SCORE
IT WAS WORTH THE THE WHOLE TRIP TO JUST EAT A BANANA SPLIT WITH GRANDPA
THE FLIGHT ATTENDANT GAVE ME A DECK OF CARDS BUT SHE WOULDN'T PLAY GO FISH WITH ME
I STARTED THINKING WE MIGHT CRASH I DIDN'T LIKE TO THINK ABOUT THAT BUT I COULDN'T HELP IT
IMAGINE HOW HARD IT WOULD BE TO WORK ALL THOSE MILLIONS OF BUTTONS AND EAT PEANUTS
THIS MEANS THAT WE HAVE A NEW CHAMPION THE REAL WINNER IS SWISH SOFTBELLY FROM BLUE POND THE CROWD WENT WILD
THAT'S NOT A ROCK SWEETIE SAID HIS MOM THAT'S MUD SWISH MADE A LOUD GULP SOUND JUST DO YOUR BEST HIS MOM SAID
WE ALL WANT YOU TO LOOK GOOD WHEN YOU BRING HOME THE CUP MRS SNAPPER WOULD SAY HI SWISHY DO YOU WANT SOME YUMMY PIE TO FILL YOU UP AND SLOW YOU DOWN FOR THE BIG RACE A FAT TURTLE IS A SLOW TURTLE
IT LOOKED AS IF NEITHER OF THEM HAD MOVED AT ALL THEY WERE BOTH MOVING OF COURSE BUT THEY WERE SO SLOW THAT IT WAS HARD TO TELL AFTER SIX HOURS MUD AND SWISH WERE STILL TIED TIED AND HAD ONLY MOVED A FEW INCHES
THIS WAS THE MOST FAMOUS TURTLE THERE WAS
MRS TORT WENT UP TO SWISH AND GAVE HIM THE TURTLE CUP SHE SAID SWISH YOU ARE THE YOUNGEST WINNER OF THE GREAT TURTLE RACE THIS WAS THE MOST EXCITING FINISH WE'VE EVER HAD I THINK THAT YOU'LL BE A GREAT CHAMPION FOR MANY YEARS SINCE TURTLES ARE ONLY ONLY GET SLOWER WITH AGE
SINCE TURTLES NEVER CHEAT THIS IS THE MOST IMPORTANT RULE TO BREAK THIS RULE WOULD MEAN AN END TO THE GREAT TURTLE RACE FOREVER
WE NEVER THOUGHT OF WE NEVER THOUGHT OF THAT THEY ALL SAID THE TOWN AGREED TO S TO TREAT SWISH LIKE A NORMAL TURTLE AND AFTER A WHILE SWISH DECIDED THAT HE WOULD BE P PROUD TO RACE FOR HIS VILLAGE
HE PUT THE EARPLUGS IN HIS EARS AND COULDN'T HEAR MUD SINGING ANYMORE
LOOK THERE'S YOUR COUSIN PEEK A BOO FROM BIG PUDDLE VILLAGE SAID SWISH'S MOTHER YOU'LL GET TO MEET ALL SORTS OF NEW TURTLES
THIS TURTLE IS NAMED SWISH WHEN SWISH WAS BORN EVERY EVERYONE THOUGHT HE WAS A LITTLE SLOW BUT AS HE GOT OLDER THE A LITTLE OLDER THE TURTLES BEGAN TO REALIZE THAT SWISH WAS REALLY REALLY REALLY SLOW
EVERYTHING ABOUT THE FESTIVAL WAS FUN BUT THE MAIN EVENT WAS THE GREAT TURTLE RACE
AFTER SEVEN DAYS OF PLAYING AND DANCING A BUG EATING FINALLY THE DAY OF THE RACE CAME THE MAYOR OF GREAT POND MRS TORT P POSTED THE RULES OF THE RACE ON A TREE FROM FOR EVERYONE TO SEE
I NEVER PROMISED THAT I WOULD WIN THE RACE I CAN'T BEAT MUD ANYWAY I HEARD ONCE IT T IT TOOK HIM THREE DAYS JUST TO YAWN
MUD DIDN'T ANSWER THE MAYOR TAPPED MUD ON THE SHELL AND SAID HELLO HELLO MUD
MUD SAID TO MUD SAID TO SWISH THERE'S NO WAY THAT A TURTLE AS YOUNG AS YOU CAN BE SO SLOW EVEN IF WAS FASTER THAN YOU WHEN I WAS YOUR AGE YOU'RE CHEATING YOU'RE GOING TO RUIN THE GREAT RACE FOREVER
IT WAS BECAUSE OF SWISH THAT BLUE POND BECAME THE MOST RESPECTED POND IN THE LAND
THERE WERE ABOUT THREE HUNDRED TURTLE RACING THREE HUNDRED TURTLES RACING
S SWISH WAS SAD THAT HE LOST BUT ALL THE TURTLES FROM BLUE POND CHEERED FOR SWISH
WHEN ALL TURTLES ARRIVED THERE IT WAS A SEVEN DAY FESTIVAL CALLED THE SH SH SHELL DWELLERS FESTIVAL WHERE THERE WAS LOTS OF EATING AND LAUGHING
ALL THE EXTRA ATTENTION MADE SWISH VERY UNCOMFORTABLE
MISTER PEEKS WOULD NEVER DO ANYTHING FOR F FOR FREE BUT HE WAS GOING TO GIVE SWISH A FREE SHELL WAXING THIS WAS THE KIND OF THING THAT SWISH WOULD GET ALL THE TIME
MUD KNEW THAT THIS WOULD BE HIS CLOSEST RACE EVER AND HE WAS ACTUALLY GETTING A LITTLE BIT SCARED
SWISH TOOK UP THE C TOOK THE CUP THAT DAY FOR THE FIRST TIME
SWISH READ THE RULES EV EVEN THOUGHT HE KNEW THEM BY HEART THEN HE HEARD THE MAYOR SAY RUNNER'S PLEASE TAKE YOUR POSITIONS
SWISH HAD TO BE CAR CARRIED ON HIS FATHER'S BACK SINCE IT WOULD HAVE TAKEN HIM MONTHS TO GET TO THE GREAT POND BY HIMSELF FINALLY AFTER THE LONG JOURNEY ALL THE TURTLES ARRIVED AT GREAT POND
THE CROWD THOUGHT HE MUST HAVE REALIZED THAT HIS SINGING TRICK WASN'T WORKING BUT THEY ALL BUT THEN RIGHT AT THE END RIGHT BEFORE THE SUNSET SWISH STARTED TO PULL AHEAD OF MUD
SWISH'S MOM SMILED AND SAID I KNOW THAT YOU CAN WIN SWISH BUT IT'S AN HONOR JUST TO GET TO THE RACE SAID SWISH'S MOM
THE BLUE P BLUE POND WAS A NICE VILLAGE LOCATED ABOUT THREE DAY CRAWLS FROM THE GREAT POND THEY ALL FELT A LI LITTLE SAD BECAUSE THEY HADN'T HELD THE TURTLE CUP IN OVER A SEVEN HUND IN OVER SEVEN HUNDRED YEARS YEARS SO WITH SWISH THEY THOUGHT MAYBE JUST MAYBE HE COULD BRING BACK THE TURTLE CUP TO THEIR LITTLE POND
THE TURTLE CUP WAS THE TROPHY THAT THE WINNER WOULD TAKE HOME TO THEIR VILLAGE IT HAD BEEN A SLUDGE P FOR POND FOR EVERY FIFTY YEARS BECAUSE NO ONE COULD EVER BEAT THEIR TURTLE
RULE NUMBER TWO ALL TURTLES MUST RUN AS FAST AS THEY CAN ALL AND THE TURTLE THAT IS CLOSEST TO THE STARTING LINE WINS
ALL THE TURTLES IN BLUE POND HELD A MEETING TO DISCUSS THE PROBLEM THE MAYOR DOCTOR SOFTSHELL SAID THIS IS RIDICULOUS SWISH HAS TO RACE HE'S THE SLOWEST TURTLE I'VE EVERY SEEN EXCEPT FOR MUD OF COURSE WITHOUT HIM WE DON'T HAVE A CHANCE
HE WAS TIRED FROM RACING AND THOUGHT THAT IT WOULD BE NICE TO JUST LISTEN TO MUD'S SWEET VOICE AND FALL ASLEEP
MUD STILL DIDN'T ANSWER IN FACT MUD WAS SOUND ASLEEP
THEN MUD TRIED ANOTHER TRICK HE STARTED SINGING A SOFT BEAUTIFUL LULLABY WHICH STARTED SWISH STARTED YAWNING
BUT THROUGH BUT THOUGH HE CAME TO THE GREATEST AND BIGGEST TURTLE OF ALL TIME MUCH GREATER OR BIGGER THAN MUD HE ALWAYS MADE SURE THAT NO ONE TREATED HIM SPECIAL AND THAT HE TREATED LI EVERYBODY LIKE HE WANTED TO BE TREATED LIKE A TURTLE WITH HONOR
THE MAYOR OF PONDLAND WENT TO THE PRESIDENT OF THE TURTLE CUP TO SLUDGE POND AGAIN
THERE WAS HE WAS THE SLOWEST TURTLE OF ALL TIME HE HADN'T HAD TO MOVE FOR FIFTY YEARS HE WAS THE BIGGEST THE MOST RESPECTED AND ALSO ONE OF THE TRICKIEST TURTLES THERE WAS THERE WERE MANY LEGENDS ABOUT HIM
THE SLOWEST TURTLE EVERY FOUR YEARS TURTLES FROM ALL OVER THE LAND WOULD CRAWL TO THE GREAT POND IT WOULD MAKE SOME TURTLES FROM FAR A AWAY VILLAGES TWO WHOLE WEEKS JUST TO GET THERE
SWISHES FATHER SAID SON I HAVE SOMETHING TO TELL YOU AS YOU KNOW YOUR GREAT GREAT GRAND TURTLE RACED MUD ONCE HE WASN'T AS SLOW AS YOU BUT HE DID TEACH ME L ABOUT MUD'S DIRTY TRICKS
AND THAT WOULD
BUT NOW ALL THE TURTLES WERE USUALLY WAY AHEAD OF MUD BUT THIS TIME SWISH SWISH WAS JUST AS SLOW
MRS SNAPPER WAS VERY NICE TO ANYONE SHE WAS BEING NICE TO SWISH
RULE NUMBER FOUR NO TURTLE MAY FALL ASLEEP SINCE SINCE IF YOU ARE ASLEEP YOU AREN'T RUNNING AS FAST AS YOU CAN
FOR THE FIRST TIME IN SIX HUNDRED YEARS I WOULD LIKE TO PRESENT THE TURTLE CUP TO BLUE POND THE CROWD WENT WILD AGAIN
WHEN THE TIME OF THE FESTIVAL DREW NEAR ALL THE TURTLES IN THE LAND STARTED TOWARD THE GREAT STARTED TOWARD GREAT POND
I WISH A SUDDEN SWISH WAS SUDDENLY VERY EXCITED HE TOLD HIS MOM YOU KNOW WHAT I'M GOING TO WIN YOU KNOW I'M GOING TO WIN THIS RACE I KNOW IT AND ALL THESE TURTLES WILL KNOW THAT BLUE POND RULES I'M NOT AFRAID OF STUPID MUD
ONCE HIS MOTHER CALLED HIM FOR DINNER AND HE DIDN'T MAKE IT HOME UNTIL BREAKFAST THE NEXT MORNING AND HE WAS ONLY A FOOT AWAY
THEY READ RULE NUMBER ONE THE GREAT RACE BEGINS AT SUNRISE AND ENDS AT SUNSET
THE WIN THE WINNER OF THE GREAT TURTLE RACE WAS SO IMPORTANT THAT HE OR SHE DIDN'T HAVE MUCH TO MOVE FOR FOUR YEARS UNTIL THE NEXT FESTIVAL THE LESS A TURTLE MOVES IS THE BIGGER THEY GET AND THE LONGER THEY LIVE SO YOU CAN SEE WINNING THE GREAT THE GREAT RACE IS AN HONOR
SO ONE DAY HE TOLD HIS PARENTS I DON'T WANT TO RACE
BUT SWISH WOULDN'T LET MUD SCARE HIM YOU'RE JUST TRYING TO MAKE ME QUIT AND I'M NOT GOING TO FALL FOR YOUR TRICKS HE SAID TURTLES NEVER CHEAT AND I'M A TURTLE WITH HONOR
HE WOULD NEVER LOSE THE TURTLE CUP FOR THE REST OF HIS LONG LIFE
BUT THEY WERE VERY PROUD HE GAVE MUD SUCH A CLOSE RACE SWISH WAS HAPPY TOO BUT DEEP DOWN INSIDE HE KNEW HE WAS JUST AS SLOW AS MUD
THIS WAS SWISH'S FIRST EVER SHELL DWELLERS FESTIVAL AND HE THOUGHT IT WAS THE MOST WONDERFUL THING HE HAD EVER SEEN THERE WERE THOUSANDS OF TURTLES ALL DIFFERENT SPECIES ALL HAVING GREAT TIME ALL HAVING A GREAT TIME
WHEN MUD WAS IN HIS PRIME THERE WAS A NEW TURTLE BORN IN THE BLUE POND
HE THOUGHT SURE THEY ARE NICE TO ME BECAUSE THEY THINK I CAN WIN THE RACE BUT IF I LOSE THEY'LL BE DISAPPOINTED AND MAD AT ME
THEN HE WHISPERED IN SWISH'S EAR ALL THE TRICKS THAT HIS GREAT GREAT GRAND TURTLE TAUGHT HIM
WHAT WOULD YOU LIKE TO SAY TO ALL THE TURTLES AT THE FESTIVAL THE CROWD STARTED YELLING SPEECH SPEECH
WHO IS THIS YOUNG PUNK HE THOUGHT TO HIMSELF
THE SLOWEST TURTLES FROM EACH POND WERE CARRIED TO THE STARTING LINE BY MEMBERS OF THEIR VILLAGE
HE WOULD TAKE IT MANY MORE TIMES AFTER THAT
OH NO SHOUTED THE FANS MUD'S WINNING IT LOOKS LIKE MUD IS STILL GETTING IS STILL THE GREATEST TURTLE OF THEM ALL AND WHEN THE SUN WENT DOWN MUD WAS THE CLOSEST TURTLE TO THE STARTING LINE THE STARTING LINE
S SWISH SAW A ROCK IN THE MIDDLE OF THE FIELD AND WONDERED HOW COME THEY DON'T MOVE ALL MOVE THAT BIG ROCK OUT OF THE FIELD IT SEEMS TO BE IN EVERYONE'S WAY SWISH SAID
THIS TIME IT WAS A BIT CLOSER THAN YOU WOULD HAVE LIKED I BET
AFTER A FEW MORE HOURS MOST OF THE TURTLES HAD GONE A FEW FEET ALL EXCEPT TWO SWISH AND MUD WERE BOTH BACK AT THE STARTING LINE
RULE NUMBER THREE NO TURTLE MAY PRETEND TO BE GOING FAST BUT GO SLOW INSTEAD ALL TURTLES MUST GO AS FAST AS THEY CAN AT ALL TIMES
THEN HE SNAPPED OUT OF IT AND REMEMBERED HIS FATHER HAD WARNED HIM OF THIS TRICK HE REACHED IN HIS SHELL AND PULLED OUT A COUPLE OF EARPLUGS
MUD HAD ACTUALLY SUNG HIMSELF TO SLEEP LADIES AND GENTLEMEN SHE SAID MUD FROM SLUDGE POND HAS BEEN DISQUALIFIED FOR SLEEPING DURING THE RACE
HE ANNOUNCED WELL WELL MUD IT LOOKS LIKE YOU'VE DONE IT SLUDGE POND WINS THE TURTLE CUP AGAIN
WINDOWS WERE BREAKING AND ALL THE COWS IN TOWN STARTED TO MAKE SOUR MILK
THE PEOPLE IN THE TOWN DECIDED TO HAVE A GREAT BIG PARADE IN FRANKSVILLE TO CELEBRATE THE FACT THAT
NO NO PLEASE DON'T PLAY YOUR OLD FLUTE BEGGED DOCTOR WRONG
AND

SO THERE IS A PROBLEM
JOHN DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TO DO SO HE KEPT PLAYING HIS FLUTE
THAT CAME LATER
WITH HIS NEW FLUTE
HE PLAYED MANY MUSICAL INSTRUMENTS SUCH AS THE GUITAR TUBA AND THE PIANO AND THE CLARINET
BECAUSE AS BAD AS THE FLUTE SOUNDED IT WAS A LOT BETTER THAN THE THOUSANDS OF FLIES CRAWLING ON THEM
IT WAS GROSS THEN SUDDENLY THE FLIES FLEW AWAY FAST AS THEY COULD
ELSE SOMETHING BAD WILL HAPPEN
YOU SHOULD KNOW A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE TOWN OF FRANKSVILLE
I'M SERIOUS

THE NEIGHBORS ARE COMPLAINING AND THE CATS AND DOGS ARE TRYING TO CHEW OFF THEIR EARS
DANCING TO MUSIC THAT THEY COULDN'T REALLY HEAR
SO SHOULD I START HERE
BUT JUST TRY TO IMAGINE SOMEONE SCRATCHING A CHALKBOARD
DOCTOR WRONG AND JOHN WERE THE STARS OF THE PARADE
THE POLICE HATED THE SOUND SO MUCH THAT HE THREW JOHN IN JAIL
ESPECIALLY SHAPED FOR JOHN'S MOUTH THEN PERHAPS HE COULD PLAY THE FLUTE NORMALLY
THEY COULDN'T KEEP JOHN IN JAIL
HE WAS AN EXC EXCELLENT DENTIST
AND ACCIDENTALLY SMASHED IT INTO PIECES HE WAS VERY UPSET AT FIRST THEN HE SAID OH WELL GOOD THING I BROUGHT MY OLD FLUTE AS A BACK UP
THE WAY HIS MOUTH WAS SHAPED MADE THE FLUTE SOUND SO BAD THAT
WASN'T REALLY BREAKING ANY
WHY DID THEY
IT'S THE FLUTE SONG THE FLIES HATE
WHY DON'T YOU PLAY THAT INSTEAD THE POLICE SAID THE POLICE SANDERS
THEIR PROBLEMS STARTED WHEN THEY RAN OUT OF WATER

THEY GOT TONS AND TONS OF FLIES
JOHN WAS THE DENTIST JOHN THE DENTIST IS DRIVING AWAY THE FLIES
COPS AND ROBBERS THEN HE PLAYED THE SONG FOR POLICE SANDERS
THE FLIES WERE SO ANNOYING SO HE WOULD SWAT AT THEM WITH HIS HAND
HE WAS THE NEW TOWN DENTIST
IN THE LITTLE TOWN OF FRANKSVILLE WHAT SHOULD THEY DO
HE STARTED SHAKING THE FLUTE TO GET THE FLIES OFF
BUT FOR SOME REASON
WHY DON'T YOU
FROM THEN ON JOHN WOULD WAKE UP AT SUNRISE LIKE A ROOSTER AND PLAY TO KEEP THE FLIES AWAY
FRANKSVILLE WAS A TOWN THAT SEEMED TO HAVE ONE PROBLEM AFTER THE OTHER
LOOK JOHN I'VE HEARD YOU PLAY THE CLARINET YOU'RE QUITE GOOD
BEFORE THEY KNEW IT THE TOWN WAS FILLED WITH FLIES AGAIN
STILL IT'S NOT AS BAD AS A MILLION FLIES I SUPPOSE
THEN THEY DECIDED TO LOWER HIM DOWN IN A WELL AND LET HIM PLAY WHERE NO ONE COULD HEAR HIM
SO THERE IS NOTHING THAT THE POLICE COULD DO
THE
SO THEY DECIDED THAT JOHN COULD PLAY THE FLUTE AND EVERYBODY ELSE WOULD HAVE TO WEAR EARPLUGS
BUT HIS REAL LOVE WAS MUSIC
BUT JUST THEN A MAN MOVED TO TOWN PLAYING A FLUTE SO BADLY THAT THE PEOPLE WOULD RUN AWAY SCREAMING
HOW ROOSTER JOHN GOT HIS NAME
THE FLIES WOULD LAND ALL OVER THE PEOPLE AND THEY COULDN'T SWAT THEM OFF
THAT'S HOW THE FLUTE SOUNDED WHEN THIS GUY PLAYED IT
THEY JUST COULDN'T READ LEAD A NORMAL LIFE
THEY HAD TO COVER THEIR EARS FROM THE HORRIBLE SOUND
BUT I HAVE TO PLAY I WAS BORN TO DO IT I DON'T KNOW WHY
SO THEY WERE ON THE MAIN FLOAT
GUESS WHAT IT WORKED
IT WAS THEN THE PEOPLE OF FRANKSVILLE REALIZED THAT THEY HAD

MUD DIDN'T ANSWER IN FACT MUD WAS ASLEEP
FOR EXAMPLE MISTER PEEKS LOCATED SHELL CLEANER WOULD SAY HEY THE SWISH ER HEY THERE SWISH DO YOU WANT A FREE SHELL WAXING TODAY
THE WINNER OF THE GREAT TURTLE RACE WAS SO IMPORTANT THAT HE DIDN'T HAVE TO MOVE FOR FOUR YEARS UNTIL THE NEXT FESTIVAL
MUD KNEW THAT HE WOULD THAT THIS WAS BEING THE CLOSEST RACE HE HAD EVER WAS ACTUALLY GETTING A LITTLE BIT SCARED
FINALLY AFTER THE LONG JOURNEY ALL THE TURTLES ARRIVED AT THE GREAT POND
THE TURTLES ALL STRETCHED AND S THOUGHT REALLY SLOW SLOW THOUGHTS AS THEY DID THE SKY TURNED FROM BLACK TO DARK BLUE
HE WOULD NEVER LOSE THE TURTLE CUP FOR THE REST OF HIS LONG LIFE

ALL THE TURTLES IN BLUE POND HELD A MEETING TO DISCUSS THE PROBLEM
THEN SNAPPED OUT OF IT AND REMEMBERED HIS FATHER HAD WARNED HIM OUT OF HIS TRICK
WHEN MUD W IN WAS IN HIS PRIME THERE WAS A NEW TURTLE B BORN IN THE BLUE POND THIS TURTLE WAS NAMED SWISH
THAT'S NOT A ROCK SWEETIE THAT'S MOM THAT'S MUD
WHEN SWISH WAS BORN EVERYONE THOUGHT HE WAS W A LITTLE SLOW BUT HE GOT A LITTLE OLDER AND THE OLDER TURTLES BEGAN TO REALIZE THAT SWISH WAS REALLY REALLY SLOW
THEY WERE VERY FAR PROUD T HE GAVE MUD SUCH A CLOSE RACE SWISH WAS HAPPY TOO BUT DEEP DOWN INSIDE HE KNEW HE WAS JUST AS SLOW AS MUD
THIS MEANS WE WILL THAT WE HAVE A NEW CHAMPION THE REAL WINNER IS SWISH SOFTBELLY OF BLUE POND THE CROWD WENT WILD
THE TURTLE CUP WAS A TROPHY THAT THE WINNER COULD TAKE HOME TO THEIR VILLAGE
MUD WAS THE CLOSEST TURTLE TO THE STARTING LINE
SWISH READ THE RULES EVEN THOUGH HE KNEW BY HEART H H HE KNEW THEM BY HEART THEN HE HEARD THE MAYOR SAY RUNNER'S PLEASE TAKE YOUR POSITIONS
YOU'RE JUST TRYING TO MAKE ME QUIT
THEY WERE BOTH MOVING OF COURSE BECAUSE BUT THEY WERE SO SLOW THAT IT WAS HARD TO TELL
THE SUN THE CROWD THOUGHT HE MUST HAVE REALIZED HIS SINGING TRICK WASN'T WORKING
HE WASN'T AS SLOW AS YOU A AS SLOW AS YOU BUT HE DID TEACH ME ABOUT MUD'S DIRTY T TRICKS
WHEN HE WHISPERED IN SWISH'S EAR ALL THE TRICKS THAT THE GREAT GREAT GRAND TURTLE TAUGHT HIM
SO WITH SWISH THEY TH THEY THOUGHT MAYBE JUST MAYBE HE COULD BRING IT BACK TO BRING BACK THE TURTLE CUP TO THEIR LITTLE POND
WHAT WHAT WOULD YOU LIKE TO SAY TO ALL THE TURTLES TO THE FESTIVAL THE CROWD STARTED YELLING SPEECH SPEECH
WHERE THERE WAS LOTS OF EATING AND LAUGHING TURTLES COULD CATCH UP WITH THEIR FRIENDS THEY HAD NOT SEEN SINCE THE LAST FESTIVAL
WHEN THE TIME CAME FOR THE FESTIVAL DREW NEAR
THIS WAS THE KIND OF THING THAT SWISH WOULD GET ALL THE TIME
HE WOULD TAKE IT MANY MORE TIMES AFTER THAT
HE HADN'T M HADN'T HAD TO MOVE FOR OVER FIFTY YEARS
I'M NOT AFRAID OF STUPID MUD
MUD WAS ACTUALLY SUNG HIMSELF TO SLEEP
THEY READ RULE NUMBER ONE THE GREAT RACE BEGINS AT SUNRISE AND ENDS AT SUNSET
THIS WAS SWISH'S FIRST EVER SHELL DWELLERS FESTIVAL AND HE THOUGHT THAT IT IT WAS THE MOST WONDERFUL THING HE HAD EVER SEEN
THE LAST TURTLE OR THE LESS A TURTLE MOVES THE BIGGER THEY GOT S AND THE LONGER THEY LIVE
WHO IS WAS THIS YOUNG PUNK HE THOUGHT TO HIMSELF MUD AND SAID TO SWISH THERE'S NO WAY THAT THAT A TURTLE AS YOUNG AS YOU CAN BE AS SLOW
BUT THROUGH THOUGH HE BECAME THE GREATEST BI AND BIGGEST TURTLE OF ALL TIME
SO ONE DAY HIS PARENTS HIS PAR TOLD HIS PARENTS I DON'T WANT TO RACE
THEY LOOK AT THE HORIZON AND SAW THE SUN WAS STARTING THE RISE JUST THEN THE MAYOR SAID READY SET SLOW AND OFF THEY WENT
HOW COME THEY DON'T MOVE THAT BIG ROCK OUT OF THE FIELD IT SEEMS THAT EVERYONE'S IN THE WAY SAID SWISH
HIS NAME WAS MUD AND HE WAS THE GREATEST CHAMPION OF HIS OF IN THE HISTORY OF SHELL DWELLER'S FESTIVAL HE WAS UNBEATABLE
TH HE WAS TIRED FROM RACING THOUGH HE WOULD NICE JUST TO LISTEN TO MUD'S SWEET VOICE AND FALL ASLEEP
SWISH WAS SAD THAT HE HAD LOST BUT ALL THE TURTLES FROM BLUE POND CHEERED FOR SWISH
THE SLOWEST TURTLE
SO YOU CAN SEE THE WINNING G GREAT RACE IS A GREAT HONOR
WHEN MUD TRIED ANOTHER TRICK HE STARTED SINGING A SOFT BEAUTIFUL LULLABY SWISH STARTED YAWNING
THEN THE SUNSET WENT DOWN
RULE NUMBER FOUR NO TURTLE MAY FALL ASLEEP SINCE YOU SINCE IF ARE ASLEEP YOU AREN'T RUNNING AS FAST AS YOU CAN
SWISH WAS SUDDENLY VERY EXCITED HE TOLD HIS MOM YOU KNOW WHAT I'M GOING TO WIN THIS RACE
BUT SWISH WOULDN'T LET MUD SCARE HIM
IT TOOK IT LOOKED AS IF NEITHER OF THEM HAD MOVED AT ALL
SWISHES FATHER SAID SON I HAVE SOMETHING TO TELL YOU AS YOU KNOW YOUR GREAT GREAT GRAND TURTLE RACED MUD ONCE
MUD KEPT SINGING HIS LULLABY FOR A FEW HOURS BUT THEN HE STOPPED RIGHT BEFORE SUNSET
THEY THEY ALL FELT A LITTLE SAD BECAUSE THEY HADN'T HELD THE TURTLE CUP IN OVER SEVEN HUNDRED YEARS
HE ANNOUNCED WELL MUD IT LOOKS LIKE YOU'VE DONE IT SLUDGE POND WINS THE TURTLE CUP AGAIN THIS IS THE TIME IT WOULD BE A A BIT NEXT TIME IT WOULD BE A LITTLE BIT CLOSER THAN YOU WOULD HAVE LIKED I I'LL BET
WE NEVER THOUGHT OF THAT THEY ALL SAID THE TOWN AGREED TO TREAT SWISH LIKE A NORMAL TURTLE AND AFTER A WHILE SWISH DECIDED THAT HE WOULD PROUD HE WOULD BE PROUD TO RACE FOR HIS VILLAGE
MISTER PEEKS WOULD NEVER DO ANYTHING FOR FREE BUT HE WAS GOING TO GIVE SWISH A FREE WELL S SH SHELLS WAXING
THE CROWD WENT WILD AGAIN SWISH TOOK THE CUP THAT DAY FOR THE FIRST TIME
I KNOW IT AND THESE TURTLES WILL KNOW THAT BLUE POND RULES
HE WAS THE SLOWEST TURTLE OF ALL TIME
A FAT TURTLE IS A SLOW TURTLE
RULE NUMBER THREE NO TURTLE MAY PRETEND TO GO FASTER BUT GO SLOW INSTEAD ALL TURTLES MUST GO AS FAST AS THEY CAN AT ALL TIMES
LOOK THERE'S YOUR COUSIN PEEK A BOO FROM BIG PUDDLE VILLAGE SWISH'S MOTHER SAID
HE WAS ALWAYS MADE SURE THAT NO ONE TREATED HIM SPECIAL THAT HE AND THAT HE TREATED EVERYONE LIKE HE WANTED TO BE TREATED LIKE A TURTLE WITH HONOR
THE MAYOR DOCTOR SOFTSHELL SAID THIS IS RIDICULOUS SWISH HAS TO RACE HEAR HE IS THE SLOWEST TURTLE I'VE EVERY SEEN EXCEPT FOR MUD OF COURSE WITHOUT HIM I DON'T HAVE WE DON'T HAVE A CHANCE
AFTER A FEW HOURS MOST OF THE TURTLES HAD GONE A FEW FEET
SWISH MADE A LOUD GULP SOUND
HE REACHED I HE REACHED IN T HIS SHELL AND PULLED OUT A COUPLE OF EARPLUGS
WHEN HIS MOTHER CALLED HIM IN FOR DINNER HE DIDN'T MAKE IT HOME UNTIL BREAKFAST THE NEXT MORNING AND HE WAS ONLY A FOOT AWAY
THE MAYOR OF PONDLAND WENT TO PRESENT THE TURTLE CUP TO SLUDGE POND AGAIN
EVERY FOUR YEARS TURTLES FROM ALL OVER THE LAND WOULD CRAWL TO THE GREAT POND
MRS TORT WENT UP TO SWISH GAVE HIM THE TURTLE CUP SHE SAID SWISH YOU ARE THE YOUNGEST WINNER OF THE GREAT TURTLE RACE THAT WAS THE MOST EXCITING FINISH I'VE EVER HAD
THE SLOWEST TURTLES FROM EACH POND WERE CARRIED TO THE STARTING LINE BY MEMBERS OF THEIR VILLAGES
AFTER SIX HOURS MUD AND SWISH WERE STILL TIED AND ONLY MOVED A FEW INCHES
BUT THEN BUT THEN RIGHT AT THE END RIGHT BEFORE THE SUNSET SWISH STARTED TO PULL AHEAD OF MUD
MUD DIDN'T ANSWER THE MAYOR TAPPED MUD ON THE SH SHELL AND SAID HELLO HELLO MUD
EVERYONE TREATED SWISH DIFFERENTLY
AFTER SEVEN DAYS OF PLAYING AND DANCING A BUG EATING FINALE THE DAY OF THE RACE CAME
ALL TURTLES IN THE LAND STARTED T TOWARDS THE GREAT POND SWISH HAD TO BE CARRIED ON HIS FATHER'S BACK SINCE IT WOULD HAVE TO TAKE HIM MONTHS TO GET TO GREAT POND BY HIMSELF
EVERYTHING ABOUT THE FESTIVAL WAS FUN BUT THE MAIN EVENT WAS THE GREAT TURTLE RACE
IT WAS BECAUSE OF SWISH THAT BLUE POND BECAME THE MOST RESPECTED POND IN THE LAND
THERE WERE ABOUT THREE HUNDRED TURTLES RACING THEY WERE ALL THE SLOWEST OF THE SLOW
SWISH'S MOM SMILED AND SAID I KNOW YOU CAN WIN SWISH BUT IT'S AN HONOR JUST TO GET TO RACE SAID SWISH'S MOM
HE WAS ONE OF THE BIGGEST AND MOST RESPECTED AND ALSO ONE OF THE TRICKIEST TURTLES THERE WAS
HOW DID IT HAPPEN I'M NOT EXACTLY SURE MAMA SISTER SAID BUT SOME OF THEM ARE GETTING SORE
NOT PERFECTLY IT'S HARD TO BREAK A HABIT SISTER HAD TO GIVE BACK SOME PENNIES OF THE SOME OF THE BACK HAD TO GIVE BACK SOME OF THOSE PENNIES BUT IN TEN DAYS SHE HAD NINETY THREE PENNIES
I'LL NEVER NIBBLE AGAIN SHE SAID AS SHE THOUGHT OF ALL THOSE LOVELY DIMES SHE WAS GOING TO GET
THE NEXT MORNING WHEN SISTER LINED UP FOR SCHOOL LIZZY BRUIN AND SOME OTHER OTHERS BEGAN POINTING AT HER AND TEASING SISTER NIBBLES HER NAILS SISTER NIBBLES HER NAILS IT DIDN'T TAKE SISTER LONG TO DECIDE MMM LONG TO DECIDE TO IT DIDN'T TAKE SISTER LONG TO DECIDE TO PULL OFF THOSE BITS OF TAPE
I CERTAINLY HOPE YOU'RE JOKING ROARED PAPA BECAUSE IF YOU'RE NOT I'M JOKING I'M JOKING INTERRUPTED BROTHER AND HE WAS SORT OF
DEAR ME NO SAID MAMA NAIL BITING IS A KIND OF NERVOUS HABIT AND SHOUTING AT AND SHOUTING AND THREATENING WILL JUST MAKE HER MORE NERVOUS
AND THE NEXT TIME SHE PLAYED JACKS WHEN SHE GOT ALL SHE GOT ALL THE WAY UP TO THE TENSIES
MY MAMA HELPED ME STOP WHAT YOU HA WHAT HAVE YOU TRIED SO FAR UHM UH HUH WELL I THINK YOU'RE ON WELL I THINK YOU'RE ON THE RIGHT TRACK WITH A DIME BUT INSTEAD OF A DIME AND INSTEAD OF GIVING IT TO HER AT THE END OF THE DAY
WELL SAID MAMA IT'S SORT OF LIKE THIS PATH I'VE WHEELED THIS BARROW OVER IT OVER IT SO MANY TIMES THAT IT'S THAT IT'S WELL IT'S WORN A DEEP RUT RIGHT DOWN THE MIDDLE AND IT KEEPS GETTING DEEPER EVERY TIME I USE IT
LIZZY TWIRLED HER FUR TWIRL TWIRL TWIRL FREDDY SCRATCHED HIS HEAD SCRATCH SCRATCH SCRATCH NORMAN SUCKED HIS THUMB SUCK SUCK SUCK SIS AND SISTER NIBBLED HER NAILS NIBBLE NIBBLE NIBBLE NIBBLE
FIRST THERE HAD BEEN A NURSERY SCHOOL WHERE WHICH WAS PURE FUN PLAYING WITH DOLLS BLOCKS ROLLING CLAY SNAKES AND SCRIBBLING WITH CRAYONS
I SUPPOSE SO SAID PAPA THOUGHTFULLY PERHAPS SOME SORT OF REWARD WOULD HELP A BIT OF MONEY LET'S SAY A DIME FOR EVERY DAY SHE DOESN'T BITE HER NAILS
YOU JUST NEED A LITTLE HELP THAT'S ALL SAID MAMA LET'S LET'S PLANT GRAN'S TULIPS WHILE I THINK ABOUT IT AND LATER I'LL TALK TO YOUR PAPA HE HE MAY HAVE SOME IDEAS
THE THE BITS OF TAPE HELPED SISTER REMEMBER REMEMBER NOT TO NIBBLE BUT THEY A BUT THEY ALSO GOT IN THE WAY WHEN SHE TRIED TO DO CERTAIN THINGS
BUT EVEN BETTER SHE HAD TEN FINE FINGERNAILS
A DAY IS A LONG TIME AND HABITS ARE POWERFUL ESPECIALLY BAD HABITS EVEN WITH THE PROMISE OF A DIME SISTER COULDN'T REMEMBER NOT TO NIBBLE MAMA AND PAPA GOT DISCOURAGED TOO
HABITS ARE VERY IMPORTANT UH IS A HABITS ARE A VERY IMPORTANT L PART OF OUR LIVES MOST OF THEM ARE GOOD BRUSHING YOUR TEETH AND COMBING YOUR FUR WHEN YOU GET UP IN THE MORNING AND LOOKING BOTH WAYS BEFORE YOU CROSS A ROAD BUT SOME HABITS AREN'T SO GOOD
BUT IT WASN'T ALL FUN THERE THERE WAS QUITE A LOT OF WORK SPELLING NUMBER PROBLEMS ALL KINDS OF THINGS
IT WAS VERY HARD TO HOLD A PENCIL WITH TAPE ALL OVER YOUR FINGERTIPS OR TURN ON THE TV OR SCRATCH WHEN YOU HAVE AN ITCH WHEN SIS WHEN SIS AND WHEN SISTER TRIED TO PLAY JACKS SHE COULDN'T GET ANY
THAT'S WHEN BR BROTHER BEAR LOOKED AT HIS FINGERNAILS AND PIPED UP YOU KNOW I THINK I MIGHT START BITING MY F NAILS I COULD USE SOME MONEY
THAT'S THAT'S THE WAY IT IS WITH YOUR BAD HABIT MORE YOU GET USE IT THE HARDER IT IS TO TO GET IT OUT OF IT HERE THIS IS THAT I WANT THIS IS WHERE I WANT TO PLANT THE BULBS
BEFORE SHE KNEW IT IT BEFORE SHE KNEW IT SHE HAD NIBBLED THEM DOWN TO NUBBINS IN FACT SHE NIBBLED THEM SO FAR THAT SOME OF HER FINGERS WERE GETTING SORE
SO THEY TRIED GRAN'S IDEA INSTEAD OF A DIME AT THE END OF EACH DAY THEY THEY THEY GAVE SIS SISTER TEN PENNIES FOR EACH NAIL AT THE BEGINNING OF ONE FOR EACH NAIL AT THE BEGINNING OF THE DAY TEN PENNIES TO KEEP UNLESS SHE NIBBLED
BEFORE MAMA BEFORE MAMA COULD ANSWER SISTER BEAR W WHO HAD BEEN NERVOUSLY NIBBLING IN THE NEXT ROOM POPPED IN AND SAID A DIME TEN W WHOLE CENTS EVERY DAY FOR DAY JUST FOR NOT BITING MY NAILS
BUT WORST OF ALL BITS OF TAPE BUT WORST OF ALL THE BITS OF TAPE TOLD THE WHOLE WORLD SISTER BEAR WAS A NAIL BITER
GET OUT OF IT
HMM SAID MAMA WELL H HERE'S WHAT WE'LL DO WE'LL PUT A LITTLE M MEDI MEDICINE ON THE SORES ONE ON THE SORE ONES AND BITS OF AD ADHESIVE TAPE ON ALL OF THEM THAT WILL REMIND YOU NOT NOT TO NIBBLE AND GET BACK AND WILL GIVE THEM A CHANCE TO GROW BACK
BUT THE WAY IT TURNED OUT SHE NEVER SHE DIDN'T GET A SINGLE DIME ALL SHE GOT WAS DISCOURAGED
NOW SISTER WAS IN FIRST GRADE REGULAR SCHOOL WAS DIFFERENT SH IT WAS STILL FUN AND SHE LIKED TEACHER JANE VERY MUCH BUT IT WASN'T ALL F IT WASN'T
A HABIT MAMA SAID AS SHE PUSHED THE WHEELBARROW ALONG THE WELL WORN PATH IS SOMETHING YOU DO SO OFTEN YOU DON'T EVEN HAVE TO THINK ABOUT IT
THE BERENSTAIN BEARS AND THE BAD HABIT
PHEW SAID PAPA BEAR I'M GLAD THAT'S OVER YES INDEED AGREED MAMA BREATHING A GREAT SIGH OF RELIEF
WHAT AND INTERESTING IDEA SAID MAMA AS SHE LISTENED TO THE WISE TO WISE OLD GR GRIZZLY GRAN
WHY IT'S SO DEEP NOW I CAN'T I CAN'T GET OUT OF I CAN'T GET OUT OF IT WITH A LI I CAN'T GET OUT I GET I CAN'T GET OUT I CAN'T I CAN'T GET OUT OF IT WITHOUT A LITTLE HELP
NEXT CAME KINDERGARTEN
THAN TWOSIES THAN TWOSIES
I COULD READ THE RIOT ACT TO HER SUGGESTED PAPA YOU KNOW NAIL BITING IS AN OUTRAGEOUS DISGRACEFUL HABIT AND IF AND IF YOU DON'T STOP IT IMMEDIATELY
GREAT FOR PICKING THINGS UP TURNING ON THE TV AND SCRATCHING ITCHES
OH WELL SIGHED MAMA LIFE GOES ON I CALL GRAN AND AND THANK HER FOR THE TULIP TULIP BULB MM BULBS OH YOU'RE VERY WELCOME MY DEAR SAID GRAN WHEN MAMA CALLED AND HOW IS EVERYTHING AT YOUR HOUSE IS THAT SO YOU KNOW I WAS A NAIL BITER WHEN I WAS A CUB
LIKE NAIL BITING SISTER ASKED YOU WOULD LIKE TO HAVE YOU NI NICE NAILS GROW BACK WOULDN'T YOU WAS MAMA'S BEAR WAS MAMA'S ANSWER
OH YES SAID SISTER BUT I KEEP FORGETTING WHY IS IT SO WHY IS IT HARD TO REMEMBER
IN REGULAR SCHOOL YOU HAVE TO CONCENTRATE SOME SOME AND SOMETIMES WHEN YOU CONCENTRATE YOU FORM LITTLE NERVOUS HABITS AND THAT'S WHAT HAPPENED TO SOME CUBS IN TEACHER JANE'S CLASS
SISTER BEAR WHO LIVED WHO LIVED WITH HER MAMA AND PAPA AND HER BROTHER IN THE BIG TREE HOUSE DOWN A SUNNY DIRT ROAD DEEP IN BEAR COUNTRY HAD BEEN GOING TO SCHOOL FOR QUITE A WHILE
SHE COULDN'T HIGHER THAN
WHAT ABOUT MY NAIL BITING HABIT ASKED SISTER AS SHE HELPED MAMA GET OUT OF THE DEEP RUT HOW AM I GOING TO GET RID OF IT
AND THOSE PENNIES AND WITH THOSE PENNIES IN HER POCKET JIGGLING WHEN SHE GOT ON THE SCHOOL BUS JING JINGLING WHEN SHE JUMPED ROPE IN THE SCHOOLYARD JUST WAITING TO REM JUST WAITING TO BE REMEMBERED WHEN SOME NAIL DECIDED IT NEEDED A NIBBLE THE PLAN WORKED
OH DEAR SAID MAMA MAMA BEAR TO SISTER WHEN THE CUBS GOT HOME FROM SCHOOL ONE DAY YOU'VE NIBBLED YOUR DA YOU'VE NIBBLED YOUR NAILS DOWN TO NUBBINS IN FACT YOU'VE NIBBLED THEM CLEAN OFF
THAT'S RIGHT SAID PAPA UNTIL THE HABIT'S BROKEN
N NEXT HAD COME KINDERGARTEN THAT WAS FUN TOO TH THERE WERE MARCHING GAMES AND A RHYTHM BAND SHE ALSO LEARNED A LOT OF NUMBERS IN KINDERGARTEN AND MOST OF THE ALPHABET
I COULD USE THE MONEY
BUT PHYSICALLY FITNESS WAS NOT THE ONLY REASON THAT FRED LOVED THE PANDAS THE OTHER
BUT YIN YIN THE YOUNG PANDA
I'M SORRY TO SAY BUT MANY BUT MANY A LITTLE BOY'S CHEEKS HAVE BEEN MADE RAW WHEN MOTHER POO POO PANDA WAS UPSET
THIS CAN ALMOST CERTAINLY BE ACCOUNTED FOR BY THIS STRANGE ALMOST MAGICAL EFFECT THAT THE PANDAS POSSESS
TALKING ABOUT SINCE THEY HADN'T THOUGHT OR TALKED OF MUCH ELSE SINCE YIN YIN SAID I WANT TO GO THERE AND POINTED TO THE MOON
BACK IN THE PANDA'S HOME THE MOON PANDA MOTHER PANDA POO POO WAS VERY PROUD OF HER DAUGHTER
SHE COULD BE A VERY PERSUASIVE LITTLE BIRD WHEN SHE WHEN SHE WANT WHEN SHE WANTED
THAT IS JUST THE TYPE OF EXPOSURE WE NEEDED THOSE PANDAS WILL BE WITH US FOR A LONG TIME
IT IT WOULDN'T BE BEST TO FLY
YES BUT WHAT DOES THAT HAVE TO DO WITH PANDAS MAN
HOW TO TURN YOUR HEAD ALL THE WAY AROUND WITHOUT GETTING A TERRIBLE PAIN IN THE NECK SAID OWL
LIKELY NOT MADE OF CHEESE AND MOST CERTAINLY NOT MADE OF BAMBOO YIN YIN AND HER BEST FRIEND MAGGIE THE MAGPIE WHO LOOKED LIKE A PANDA WOULD LOOK IF PANDAS WERE BIRDS WERE DISCUSSING ABOUT H GOING TO THE MOON
THE MAIN OBSTACLE IT TURNS OUT GETTING THE ROCKET SHIP OFF THE GROUND
WHY HE WAS FEEDING THE PANDAS LIKE HE WAS SUPPOSED TO
SUCH NONSENSE GOING TO THE MOON SAID HER MOTHER POO POO
FRED WAS NOT ALLOWED TO ACTUALLY HUG THE PANDA BEARS SINCE THEY COULD BE DANGEROUS SO ALL THE OTHER PEOPLE AT THE ZOO COULD WOULD KNOW THAT THE PANDAS HAD JUST BEEN FED WHEN THEY SAW FRED HUGGING
FRED FRED FRED FED THE PANDA BEARS THE TIGERS AND TURTLES THE TURTLES WEREN'T SO BAD BUT AS FOR THE TIGERS HE WASN'T SO SURE
MOON
I THINK THAT THE ZOO NEEDS IT'S A GREAT AD ADVERTISING CAMPAIGN
EIGHT EIGHTY FIVE POINT FIVE DEGREE SPOT ON HIS LEFT KIDNEY BUT THE POINT IS THAT HE WAS VERY FOND OF FEEDING THE PANDAS
IS A DECIDEDLY ROUND ABOUT WAY TO GO IF YOU MUST GO IT
REAS REASON WAS THAT ANY WHO ANYONE WHO GETS WITHIN THREE FEET OF A PANDA AUTOMATICALLY FALLS IN LOVE WITH THEM
A QUICKER WAY TO GET TO GET AROUND EUROPE IN ORDER TO IMPROVE TRADE
OH WISE OWL I HAVE A QUESTION THAT I FEAR ONLY YOU CAN ANSWER SHE SAID
WAS NOT LISTENING TO FRED SHE WAS TALKING TO HER BEST FRIEND MAGGIE THE MAGPIE ABOUT GOING TO THE MOON YES THE BIG ONE IN THE SKY THAT IS ALMOST LIKE
YIN YIN WAS ALWAYS ONE TO MAKE GOOD ADVICE FOR HIS FATHER AND LESS THAN A WEEK LATER YIN YIN AND MAGGIE HAD BUILT A ROCKET SHIP OUT OF BAMBOO
ONE MORNING FRED WAS FEEDING YIN YIN AND SAID OH YIN YIN I WISH THAT MORE PEOPLE COULD COME TO VISIT THE ZOO
THAT ONCE YOU COULD OVER ONE THOUSAND MAGPIES TOGETHER THEY TEND TO FIGHT AND CAN'T AGREE ON A SINGLE THING
GOING TO THE MOON INDEED NONSENSE YOUR JOB IS TO BE S
BUT LATER WHEN FRED WALKED INTO THE PANDA'S HOME UNDER A HIS NEW YELLOW UMBRELLA ALL SHE COULD THINK TO SAY WAS NONSENSE
IT'S A LAW OF NATURE
WHY DID A PANDA WITH THE BEAUTIFUL GIRL NAME YIN YIN HAVE HER NAME CHANGED TO THE VERY UN BEAUTIFUL GIRL NAME COLUMBUS
ACTUALLY IT WAS A EIGHT
I SEE FRED ONE MORE THING SIR ABOUT THOSE MAGPIES FLYING ABOVE THE PANDAS DO YOU THINK THAT THE ZOO COULD PURCHASE M ME A LARGE SIZE SIZED UMBRELLA
THE OWL INSTANTLY REPLIED TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND AND SEVENTY SIX GIVE OR TAKE TWO
THEY SAID TOGETHER PULLING WITH ALL THEIR MIGHT I SEE YOUR WINGS FLAPPING BUT WE DON'T SEEM TO BE GOING ANYWHERE SAID YIN YIN
IT'S TAKEN ME A COUPLE OF WEEKS TO FIGURE IT OUT BUT I THINK YIN YIN WANTS TO GO TO THE MOON AND THE MAGPIES WANT TO TAKE HER THERE SAID FRED
SHE SAID PIT SPITEFULLY
RATHER UN CUDDLY PALM TREE OUTSIDE OF THE PANDAS HOM HOME
HER MOTHER THE F HER MOTHER AND FATHER KNEW THAT THEY WERE
SO BEFORE HE RAN OFF TO HUG THE PALM TREE QUICKLY SAID IT COSTS SO MUCH TO FEED YOU PANDAS I WOULD HATE IF YOU HAD TO LEAVE US AFTER ALL IT'S THE ONLY HOME YOU KNOW
THEY WERE IN ORDER OF CUTENESS YIN YIN THE YOUNG DAUGHTER POO POO THE MOTHER AND MOO MAN THE GENTLE AND ALWAYS SLEEPY FATHER
YIN YIN'S FATHER MOO MAN DIDN'T THINK IT WAS VERY PROPER T OR WISE FOR A YOUNG PANDA BEAR TO GO ROLLING OFF TO PLACES WHERE THERE WASN'T ANY BAMBOO
THE ZOO KEEPER SAID GOOD HEAVENS MAN THAT IS A GREAT IDEA NO WAIT A SECOND I DON'T UNDERSTAND WELL SIR WHEN COLUMBUS SET OUT ON HIS SHIP HE WAS REALLY TRYING TO FIND
SO MAGGIE FLEW TO THE OWL AND ASKED FOR HIS ADVICE
BUT EVERYTHING WAS NOT ALL BAMBOO AND HUGS AT THE ZOO
ENOUGH OF THIS NONSENSE NONSENSE SAID YIN YIN'S MOTHER POO POO WHAT SORT OF NONSENSE IS THIS FOR A YOUNG PANDA BEAR
A WEEK LATER DESPITE MUCH FLAPPING THEY WERE STILL TRYING TO GET THE ROCKET IN THE AIR IT TURNS OUT THAT THE OWL DIDN'T TAKE THE CONSIDERATION THAT ONE
NO ONE COULD BLAME FRED REALLY SINCE NO ONE REALLY WANTS TO BE EATEN
AFTER ALL IF IT WEREN'T FOR YIN YIN THEY WOULD HAVE HAD TO MOVE FOR THEIR WONDERFUL HOME FROM THEIR WONDERFUL HOME
FRED THOUGHT ABOUT IT AND SAID YOU KNOW I THINK WE SHOULD RENAME YIN YIN COLUMBUS
AS FOR YIN YIN SHE WAS VERY PROUD TO RE TO BE RENAMED AFTER A FAMOUS EXPLORER AND SHE AND MAGGIE NEVER STOPPED TRYING TO GET TO THE MOON
THE PANDA
SOME PEOPLE DO LIKE TO BITE THEIR FINGER NAILS BUT EACH AFTERNOON AT THREE O'CLOCK WHEN IT WAS TIME TO FEED THE TIGERS FOR FRED WHEN IT CAME TO PANDAS HE HAD A WARM SPOT IN HIS HEART
PANDAS MAN SAID THE ZOO MANAGER WELL IT SEEMS TO ME SIR THAT YIN YIN WANTED TO BE A GREAT EXPLORER INSTEAD BECAME A BUSINESS WOMAN
NONSENSE SAID THE MOTHER I'M SO MAD I'M GOING TO LOOK AT THE LADY OVER THERE AND MAKE HER WANT TO SQUEEZE HER SON CHEEKS
NO HOW MANY MAGPIE'S WOULD BE NEEDED TO FLY A FOUR HUNDRED POUND PANDA BEAR AND A ONE HUNDRED POUND BAMBOO ROCKET SHIP TO THE MOON SAID MAGGIE
MAGGIE FIGURED THAT IF SHE AND THREE OF THE STRONGEST MAGPIE FRIENDS WERE TO EACH GRAB HOLD OF A CORNER OF THE ROCKET SHIP THEY COULD FLY TO THE MOON SO THEY TRIED ONE TWO THREE TO THE MOON
BUT I JUST LEARNED HOW TO MAKE MYSELF INTO A BALL AND ROLL TWO DAYS AGO AND I'VE BECOMING VERY GOOD AT IT
SO ONE DAY AFTER FRED HAD FED THE PAN PANDAS AND HE WAS HUGGING THE PLA PALM TREE THE ZOO MANAGER CAME UP TO HIM AND SAID WHAT IS GOING ON WITH Y YOUR PANDAS FRED I'VE NEVER SEEN ANYTHING LIKE IT
HE DIDN'T MIND HANDLING THE RAW MEAT HE HAD TO FEED
FRED WAS STARTING TO FEEL THE UNCONTROLLABLE URGE TO HUG THE PANDA
I DON'T THINK IT WILL TAKE THAT LONG TO ROLL THERE SAID YIN YIN
THERE WERE THERE PAN THERE WERE THREE PANDAS AND THEY WERE KNOWN AS THE PAN FAMILY
HE WANTED TO BE A BUSINESS MAN BUT INSTEAD BECAME A GREAT EXPLORER
I KNOW I SHOULDN'T BE TELLING YOU THIS BUT WE MIGHT HAVE TO SELL YOU AND YOUR FAMILY TO THE ZOO IN SAN ANGELES IF WE DIDN'T DON'T GET MORE MONEY
BAMBOO IS VERY WORKABLE SUBSTANCE AND PANDAS TEND TO HANDLE BAMBOO A LOT SO THIS IN ITSELF WAS NOT THAT ASTONISH ASTONISHING AT LEAST TO YIN YINS PARENTS FRED SURE WAS IMPRESSED THOUGH
IS TO BE CUTE SO PEOPLE WANT TO RUN THE GIFT SHOP AND BUY PANDA BEAR DOLLS IT'S INDUSTRY WHICH YOUNG LADY HELPS PAY FOR THE BAMBOO THAT YOU EAT
NOW WHILE ALL THIS WAS GOING ON WHAT DO YOU THINK S WHAT DO YOU SUPPOSED FRED WAS DOING
AT FURTHER DISTANCE PANDAS HAVE A STRANGE ALMOST MAGICAL EFFECT ON HUMAN BEINGS WHICH MAKES US WANT TO HUG AND SQUEEZE THINGS
IT WAS FRED'S IDEA SO L LET'S BEGIN WITH FRED
IT'S NOT THAT YOU AREN'T SELLING ENOUGH STUFFED PANDA BEARS IT'S JUST THAT THERE HAVEN'T BEEN ENOUGH PEOPLE COMING TO SEE YOU IN THE FIRST PLACE
THE ZOO MANAGER LAUGHED AND WALKED AWAY BUT DID PURCHASE A FASHIONABLE YELLOW UMBRELLA FOR FRED THE NEXT DAY
A WEEK LATER MAGGIE MANAGED TO ROUND UP TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND AND SEVENTY S EIGHT MAGPIE
HMM HEAVIER THAN I THOUGHT I THINK WE BETTER I THINK WE'LL NEED MORE MAGPIES SAID MAGGIE YES BUT HOW ABOUT MANY YES BUT HOW MANY MORE YIN YIN SAID I'M NOT SURE EXACTLY REPLIED MAGGIE
OH WELL THAT MAKES SENSE SAID THE MANAGER DID YOU KNOW THAT SINCE THE LITTLE PANDA BUILT THE BAMBOO ROCKET SHIP AND THOSE MAGPIE'S STARTED FLUTTERING ABOUT THAT THE ZOO'S PROFITS HAVE GONE UP FOUR FOUR THOUSAND PERCENT T
IT IS INTERESTING TO POINT AT THIS TIME THAT MORE STUFFED PANDA BEARS ARE SOLD AT ZOO GIFT SHOPS THEN ALL OF THE OTHER STUFF ANIMALS COMBINED
AN INSTANT LATER A YOUNG BOY WAS HEARD SAYING OUCH MOM CUT THAT OUT
TO THE TIGERS HE MEAN HIS MAIN OBJECT WAS TO BEGIN EATEN
BESIDES IF YOU LEAVE I'LL GET TERRIBLY OUT OF SHAPE NOW IF YOU EXCUSE ME I NEED TO SQUEEZE SOMETHING BEFORE I SCREAM
THE FATHER WATCHED THIS ALL THROUGH ONE EYE FOR HE ALWAYS HAD AT LEAST ONE EYE ASLEEP AT ALL TIMES SAID T'WOULD BE BEST TO ASK THE OWL THEN CLOSED HIS EYE
BUT HE WAS SUPPORTIVE OF HIS YOUNG DAUGHTER AND SHOWED HIS SUPPORT TAKING A N NAP
MANY PEOPLE KNOW THAT PANDAS EAT BAMBOO A LOT OF IT A LOT OF BAMBOO CAN GET QUITE HEAVY SO BECAUSE OF THE PANDAS FRED CAME VERY STRONG AND WAS IN TERRIFIC SHAPE
BESIDES EVERYBODY LOVED JOHN SINCE HE HAD BECOME THE TOWN DE DENTIST EVERYBODY'S TEETH WERE MUCH WHITER AND CLEANER AND NO ONE HAD ANY CAVITIES
HE WAS THE NEW TOWN DENTIST HE WAS AN EXCELLENT DENTIST
CAME UP WITH AN IDEA HE THOUGHT THAT IF HE MADE A NEW MOUTHPIECE ESPECIALLY SHAPED FOR JOHN'S MOUTH THEN PERHAPS HE COULD PLAY THE FLUTE NORMALLY
THEIR PROBLEMS STARTED WITH WHEN THEY RAN OUT OF WATER
NO ONE COULD HEAR ANYTHING PEOPLE WERE GETTING INTO CAR ACCIDENTS AND EVERYBODY LOOKED REALLY SILLY AT DANCES
LOOK JOHN I'VE HEARD YOU PLAY THE CLARINET YOU'RE QUITE GOOD WHY DON'T YOU PLAY THAT INSTEAD SAID JEFF SANDERS CHIEF SANDERS
IT'S THE FLUTE SOUND THE FLIES HATE JOHN'S FLUTE PLAYING AS MUCH AS WE DO
THEN A FLY LANDED ON SOMEONE ELSE THEN SOME LANDED ON A BUNCH OF PEOPLE
NO NO PLEASE DON'T PLAY YOUR OLD FLUTE DOCTOR BEGAN BEGGED DOCTOR WONG BUT IT WAS TOO LATE JOHN HAD STARTED PLAYING
DOCTOR WONG THOUGHT FOR A SECOND THAT
HOWEVER FOR SOME REASON THE WAY HIS MOUTH WAS SHAPED MADE HIS FLUTE SOUND AWFUL
MAYBE A POORLY PLAYED FLUTE DOESN'T SOUND ALL THAT BAD BUT JUST TRY TO IMAGINE SOMEONE SCRATCHING A CHALKBOARD WITH A FORK AND THEN MULTIPLY THE TIMES A HUNDRED
ROOSTER JOHN
THAT'S HOW THE FLUTE SOUNDED WHEN THE GUY PLAYED IT
THE FLIES WOULD LAND ALL OVER THE PEOPLE AND THEY C COULDN'T SWIPE AT THEM THEM OFF
EXCELLENT DENTIST HE WAS REAL
AND GUESS WHAT IT WORKED DOCTOR WONG WAS THE TOWN HERO THE FLUTE SOUNDED NORMAL AND IT TURNED OUT JOHN COULD PLAY IT QUITE WELL
BUT SOON AFTER THAT THEY STARTED TO GET FLIES THEY GOT TONS AND TONS OF FLIES
THEN THEY DECIDED TO LOWER HIM DOWN A WELL AND LET HIM PLAY DOWN WHERE NO ONE COULD HEAR HIM
OH THAT'S A NICE INSTRUMENT BUT IT'S JUST NOT THE FLUTE I EVEN WROTE YOU A SONG CHIEF SANDERS IT'S CALLED COPS AND ROBBERS
OH NO SAID
THEN THEY HAD TO COVER THEIR EARS FROM THE HORRIBLE SOUND
PRONOUN PRONOUNCED
SO THEY DECIDED THAT JOHN COULD PLAY THE FLUTE AND EVERYBODY ELSE WOULD HAVE TO WEAR EARPLUGS
HE STARTED SHAKING THE FLUTE TO GET THE FLIES OFF THE OFF AND ACCIDENTALLY SMASHED IT INTO PIECES
THE NEIGHBORS ARE COMPLAINING AND THE CATS AND DOGS ARE TRYING TO CHEW OFF THEIR EARS
CHIEF HATED THE SOUND SO MUCH THAT HE THREW JOHN IN JAIL
DANCING TO MUSIC THEY COULDN'T EVEN HEAR THEY JUST COULDN'T LED A NOR LIVE LEAD A NORMAL LIFE
THANKFULLY SOMEONE WAS DIGGING A HOLE AND FOUND WATER
JOHN THE DENTIST IS DRIVING THE FLIES AWAY
THEN PRETTY SOON TONS OF FLIES WERE LANDING ON EVERYONE BEFORE THEY KNEW IT THE TOWN WAS FILLED WITH FLIES AGAIN
WHEN THE TOWNSFOLKS HEARD THE NOISE THEY COULDN'T EVEN SWAT AT THE FLIES ANYMORE
THEY COULD KEEP JOHN IN JAIL AND THEY DIDN'T WANT TO KICK HIM OUT OF TOWN BECAUSE THEY ALL HAD SUCH NICE TEETH
DOCTOR WONG AND JOHN
WINDOWS WERE BREAKING AND ALL THE COWS IN TOWN STARTED TO MAKE
JOHN DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TO DO SO HE JUST KEPT ON PLAYING HIS FLUTE THE FLIES WERE ANNOYING SO HE WOULD S SWEET SWEAT AT THEM WITH HIS HAND OR EVEN HIS NEW FLUTE
CHEF
WE CAN'T LET YOU PLAY THE FLUTE ANYMORE JOHN SAID POLICE CHEF SANDERS
I'M SERIOUS STILL IT'S NOT AS BAD AS MILLIONS OF FLIES I SUPPOSE
WHAT SHOULD THEY DO
IT WAS GROSS THEN SUDDENLY THE FLIES FLEW AWAY FAST AS THEY COULD
BUT HIS REAL LOVE WAS MUSIC HE PLAYED MANY MUSICAL INSTRUMENTS SUCH AS THE CAR THE GUITAR THE TUBA THE PIANO AND THE CLARINET
JUST THOUGH THAT WAS AN OK JOHN THOUGHT THAT WAS AN OK IDEA BUT THERE WAS AN ECHO IN THE WELL THAT MADE THE FLUTE SOUND LOUDER
THEN THE FLIES STOPPED BUT JUST THEN A MAN MOVED INTO TOWN WHO PLAYED THE FLUTE SO BADLY THAT PEOPLE WOULD RUN AWAY SCREAMING
FROM THEN ON JOHN WOULD WAKE UP AT SUNRISE LIKE A ROOSTER AND PLAY TO KEEP THE FLIES AWAY
THEN HE PLAYED THE SONG THE POLICE
AS BAD AS THE FLUTE SOUNDED IT WAS A LOT BETTER THAN THOUSANDS OF FLIES CRAWLING ON THEM
WERE THE STARS OF THE PARADE THEY WERE UP ON THE MAIN FLOAT BIG BAND PLAYED AS THEY MARCHED UP AND DOWN MAIN STREET EVERYONE CHEERED THEN SUDDENLY A FLY LANDED ON A LITTLE GIRL
SOUR MILK THE LOCAL SCIENTIST DOCTOR WONG
HE WAS VERY UPSET AT FIRST THEN HE SAID OH WELL GOOD THING I BROUGHT MY OLD FLUTE AS BACK UP
WELL I AM SURE YOU GUESSED THAT DIDN'T WORK
BUT I HAVE TO PLAY I WAS BORN TO DO IT I DON'T KNOW WHY BUT I FEEL LIKE I HAVE TO OR ELSE BAD THINGS WILL HAPPEN
THE BAD FLUTE PLAYER WAS ROOSTER JOHN HE WASN'T CALLED ROOSTER JOHN YET THAT CAME AFTER
BUT THEY COULDN'T KEEP JOHN IN JAIL SINCE HE WAS REALLY BREAKING ANY LAWS SO THERE WAS NOTHING THE POLICE COULD DO
SHE LIKED BEING CALLED PEANUT LADY
HE ONCE PLAYED THE GAME I HAD ON MY GAME BOY AND HE COULDN'T EVEN PASS LEVEL ONE
I PLAYED ON MY GAME BOY UNTIL I GOT MY NEW HIGH SCORE
HE WAS REALLY NICE BUT HE WOULDN'T PLAY GO FISH WITH ME
FIVE BUTTONS AND I
UHM SHE HAD TO HELP OTHER PASSENGERS
I'VE ALWAYS THOUGHT FLYING WAS FUN
GRANDPA LAUGHED AND TOOK ME STRAIGHT TO THE ICE CREAM SHOP
I WAS GLAD THAT THERE WASN'T ANYONE NEXT TO ME THE PERSON NEXT TO M TO ME WOULD HAVE BEEN VERY ANNOYED
SH
OF COOL LOOKING DRAGONS TO KEEP ME BUSY
IT WAS THE PEANUTS THAT WERE MAKING ME SO THIRSTY IN THE FIRST PLACE
UHM THE AIRPLANE RIDE
WHEN I GOT OFF THE AIRPLANE
I DIDN'T LIKE TO THINK ABOUT THAT BUT I COULDN'T HELP IT
HE LAUGHED EVEN THOUGH I WASN'T JOKING
IS GOING TOO FAST TO EVER STOP BUT IT DOES
WAS IN THE OVERHEAD THINGY
I STARTED THINKING HE MI WE MIGHT CRASH
SHE WAS THE ONE WHO KEPT TRYING TO GIVE ME PEA PEANUTS
ONE THING ABOUT BEING
THERE'S NO WAY THAT ANYONE CAN REMEMBER TO PUSH TH ALL THESE BUTTONS AT THE RIGHT TIME WE ARE GOING TO CRASH
SHE TOLD ME TO BE QUIET AND WATCH THE MOVIE
THAT'S ALWAYS SCARY IT SEEMED LIKE THE PLANE
CAN'T GET PAST THREE LEVELS
MY PACK MY BACKPACK WAS IN
BUT TO TELL YOU THE TRUTH WITHOUT MY PARENTS THERE I WAS PRETTY NERVOUS
SHE SAID THE CAPTAIN WAS INVITING ME TO S SEE THE COCKPIT
I ONLY USED THE GREEN CRAYON BECAUSE IT WAS THE TALLEST AND I WANTED IT TO CATCH UP WITH THE RED BROWN BLUE YELLOW PURPLE AND BLACK ONES
AT FIRST I THOUGHT WOW LOOK AT ALL THESE BUTTONS THEN I THOUGHT
I DIDN'T KNOW ANYONE AT ALL AND HAD TO GO ALL THE WAY FROM NEW YORK TO TEXAS WITHOUT MY PARENTS
THERE WAS GRANDPA WAITING FOR ME HE SAID HOW WAS YOUR FLIGHT
I HAD SEVEN COLA'S AND FOUR GINGER ALE'S WHICH MADE ME HAVE TO GO TO THE BATHROOM EIGHT TIMES
MY MOM GAVE ME A COLORING BOOK
BUT SOMETIMES PEOPLE LIKE TO EAT PEANUTS ON THEIR BANANA SPLITS SO I TOLD HER THAT
BUT GUESS WHAT I WAS TOO SHORT TO REACH THE BUTTON SO I STARTED YELLING HEY PEANUT LADY HEY PEANUT LADY
THEN HE TOLD ME THAT
THE WAY I FIGURED IT MY GAME BOY ONLY WAS FIVE
THE FLIGHT ATTENDANT GAVE ME A DECK OF CARDS BUT SHE WOULDN'T PLAY GO FISH WITH ME
I SAID IF YOU CAN'T EVEN GET PAST LEVEL ONE AND YOU'RE A PILOT THEN COULDN'T
ME INTO THE COCKPIT AND THERE WAS THERE WERE A MILLION BUTTONS AND LEVERS AND KNOBS AND STUFF
FINALLY WE LANDED
THEN JENNIFER CAME UP TO ME AND SAID SHE HAD A SURPRISE I THOUGHT GREAT MORE PEANUTS
YOU GO HIGHER THAN ANY MOUNTAIN AND GO FASTER THAN ANY CAR
I HAD A GAME BOY IN MY BACKPACK
IT WAS WORTH THE WHOLE TRIP JUST TO EAT A BANANA SPLIT WITH GRANDPA
EVENTUALLY THE FLIGHT ATTENDANT SEEMED TO GET A LITTLE ANNOYED THAT I HAD TO GO TO THE BATHROOM SO MUCH BUT IT WAS
BUT IT WASN'T PEANUTS IT WAS SOMETHING REALLY COOL
I COLORED THE DRAGON PICTURES ALL GREEN SO IT DIDN'T TAKE ME VERY LONG
OH SHE DIDN'T LIKE BEING CALLED PEANUT LADY
AND THAT IF
THE FIRST TIME I EVER TOOK AN AIRPLANE RIDE BY MYSELF IT WAS FUN AND SCARY
BY YOURSELF ON AN AIRPLANE IS THAT THE FLIGHT ATTENDANTS ARE VERY NICE TO YOU
THAT'S WHEN I MISSED MY PARENTS THE MOST BUT ONCE THE PLANE WAS IN THE AIR I WAS PRETTY GOOD
IT WASN'T REALLY HARD ONCE YOU PRACTICED
I TRIED TO PUSH THE BUTTON THAT LIGHTS UP OVER THE H OVER MY HEAD SO THE FLIGHT ATTENDANT WOULD COME
I TOLD HER THAT I WANTED A BANANA SPLIT INSTEAD BUT SHE SAID THEY DON'T HAVE BANANA SPLITS ON THE PLANE
I ALSO BROUGHT MY DECK OF CARDS IN CASE THE PILOT WAS BORED AND WANTED TO PLAY GO FISH
HE SAID HE THOUGHT
MY GAME BOY
I TRIED TO WATCH THE MOVIE BUT I HAD ALREADY SEEN THE ONE SO IT WAS BORING
BE THEN I COULD BE A PILOT TOO SINCE I'M MUCH BETTER AT PUSHING BUTTONS THAN YOU ARE
IMAGINE HOW HARD IT WOULD BE TO WORK WITH MILLIONS OF BUTTONS AND GET AND EAT PEANUTS
THE PILOTS TOLD ME THAT
BUT IT WAS HER FAULT
I THOUGHT AWESOME
BUT SHE DID GET ME
SHE WOULD GET ME A BANANA SPLIT I WOULDN'T HAVE TO GO THE BATHROOM SO MUCH
I WAS FLYING THERE TO SEE MY GRANDFATHER AND WE WERE GOING FI TO GO FISHING
I SAID SOMEDAY I'M GOING TO BE A PILOT AND I'LL ONLY SERVE BANANA SPLITS ON THE PLANE
JENNIFER TOOK
I WOULD MAKE A GREAT PILOT SOMEDAY IF I WANTED TO BE
SHE TOLD ME TO CALL HER JENNIFER INSTEAD
SHE SAID SHE HAD TO

YOU JUST NEED A LITTLE HELP THAT'S ALL SAID MAMA LET'S PLANT GRAN'S TULIPS WHILE I THINK ABOUT IT AND LATER I'LL TALK TO YOUR PAPA HE MAY HAVE SOME IDEAS

BEEN THERE HAVEN'T BEEN H ENOUGH PEOPLE COMING TO SEE YOU IN THE FIRST PLACE I THINK WHAT THE ZOO NEEDS IS A GREAT IS A
INDUSTRY
YEAH STRANGE ALMOST ALMOST A MAGIC EFFECT ON HUMANS BEING WHICH MAKES US WANT TO HUG AND SQUEEZE THINGS FRED FRED WAS NOT ALLOWED TO ACTUALLY HUG THE PANDA BEARS
WHY DID A PA OH THE PANDA
THE OTHER REASON WAS THAT YO ANYONE WHO GETS WITHIN THREE FEET OF A PANDA ACTUALLY FALLS IN LOVE WITH THEM IT'S ALL OF NATURE IT'S A LAW OF NATURE A
I KNOW I SHOULD BE TELLING YOU THIS I SHOULDN'T BE TELLING YOU THIS BUT WE MIGHT HAVE TO SELL YOU TO ANOTHER FAMILY IN THE BIG ZOO IN SAN SAN ANGE SA WAIT IN SAN

WAIT SAID WOULDN'T WOULD BE BEST TO ASK THE OWL THEN CLOSED HIS EYE SO MAGGIE FLEW TO THE OWL AND ASKED F A FOR ADVICE OH WISE OWL I HAVE A QUESTION THAT I FEAR YOU CAN ANSWER SHE SAID HOW TO
MANY PEOPLE KNOW THAT PANDAS EAT BAMBOO A LOT OF IT A LOT OF BAMBOO CAN GET QUITE HEAVY SO BE SO BECAUSE OF THE PANDAS FREDDY BECAME VERY STRONG AND WAS IN TERRIFIC SHAPE BUT PHYSICALLY FITNESS WAS NOT THE ONLY REASON THAT FREDDY LOVED THE PANDAS
SHE WAS TALKING TO HER BEST FRIEND MAGGIE THE MAGPIE MAGPIE ABOUT GOING TO THE MOON YES SAID ONE YES SAID THE BIG ONE IN THE SKY THAT THAT IT'S MOST LIKE NOT MADE OF CHEESE IT'S MOST LIKELY NOT MADE OF CHEESE AND MOST CERTAINLY NOT MADE OF BAMBOO
AS FOR YIN YIN HE WAS VERY PROUD OF HER AN TO BE RENAMED FOR A FAMOUS EXPLORER AND SHE AND MAGGIE NEVER STOPPED TRYING TO GET TO THE MOON
OBSTACLE IT RUNS OUT WAS GETTING
INTO A BALL AND ROLL TWO DAYS AGO IF I'VE BECOMING VERY GOOD AT IT I DON'T THINK I WILL IT WOULD MAKE A LONG TIME TO ROLL THERE SAID YIN YIN
SHE COULD BE VERY PERSUASIVE LITTLE BIRD AND WHEN SHE WANTED

I THINK WE'LL NEED MORE MAGPIES SAID MAGGIE YES BUT HOW MANY MORE YIN YIN SAID I'M NOT SURE EXACTLY REPLIED MAGGIE THE FATHER WA
DECIDEDLY AROUND ROLL ROUNDABOUT WAY TO GO YOU MUST GO GO IT T WAIT T'WOULDN'T BE BE BEST TO FLY WOULDN'T IT BE BEST TO FLY NONSENSE SAID MOTHER I'M SO MAD I'M GOING TO LOOK AFTER THAT LADY OVER THERE AND MAKE

BUT LATER FRED WALKED INTO THE PANDA PANDA'S HOME UNDER UNDER HIS NEW YE YELLOW UMBRELLA HE COULD COULD THINK TO SAY NONSENSE WAIT HE COULDN'T
ADVERTISING COMPANION FRED WAS STARTING TO FEEL THE UNCOMFORTABLE URGE TO HUG A PANDA BEAR TO HUG THE PANDA BEAR SO BEFORE HE RAN OFF TO HUG THE PALM TREE QUICKLY HE SAID IT COSTS SO MUCH TO FEED PANDA BEARS I I WOULD HATE IF YOU HAD TO LEAVE US AFTER ALL IT'S THE ONLY HOME YOU KNOW BESIDES IF YOU'RE LEAVING I GET I'LL GET TERRIBLY OUT OF SHAPE NOW IF YOU EXCUSE ME I NEED TO SQUEEZE SOME MORE BEFORE I SCREAM

YES BUT WHAT DOES THAT HAVE TO DO WITH THE PANDA'S NAME SAID THE ZOO MANAGER WELL IT SEEMS TO ME SIR THAT YIN YIN WANTED TO BE A GREAT EXPLORER INSTEAD BECAME A BUSINESS WOMAN
IT'S JUST THAT WE WE HAVEN'T BEEN ENOUGH PEOPLE C WE HAVEN'T
FURTHER DISTANCE PANDAS HAVE A STRANGE HAVE A HAVE A
ANGELES IF WE DON'T GET MORE MONEY THAT IS NOT IT'S NOT YEAH IF YOU DON'T GET MORE IT'S NOT THAT YOU'RE YOU REALLY AREN'T SELLING ENOUGH STUFFED PANDA BEARS

A WEEK LATER MAGGIE MANAGED TO ROUND UP TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND SEVENTY EIGHT MAGPIE
THE FATHER WATCHING THIS ALL THROUGH ONE EYE FOR HE WAS ALWAYS HAD THE LEAST ONE EYE ASLEEP AT ALL TIMES S SAID
OH WELL THAT MAKES SENSE THEN SAID THE MANAGER DID YOU KNOW THAT SINCE THE LITTLE PANDA BUILT THE BAMBOO ROCKET SHIP THOSE MAGPIE'S STARTED FLUTTERING ABOUT THE ZOO'S

IT'S SIS IT'S SIMPLE
BUT YIN YIN THE YOUNGER PANDA BEAR WAS NOT LISTENING TO FRED
IT IS INTEREST INTERESTING TO POINT OUT AT THIS TIME THAT MORE STUFFED PANDA BEARS ARE SOLD AT ZOO GIFT SHOPS THEN ALL OF THE OTHER STUFF ANIMALS COMBINED
EXPERIENCE WE NEED THOSE PANDAS WILL BE WITH US FOR A LONG TIME FRED THOUGHT ABOUT IT AND SAID YOU KNOW I THINK WE SHOULD RENAME YIN YIN COL

DISCUSSING ABOUT GOING TO THE MOON HER MOTHER AND FATHER KNEW THAT THEY WERE TALKING ABOUT TALKING THEY WERE TALKING ABOUT SINCE THEY HAD SINCE THEY H SINCE THEY HADN'T THOUGHT OF OR TALKED OF MUCH ELSE SINCE YIN YIN SAID I WANT TO GO THERE AND POINTED TO THE MOON
NOW WHILE ALL THIS WAS GOING ON DO YOU SUPPOSED FRED WAS DOING HE WAS FE HE WAS FEEDING THE PANDAS LIKE HE WAS SUPPOSED TO
VERY PROPER OR WISE FOR A YOUNG PANDA BEAR TO GO ROLLING OFF PLACES WHERE THERE WASN'T ANY BAMBOO
THERE WERE THOUSANDS OF TURTLES ALL OF DIFFERENT SPECIES ALL HAVING A GREAT TIME
I THINK THAT YOU WILL BE A GREAT CHAMPION FOR MANY YEARS SINCE TURTLES ONLY GET SLOWER WITH AGE
AFTER A FEW HOURS MOST OF THE TURTLES HAD GONE A FEW FEET ALL EXCEPT TWO
EXCEPT FOR MUD OF COURSE WITHOUT HIM WE DON'T HAVE A CHANCE
SAID SWISH
THEN PUT THE EARPLUGS IN HIS EARS AND COULDN'T HEAR MUD'S SINGING ANYMORE
THEY ALL FELT A LITTLE SAD BECAUSE THEY HADN'T HELD THE TURTLE CUP IN OVER SEVEN HUNDRED YEARS
THE CROWD STARTED YELLING SPEECH SPEECH
BUT HE DOESN'T WANT TO BE TREATED SPECIAL HE JUST WANTS TO BE NORMAL AND DOESN'T WANT EVERYBODY TO HATE HIM IF HE CAN'T BEAT MUD
THE TURTLE CUP WAS THE TROPHY THAT THE WINNER WOULD TAKE HOME TO THE VILLAGE
THIS WAS THE KIND OF THING THAT SWISH WOULD GET ALL THE TIME
IT WOULD TAKE SOME TURTLES FROM FAR AWAY VILLAGES TWO WHOLE WEEKS JUST TO GET THERE
FOR THE FIRST TIME IN SIX HUNDRED YEARS I WOULD LIKE TO PRESENT THE TURTLE CUP TO BLUE POND THE CROWD WENT WILD AGAIN
BUT SWISH WOULDN'T LET MUD SCARE HIM YOU'RE JUST TRYING TO MAKE ME QUIT I'M NOT GOING TO FALL TO YOUR TRICKS
HE WAS THE BIGGEST MOST RESPECTED AND ALSO ONE OF THE TRICKIEST TURTLES THERE WAS
TURTLES COULD CATCH UP WITH FRIENDS THEY HAD NOT SEEN SINCE LAST FESTIVAL
THE SLOWEST TURTLE
WHO IS THIS YOUNG PUNK HE THOUGHT TO HIMSELF
BY NOW ALL THE TURTLES WERE JUST WERE USUALLY WAY AHEAD OF MUD BUT THIS TIME SWISH HAD WAS JUST AS SLOW
THERE WERE ABOUT THREE HUNDRED TURTLES RACING THERE WERE ALL THE SLOWEST OF THE SLOW THE TURTLES ALL STRETCHED
WE ALL WANT YOU TO LOOK GOOD WHEN YOU BRING HOME THE CUP
BUT THEN RIGHT AT THE END RIGHT BEFORE THE SUNSET SWISH STARTED TO PULL AHEAD OF MUD
WHEN THE TIME OF THE FESTIVAL DREW NEAR ALL THE TURTLES IN THE LAND STARTED TOWARD GREAT POND
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN SHE SAID MUD FROM SLUDGE POND HAS BEEN DISQUALIFIED FOR SLEEPING DURING THE RACE
THIS WAS THE MOST FAMOUS TURTLE THERE WAS HE WAS THE SLOWEST TURTLE OF ALL TIME
SO ONE DAY HE TOLD HIS PARENTS I DON'T WANT TO RACE
SHE ANNOUNCED WELL MUD IT LOOKS LIKE YOU'RE YOU'VE DONE IT SLUDGE POND WINS THE TURTLE CUP AGAIN
RULE NUMBER TWO TURTLES ALL TURTLES MUST RUN AS FAST AS THEY CAN AND THE TURTLE THAT IS CLOSEST TO THE STARTING LINE WINS
TURTLES ARRIVED THERE WAS A SEVEN DAY FESTIVAL CALLED THE SHELL DWELLERS FESTIVAL WHERE THERE WAS LOTS OF EATING AND LAUGHING
SWISH'S MOM SMILED AND SAID I KNOW THAT YOU CAN WIN SWISH BUT IT'S AN HONOR JUST TO GET TO THE RACE SAID SWISH'S MOM
BUT THOUGH HE BECAME THE GREATEST AND BIGGEST TURTLE OF ALL TIME
SWISH STARTED YAWNING HE WAS TIRED FROM RACING AND THOUGHT THAT IF
THIS TURTLE WAS NAMED SWISH WHEN SWISH WAS BORN EVERYONE THOUGHT HE WAS A LITTLE SLOW
THEY WERE BOTH MOVING OF COURSE BUT THEY WERE SO SLOW THAT IT WAS HARD TO TELL
THEN HE HEARD THE MAYOR SAID RUNNER'S PLEASE TAKE YOUR POSITIONS
SWISH MADE A LOUD GULPING SOUND JUST DO YOUR BEST SAID HIS MOM
THE CROWD THOUGHT HE MUST HAVE REALIZED THAT HIS SINGING TRICK WASN'T WORKING BUT THEN
EVERYONE TREATED SWISH DIFFERENTLY
SWISHES FATHER SAID SON I HAVE SOMETHING TO TELL YOU AS YOU KNOW YOUR GREAT GREAT GRAND TURTLE RACED MUD ONCE
MUD STILL DIDN'T ANSWER IN FACT MUD WAS SOUND ASLEEP MUD HAD ACTUALLY SUNG HIMSELF TO SLEEP
WE NEVER THOUGHT OF THAT THEY ALL SAID
SWISH WAS HAPPY TOO BUT DEEP DOWN I INSIDE HE KNEW HE WAS JUST AS SLOW AS MUD
SURE THEY'RE NICE TO ME NOW BECAUSE THEY THINK I CAN WIN THE RACE BUT IF I LOSE THEY'LL BE DISAPPOINTED AND MAD AT ME
WHEN ALL THE
IT WAS BECAUSE OF SWISH THAT BLUE POND BECAME THE MOST RESPECTED POND IN THE LAND
HE SAID TURTLES NEVER CHEAT AND I'M A TURTLE WITH HONOR
HIS NAME WAS MUD AND HE WAS THE GREATEST CHAMPION IN THE HISTORY OF SHELL DWELLER'S FESTIVAL HE WAS UNBEATABLE
THEN HE SNAPPED OUT OF IT AND REMEMBERED HIS FATHER HAD WARNED HIM OF HIS OF THIS TRICK
THE WINNER OF THE GREAT TURTLE RACE WAS SO IMPORTANT THAT HE OR SHE DIDN'T HAVE TO MOVE FOR FOUR YEARS UNTIL THE NEXT FESTIVAL
SWISH WAS SAD THAT HE LOST BUT ALL THE TURTLES FROM BLUE POND W CHEERED FOR SWISH
MUD SAID TO SWISH THERE'S NO WAY THAT A TURTLE AS YOUNG AS YOU CAN BE SO SLOW EVEN I WAS FASTER THAN YOUR THAN YOU WHEN YOU I WAS YOUR AGE
A FAT TURTLE IN THE SLOW TURTLE A FAT TURTLE IS A SLOW TURTLE
IT LOOKED LIKE MUD IS STILL THE GREATEST TURTLE OF THEM ALL AND WHEN THE SUN WENT DOWN MUD WAS THE CLOSEST TURTLE TO THE STARTING LINE
AFTER SEVEN DAYS OF PLAYING AND DANCING AND BUG EATING FINALLY THE DAY OF THE RACE CAME
FINALLY AFTER THE LONG JOURNEY ALL THE TURTLES ARRIVED AT GREAT F POND
THE CROWD WENT WILD MS TORT WENT UP TO SWISH AND GAVE HIM THE TURTLE CUP
THEY LOOKED AT THE HORIZON AND SAW THE SUN WAS STARTING THE RISE JUST THEN THE MAYOR SAID READY SET SLOW AND OFF THEY WENT
THE MAYOR DOCTOR SOFTSHELL SAID THIS IS RIDICULOUS SWISH HAS TO RACE HE'S THE SLOWEST TURTLE I'VE EVERY S EVERY SEEN
SINCE TURTLE NEVER CHEAT THIS IS THE MOST IMPORTANT RULE TO BREAK THIS RULE WOULD MEAN AN END TO THE GREAT TURTLE RACE FOREVER
SWISH SAW A ROCK IN THE MIDDLE OF THE FIELD AND WONDERED HOW COME THEY DIDN'T MOVE THAT BIG ROCK OUT OF THE FIELD IT SEEMS TO BE IN EVERYONE'S WAY
HE ALWAYS MADE SURE THAT NO ONE TREATED HIM SPECIAL AND THAT HE TREATED EVERYBODY LIKE HE WANTED TO BE TREATED LIKE A TURTLE WITH HONOR
ONCE HIS MOTHER CALLED HIM IN FOR DINNER AND HE DIDN'T MAKE IT HOME UNTIL BREAKFAST THE NEXT MORNING AND HE WAS ONLY A FOOT AWAY
MS TORT P
SWISH AND MUD WERE BOTH BACK AT THE STARTING LINE IT LOOKED AS IF NEITHER OF THEM HAD MOVED AT ALL
LOOK THERE'S YOUR COUSIN PEEK A BOO FROM BIG PUDDLE VILLAGE SAID SWISH'S MOTHER YOU'LL GET UHM GET TO MEET ALL SORTS OF NEW TURTLES
SWISH READ THE RULES EVEN THOUGH HE KNEW THEM BY HEART
THAT'S NOT A ROCK SWEETIE SAID HIS MOM THAT'S MUD
MUD KEPT SINGING HIS LULLABY FOR A FEW HOURS BUT HE STOPPED RIGHT BEFORE SUNSET
SO WITH SWISH THEY THOUGHT MAYBE JUST MAYBE HE COULD BRING BACK THE TURTLE CUP TO THEIR LITTLE POND
IT WO IT HAD BEEN IN
MUD DIDN'T ANSWER THE MAYOR TAPPED MUD ON THE SHELL AND SAID HELLO HELLO MUD
YOU HAVE TO REMEMBER THAT EVEN THOUGH HE'S GIFTED AT BEING SLOW HE'S VERY VERY YOUNG SAID SWISH'S FATHER
HE GAVE MUD SUCH A CLOSE RACE
ALL THE EXTRA ATTENTION MADE SWISH VERY UNCOMFORTABLE HE THOUGHT
THERE WERE MANY LEGENDS ABOUT HIM IT WAS THE IT WAS RUMORED HE WAS SO SLOW HIS HEART WOULD ONLY BEAT ONCE A DAY
SWISH TOOK THE CUP THAT DAY FOR THE FIRST TIME HE WOULD TAKE IT MANY MORE TIMES AFTER THAT
SWISH WAS SUDDENLY VERY EXCITED HE TOLD HIS MOM YOU KNOW WHAT I'M GOING TO WIN THIS RACE
IT WOULD BE THAT IT WOULD BE NICE TO JUST LISTEN TO MUD'S SWEET VOICE AND FALL ASLEEP
EVERYTHING ABOUT THE FESTIVAL WAS FUN BUT THE MAIN EVENT WAS THE GREAT TURTLE RACE
EVERY FOUR YEARS TURTLES
HE HADN'T
MUD KNEW THAT THIS WOULD BE HIS CLOSEST RACE EVER AND HE WAS ACTUALLY GETTING A LITTLE BIT SCARED
DIRTY TRICKS THEN HE WHISPERED IN SWISH'S EAR ALL THE TRICKS THAT HIS GREAT GREAT GRAND TURTLE TAUGHT HIM
MS SNAPPER WOULD SAY HI SWISHY DO YOU WANT SOME YUMMY PIE TO FILL YOU UP AND SLOW YOU DOWN FOR THE BIG RACE
OH NO SHOUTED THE FANS MUD'S WINNING
AND THOUGHT REALLY SLOW THOUGHTS AS THEY DID THE SKY TURNED BA TURNED FROM BLACK TO DARK BLUE
SWISH HAD TO BE CARRIED ON HIS FATHER'S BACK SINCE IT WOULD HAVE TAKEN HIM MONTHS TO GET TO THE GREAT POND BY HIMSELF
THIS MEANS THAT WE HAVE A NEW CHAMPION THE REAL WINNER IS SWISH SOFTBELLY OF BLUE POND
RULE NUMBER THREE NO TURTLE MAY PRETEND TO BE GOING FAST BUT GOING GO SLOW INSTEAD ALL TURTLE MUST GO AS FAST AS THEY CAN AT ALL TIMES
ALL THE TURTLES IN BLUE POND HELD A MEETING TO DISCUSS THE PROBLEM
THIS TIME IT WAS A BIT CLOSER THAN YOU WOULD HAVE LIKED IT
BUT HE GOT A LI A LITTLE OLDER AND TUR THE TURTLES BEGAN TO REALIZE THAT SWISH WAS REALLY REALLY REALLY SLOW
MUCH GREATER OR BIGGER THAN MUD
POSTED THE T RULES OF THE RACE ON THE TREE FOR EVERYONE TO SEE
AFTER SIX HOURS MUD AND S SWISH WERE STILL TIED AND HAD ONLY MOVED A FEW INCHES
THE SLOWEST TURTLES FROM EACH POND WERE CARRIED TO THE STARTING LINE BY MEMBERS OF THEIR VILLAGE
HE WASN'T AS SLOW AS YOU BUT HE DID TEACH ABOUT MUD'S
FOR EXAMPLE MISTER PEEKS THE LOCAL SHELL CLEANER WOULD SAY HEY THERE SWISH YOU WANT A FREE SHELL WAXING TODAY
SLUDGE POND FOR OVER FIFTY YEARS BECAUSE NO ONE COULD EVER BEAT THEIR TURTLE
THE TOWN AGREED TO TREAT SWISH LIKE A NORMAL PERSON AND AFTER A WHILE SWISH DECIDED THAT HE WOULD BE PROUD TO TO RACE FOR HIS VILLAGE
THEY READ RULE NUMBER ONE THE GREAT RACE BEGINS AT SUNRISE AND ENDS AT SUNSET
THE MAYOR OF PONDLAND WENT TO PRESENT THE TURTLE CUP TO SLUDGE POND AGAIN
I NEVER PROMISED THAT I WOULD WIN THE RACE I CAN'T BEAT MUD ANYWAY I HEARD ONCE IT TOOK HIM THREE DAYS JUST TO YAWN
THEN MUD TRIED ANOTHER TRICK HE STARTED SINGING A SOFT BEAUTIFUL LULLABY
WHEN MUD WAS IN HIS PRIME THERE WAS A NEW TURTLE BORN IN BLUE POND
HE WOULD NEVER LOSE THE TURTLE CUP FOR THE REST OF HIS LONG LIFE
I KNOW IT AND ALL THESE TURTLES WILL KNOW THAT BLUE POND RULES I'M NOT AFRAID OF STUPID MUD
HE REACHED IN HIS SHELL AND AND PULLED OUT A COUPLE OF EARPLUGS
BLUE POND WAS A NICE VILLAGE LOCATED ABOUT THREE DAYS CRAWL FROM GREAT POND
THE LESS A TURTLE MOVES THE BIGGER THEY GET AND THE LONGER THEY LIVE SO YOU CAN SEE WINNING THE GREAT THE GREAT RACE IS A GREAT HONOR
WHAT WOULD YOU LIKE TO SAY TO ALL THE TURTLES AT THE FESTIVAL
FROM ALL OVER THE LAND WOULD CRAWL TO GREAT POND
THEY WERE VERY PROUD
MISTER PEEKS WOULD NEVER DO ANYTHING FOR FREE BUT HE WAS GOING TO GIVE SWISH A FREE SHELL WAXING
YOU'RE CHEATING YOU'RE GOING TO RUIN THE GREAT RACE FOREVER
HE HADN'T HAD TO MOVE FOR OVER FIFTY YEARS
THE MAYOR OF GREAT POND
MS SNAPPER WAS NEVER NICE TO ANYONE BUT SHE WAS NICE TO S SWISH
ALL THE TURTLES WERE VERY VERY SLOW SO IT TOOK T TOOK SOME TIME BEFORE ANYONE FIGURED OUT WHICH TURTLES WAS THE SLOWEST
THIS WAS SWISH'S FIRST EVER SHELL DWELLERS FESTIVAL AND HE THOUGHT IT WAS THE MOST WONDERFUL THING HE HAD EVER SEEN
SHE SAID SWISH YOU WERE THE YOUNGEST WINNER OF THE GREAT TURTLE RACE THAT WAS THE MOST EXCITING FINISH WE'VE EVER HAD
RULE NUMBER FOUR NO TURTLE MAY FALL ASLEEP SINCE IF YOU ARE ASLEEP YOU AREN'T RUNNING AS FAST AS YOU CAN
I'LL BET
OR EVEN HIS NEW FLUTE HE STARTED SHAKING THE FLUTE TO GET THE FLIES OFF THE
DANCING TO MUSIC THEY COULDN'T HEAR
IT WORKED DOCTOR JOHN WAS A TOWN HERO DOCTOR WONG WAS THE TOWN HERO
JOHN THOUGHT IT WAS AN OK IDEA
IN THE LITTLE TOWN OF FRANKSVILLE WHAT SHOULD THEY DO THEY COULDN'T KEEP JOHN IN JAIL AND THEY DIDN'T WANT TO KICK HIM OUT OF THE TOWN BECAUSE ALL
THEN SUDDENLY A FLY LANDED ON A LITTLE GIRL THEN THE FLY LANDED ON SOMEONE ELSE
TAKE THE GOOD WITH THE BAD BECAUSE AS BAD AS THE SOU AS
LOOK JOHN
DOCTOR WONG THOUGHT FOR FOR A SECOND THEN PRONOUNCED
THEIR PROBLEMS STARTED WHEN THEY RAN OUT OF WATER THANKFULLY SOMEONE WAS DIGGING A HOLE AND FOUND WATER
WHEN THE TOWNSFOLK HEARD THE NOISE THEY COULDN'T EVEN SWAT AT THE FLIES ANYMORE
IT WAS VERY UPSET HE WAS VERY UPSET AT FIRST THEN HE SAID OH WELL GOOD THING I BROUGHT MY OLD FLUTE AS BACK UP
HE WASN'T CALLED ROOSTER JOHN HE WASN'T CALLED ROOSTER JOHN YET THAT CAME LATER
OH NO SAID CHIEF SANDERS JUST WHEN THINGS WERE GOING GOOD IN FRANKSVILLE
OH NO SAID
OH THAT'S A NICE INSTRUMENT BUT IT'S JUST NOT THE FLUTE
FROM THEN ON JOHN WOULD WAKE UP AT SUNRISE LIKE A ROOSTER AND PLAY TO KEEP THE FLIES AWAY
THE LOCAL SCIENTIST DOC DOCTOR WONG CAME UP WITH AN IDEA HE THOUGHT THAT IF HE MADE A NEW MOUTHPIECE ESPECIALLY SHAPED FOR JOHN'S MOUTH THEN PERHAPS HE COULD PLAY THE FLUTE NORMALLY
HE PLAYED MANY MUSICAL INSTRUMENTS SUCH AS THE GUITAR THE TUBA THE PIANO AND THE CLARINET HOWEVER FOR SOME REASONS THE WAY HIS MOUTH WAS SHAPED MADE HIS FLUTE SOUND AWFUL
THE FLIES AWAY
CL CLEANER AND NO ONE HAD ANY CAVITIES
BUT JUST THEN A MA A MAN MOVED IN TOWN WHO PLAYED THE FLUTE SO BADLY THAT PEOPLE WOULD RUN AWAY SCREAMING
AND ACCIDENTALLY SMASHED IT INTO PIECES
THE PEOPLE IN THE TOWN DECIDED TO HAVE A GREAT BIG PARADE IN FRANKSVILLE TO CELEBRATE THE FACT
THE BAD FLUTE PLAYER WAS ROOSTER JOHN
WELL I'M SURE YOU GUESSED THAT DIDN'T WORK NO ONE COULD HEAR ANYTHING PEOPLE WERE GETTING INTO CAR ACCIDENTS AND
BAD AS THE FLUTE SOUNDED IT WAS A LOT BETTER THAN THOUSANDS OF FLIES CRAWLING ON THEM
I'VE HEARD YOU PLAY THE CLARINET YOU'RE QUITE GOOD WHY DON'T YOU PLAY THAT INSTEAD CH SAID CHIEF SANDERS
WINDOWS WERE BREAKING AND ALL THE COWS IN THE TOWN STARTED TO MAKE SOUR MILK
IT'S THE FLUTE SOUND THE FLIES HATE JOHN'S FLUTE PLAYING AS MUCH AS WE DO JOHN THE DENTIST DRIVES AWAY
BESIDES EVERYBODY LOVED JOHN SINCE HE HAD BECOME THE TOWN DENTIST EVERYBODY'S TEETH SO WERE MUCH WHITER AND
THEN THAT THE PEOPLE OF FRANKSVILLE VILLE REALIZED THAT THEY WOULD HAVE TO TAKE A GOOD
THEY HAD TO COVER THEIR EARS FROM THE HORRIBLE SOUND THE FLIES WOULD LAND ALL OVER THE PEOPLE AND THEY COULDN'T SWAT THEM OFF IT WAS GROSS THEN SUDDENLY THE FLIES FLEW AWAY FAST AS THEY COULD
F FRANKSVILLE IS WAS A TOWN THAT SEEMED TO HAVE ONE PROBLEM AFTER ANOTHER
JOHN DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TO DO SO HE KEPT PLAYING HIS FLUTE THE FLIES WERE ANNOYING SO HE WOULDN'T SO HE WOULD SWAT AT THEM WITH HIS HANDS
AND EVERYBODY LOOKED REALLY SILLY AT DANCES
I EVEN WROTE A SONG CHIEF SANDERS IT'S CALLED COPS AND ROBBERS
AND GUESS WHAT
WE CAN'T LET YOU PLAY THE FLUTE ANYMORE JOHN SAID THE POLICE CHIEF SAID POLICE CHIEF S SANDERS THE NEIGHBORS ARE COMPLAINING THAT THE CATS AND DOGS ARE TRYING TO CHEW OFF THEIR EARS
SO THERE WAS A PROBLEM
EVERYONE CHEERED
THE FLUTE SOUNDED NORMAL AND IT TURNED OUT JOHN COULD PLAY QUITE WELL
BUT THERE WAS AN ECHO IN THE WELL THAT MADE THE FLUTE SOUND LOUDER
THEN SOME SOME LANDED ON A BUNCH OF PEOPLE PRETTY SOON THERE WERE TONS OF FLIES
CAUSE THEY ALL HAD SUCH NICE TEETH SO THEY DECIDED THAT JOHN COULD PLAY THE FLUTE AND EVERYBODY ELSE WOULD WEAR WOULD HAVE TO WEAR EARPLUGS
STILL IT'S NOT AS BAD AS MILLIONS OF F FLIES I SUPPOSE
THEY JUST COULDN'T LEAD A NORMAL LIFE
HE WAS AN EXCELLENT DENTIST
BUT SOON AFTER THEY STARTED TO GET FLEAS THEY GOT TONS AND TONS OF FLEAS FLIES AND
BUT THEY COULDN'T KEEP JOHN IN JAIL SINCE HE WASN'T WASN'T REALLY BREAKING ANY LAWS SO THERE WAS NOTHING THE POLICE COULD DO
MAYBE A POORLY PLAYED FLUTE DOESN'T SOUND THAT BAD BUT JUST TRY TO IMAGINE SOME SCRATCHING SOMEONE SCRATCHING ON A CHALKBOARD WITH A FORK
HE WAS
BEFORE I TELL YOU HOW ROOSTER JOHN GOT HIS NAME YOU SHOULD KNOW A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE TOWN OF FRANKSVILLE
NO NO PLEASE DON'T PLAY YOUR OLD FLUTE BIG BEGGED DOCTOR WONG BUT IT WAS TOO LATE JOHN HAD STARTED PLAYING
AS WE
IT WAS
THEY WERE UP ON THE MAIN FLOAT THE BIG BAND PLAYED AS THEY MARCHED DOWN THE S D UP AND DOWN MAIN STREET
ROOSTER JOHN
TONS OF FLIES WERE LANDING ON EVERYONE BEFORE THEY KNEW IT THE TOWN WAS FILLED WITH FLIES AGAIN
THEN THEY DECIDED TO LOWER HIM DOWN
BUT HIS REAL LOVE WAS MUSIC
THAT FOR ONCE THERE WAS NO WATER PROBLEM NO FLY PROBLEM AND NO FLUTE PROBLEM DOCTOR WONG AND JOHN WERE STAR WERE THE STARS OF THE PARADE
THEN THE FLIES STOPPED
AND THEN MULTIPLY THAT TIMES BY THAT TIMES A HUNDRED THAT'S HOW THE FLUTE SOUNDED WHEN THIS GUY PLAYED IT I'M SERIOUS
BUT I HAVE I HAVE TO PLAY I WAS BORN TO DO IT I DON'T KNOW WHY BUT I FEEL LIKE I HAVE TO OR ELSE BAD THINGS WILL HAPPEN
THE NEW TOWN DENTIST
THEN HE PLAYED THE SONG THE POLICE CHIEF HATED THE SOUND SO MUCH HE THREW JOHN IN JAIL
A WELL AND LET HIM PLAY DOWN WHERE NO ONE COULD HEAR HIM
SO IT DIDN'T TAKE VERY LONG
SO
TO GO TO THE BATHROOM SO MUCH BUT IT WAS
I GOT MY NEW HIGH SCORE
THE FLYING
LIGHTS
AND WANTED TO PLAY GO FISH
THAT IT WASN'T R
TO HELP OTHER PASSENGERS

I HAD SEVEN COLA'S AND FOUR GINGER ALE'S WHICH MADE ME
TO SEE MY GRANDFATHER
SHE TOLD ME TO

I GUESS IT WAS BECAUSE THE PLANE WAS SO LOUD AND I DIDN'T

THINK ABOUT THAT BUT I DI COULDN'T
AND RIDE BY MYSELF IN
A LITTLE ANNOYED THAT I HAD

I PLAYED ON MY GAME BOY UNTIL I

TO I WAS TO SHORT TO REACH THE BUTTON
THE SLOWEST TURTLE
YOU CAN SEE WINNING THE GREAT RACE IS A GREAT HONOR
AND AS THEY DID N DID THE SKY TURNED FROM BLACK TO DARK BLUE
MUD KNEW THAT THIS WOULD BE HIS CLOSEST RACE EVER AND HE WAS ACTUALLY GETTING A BIT SCARED OF SWISH KID OF THIS SWISH KID
YOU HAVE
THEY WERE VERY PROUD HE GAVE MUD SUCH A CLOSE RACE
RULE NUMBER FOUR NO TURTLE MAY FALL ASLEEP SINCE IF YOU ARE ASLEEP YOU AREN'T RUNNING AS FAST AS YOU CAN
SWISH'S MOM SMILED AND SAID I KNOW THAT YOU CAN WIN SWISH BUT WE'LL BE PROUD OF YOU EVEN IF YOU DON'T WIN
SWISH TOOK THE CUP THAT DAY FOR THE FIRST TIME
BLUE POND WAS LOCATED ABOUT THREE DAYS CRAWL FROM THE GREAT POND
THEN MUD TRIED ANOTHER TRICK
HE THOUGHT IT WAS THE MOST WONDERFUL THING HE HAD EVER SAW
IT WAS RUMORED
THEY LOOKED AT THE HORIZON AND SAW THE SUN WAS STARTING THE RISE JUST THEN THE MAYOR SAID READY SET SLOW AND OFF THEY WENT
AFTER SEVEN DAYS OF PLAYING AND DANCING AND BUG EATING FINALLY THE DAY OF THE RACE CAME
ALL THE ALL THE EXTRA ATTENTION MADE SWISH VERY UNCOMFORTABLE
MUD KEPT SINGING HIS LULLABY FOR A FEW HOURS BUT HE STOPPED RIGHT BEFORE SUNSET
ALL THE TURTLES IN BIG BLUE POND IN BLUE POND HELD A MEETING TO DISCUSS THE PROBLEM
TURTLES COULD CATCH UP WITH FRIENDS THEY HAD NOT SEEN SINCE THE LAST FESTIVAL
MS TORT WENT UP TO SWISH AND GAVE HIM THE TURTLE CUP
EVEN I WAS FASTER THAN YOU WHEN I WAS YOUR AGE YOU'RE CHEATING YOU'RE GOING TO RUIN THE GREAT RACE FOREVER
THIS TURTLE WAS NAMED SWISH
WHEN THE TIME OF THE FESTIVAL DREW NEAR ALL THE TURTLES IN THE LAND STARTED TOWARD GREAT POND
IMAGINE HE HADN'T HAD TO MOVE FOR FIFTY YEARS
AND AFTER A WHILE SWISH DECIDED THAT HE WOULD BE PROUD TO RACE FOR HIS VILLAGE
THE SLOWEST TURTLES FROM EACH POND WERE CARRIED TO THE STARTING LINE BY MEMBERS OF THEIR VILLAGES
THAT'S NOT A ROCK SWEETIE SAID HIS MOM THAT'S MUD
HE WOULD NEVER LOSE THE TURTLE CUP FOR THE REST OF HIS LONG LIFE
I SWISH WAS SUDDENLY VERY EXCITED
IT LOOKED AS IF NEITHER OF THEM HAD MOVED AT ALL
THEY READ RULE NUMBER ONE THE GREAT RACE BEGINS AT SUNRISE AND ENDS AT SUNSET
OH NO SHOUTED THE FANS MUD MUD'S WINNING IT LOOKS LIKE MUD IS STILL THE GREATEST TURTLE OF THEM ALL
IT WOULD T IT WOULD TAKE SOME TURTLES FROM FAR AWAY VILLAGES TWO WHOLE WEEKS JUST TO GET THERE
HIS NAME WAS MUD AND HE WAS THE GREATEST CHAMPION IN THE HISTORY OF SHELL DWELLERS FESTIVAL HE WAS UNBEATABLE
THE TURTLE CUP WAS IN SLUDGE POND FOR OVER FIFTY YEARS THAT'S BECAUSE NO ONE COULD EVER BEAT THE TURTLE FROM THERE
HE WAS TIRED FROM RACING BUT RACING AND THOUGHT THAT IT WOULD BE NI BE NICE J TO JUST LISTEN TO MUD'S SWEET VOICE AND FALL ASLEEP
EVERYONE TREATED SWISH DIFFERENTLY FOR EXAMPLE MISTER PEEKS THE LOCAL SHELL CLEANER WOULD SAY
TO REMEMBER THAT EVEN THOUGH HE'S GIFTED HE'S STILL VERY YOUNG SAID SWISH'S FATHER
THE MAYOR OF PONDLAND WENT TO PRESENT THE TURTLE CUP TO SLUDGE POND AGAIN
THEN HE HEARD THE MAYOR SAY RUNNER'S PLEASE TAKE YOUR POSITIONS
SWISH SAW A BIG ROCK IN THE MIDDLE OF THE BIG FESTIVAL AND WONDERED ABOUT IT
SO WITH SWISH THEY THOUGHT MAYBE JUST MAYBE HE COULD BRING BACK THE TURTLE CUP
MUD FROM SLUDGE POND HAS BEEN DISQUALIFIED FOR SLEEPING DURING THE RACE
BUT AFTER A FEW HOURS MOST OF THE TURTLES HAD GONE A FEW FEET EXCEPT TWO
THE MAYOR OF GREAT POND MRS TORT PASSED THE RULES OF THE RACE TO EVERYONE FOR TO SEE
UH I NEVER PROMISED THAT I WOULD WIN THE RACE I CAN'T BEAT MUD ANYWAY
BUT THEN RIGHT AT THE END RIGHT BEFORE THE SUNSET SWISH STARTED TO PULL AHEAD OF MUD
BUT WITHOUT HIM WE DON'T HAVE A CHANCE
THE WINNER OF THE GREAT TURTLES RACE WAS SO IMPORTANT THAT HE OR SHE DIDN'T HAVE TO MOVE FOR FOUR YEARS UNTIL THE NEXT FESTIVAL
I KNOW IT
I THINK THAT YOU'LL BE A GREAT CHAMPION FOR MANY YEARS SINCE TURTLES ONLY GET SLOWER WITH AGE
YOU'RE JUST TRYING TO MAKE ME QUIT I'M NOT GOING TO FALL FOR YOUR TRICKS HE SAID
BUT AS HE GOT A LITTLE OLDER THE TURTLES BEGAN TO REALIZE THAT SWISH WAS REALLY REALLY REALLY SLOW
FINALLY AFTER THE LONG JOURNEY ALL THE TURTLES ARRIVED AT TH AT GREAT POND
MUD DIDN'T ANSWER THE MAYOR TAPPED MUD ON THE SHELL AND SAID HELLO HELLO MUD
YOU KNOW MY GRANDFATHER RACED MUD ONCE HE WASN'T AS SLOW AS YOU BUT HE DID TEACH ME A THING OR TWO
MRS SNAPPER WAS NEVER NICE TO ANYONE BUT SHE WAS BEING NICE TO SWISH
THEY WERE ALL THE SLOWEST OF SLOW
SWISH'S FATHER SAID SON DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT
AFTER SIX HOURS MUD AND SWISH WERE STILL TIED AND HAD ONLY MOVED A FEW INCHES
RULE NUMBER THREE NO TURTLE MAY PRETEND TO BE GOING AS FAST AS THEY CAN BUT GO SLOW INSTEAD
EVERY FOUR YEARS TURTLE FROM ALL OVER THE LAND WOULD CRAWL TO GREAT TO GREAT POND
HE THOUGHT TO HIMSELF
HE WAS WAS SO SLOW HIS HEART WOULD ONLY BEAT ONCE A DAY
THE TURTLE CUP WAS A TROPHY THAT THE WINNER WOULD TAKE HOME TO THEIR VILLAGE
SWISH STARTED YAWNING
WHO IS THIS YOUNG PUNK
SWISH READ THE RULES EVEN THOUGH HE KNEW THEM BY HEART
SWISH WAS HAPPY T BUT BUT DEEP DOWN INSIDE HE KNEW HE WAS JUST AS SLOW AS MUD
MOSTLY S NICE TURLES LIVED IN BLUE POND BUT THEY ALL FELT A LITTLE SAD BECAUSE THEY HADN'T HELD THE TURTLE CUP IN OVER SEVEN HUNDRED YEARS
HE STARTED SINGING A SOFT BEAUTIFUL LULLABY
IT'S AN HONOR JUST TO RA TO GET TO RACE SAID SWISH'S MOM
HE WOULD TAKE IT MANY MORE TIMES AFTER THAT
ALL THE TURTLES WERE VERY VERY SLOW SO IT TOOK SOME TIME BEFORE ANYONE COULD FIGURE OUT WHICH TURTLES WERE THE SLOWEST
THERE WERE THOUSANDS OF TURTLES MANY DIFFERENT SPECIES ALL HAVING A GREAT TIME
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN SAID MS TORT
SURELY THEY ARE NICE TO ME NOW BECAUSE THEY THINK I CAN WIN THE RACE BUT IF I LOSE THEY'LL BE DISAPPOINTED AND MAD AT ME
THE CROWD THOUGHT HE MUST HAVE REALIZED THAT IT WASN'T WORKING
EVERYTHING ABOUT THE FESTIVAL WAS FUN BUT THE MAIN EVENT WAS THE GREAT TURTLE RACE
SWISH WAS SAD
THE MAYOR DOCTOR SOFTSHELL SAID THIS IS RIDICULOUS SWISH HAS TO RACE HE'S THE SLOWEST TURTLE I'VE EVERY SEEN EXCEPT FOR MUD OF COURSE
BUT SWISH WOULDN'T LET MUD SCARE HIM
WHEN SWISH WAS BORN EVERYONE THOUGHT HE WAS A LITTLE SLOW
SHE SAID SWISH YOU ARE THE YOUNGEST WINNER OF THE GREAT TURTLE RACE THAT WAS THE MOST EXCITING FINISH WE'VE EVER HAD
HE WAS THE BIGGEST MOST RESPECTED AND ONE OF THE TRICKIEST TURTLES IN HISTORY
WHAT WOULD YOU LIKE TO SAY TO ALL THE TURTLES AT THE FESTIVAL THE CROWD STARTED YELLING SPEECH SPEECH
SWISH HAD TO BE CARRIED ON HIS FATHER'S BACK SINCE IT WOULD HAVE TAKEN HIM MONTHS TO GET TO GREAT POND BY HIMSELF
HE PUT THE EARPLUGS IN
MR SNAPPER WOULD SAY HI SWISHY DO YOU WANT SOME YUMMY PIE TO FILL YOU UP AND SLOW YOU DOWN FOR THE BIG RACE A FAT TURTLE IS A SLOW TURTLE
HE ALWAYS MADE SURE THAT NO ONE TREATED HIM SPECIAL AND THAT HE TREATED EVERYBODY LIKE HE WANTED TO BE TREATED LIKE A TURTLE WITH HONOR
THERE WERE ABOUT THREE HUNDRED TURTLES RACING
SWISH MADE A LOUD GULP SOUND
BUT THOUGH HE BECAME THE GREATEST AND BIGGEST TURTLE OF ALL TIME MUCH GREATER OR BIGGER THAN MUD
THEY WERE BOTH MOVING OF COURSE OH OF COURSE BUT THEY WERE S SO SLOW THAT IT H WAS HARD TO TELL
HE TOLD HIS MOM YOU KNOW WHAT I'M GOING TO WIN THIS RACE I KNOW
RULE NUMBER TWO ALL TURTLES MUST RUN AS FAST AS THEY CAN AND THE TURTLE THAT IS CLOSEST TO THE STARTING LINE WINS
WHEN ALL THE TURTLES ARRIVED THERE WAS A SEVEN DAY FESTIVAL CALLED THE SHELL DWELLERS FESTIVAL WHERE THERE WAS LOTS OF EATING AND LAUGHING
AND WHEN THE SUN WENT DOWN MUD WAS THE CLOSEST TO THE STARTING LINE
SO ONE DAY HE TOLD HIS PARENTS I DON'T WANT TO RACE
MUD SAID TO SWISH THERE'S THERE'S NO WAY THAT A TURTLE AS YOUNG AS YOU CAN BE SO SLOW
WHEN MUD WAS IN HIS PRIME THERE WAS A NEW TURTLE BORN IN BLUE POND
HE WAS THE SLOWEST TURTLE OF ALL TIME
THIS TIME IT WAS A BIT CLOSER THAN YOU WOULD HAVE LIKED I'LL BET
THEN HE SNAPPED OUT OF IT AND REMEMBERED HIS FATHER TOLD HIM ABOUT THIS TRICK GA TRICK GAVE HIM EARPLUGS
HEY THERE SWISH DO YOU WANT A FREE SHELL WAXING TODAY WE ALL WANT YOU TO GO TO LOOK GOOD WHEN YOU BRING HOME THE CUP
WE NEVER THOUGHT OF THAT THEY AGREED THEN THE TOWN AGREED TO TREAT SWISH LIKE A NORMAL TURTLE
SHE ANNOUNCED WELL MUD IT LOOKS LIKE YOU'VE DONE YOU'VE DONE IT SLUDGE POND WINS THE TURTLE CUP AGAIN
HOW CAN HOW COME THEY DON'T MOVE THAT BIG ROCK OUT OF THE FIELD IT SEEMS TO BE IN EVERYONE'S WAY SAID SWISH
IT WAS BECAUSE OF SWISH THAT BLUE POND BECAME THE MOST RESPECTED POND IN THE LAND
SWISH AND MUD WERE BOTH BACK AT THE STARTING LINE
LOOK THERE'S YOUR COUSIN PEEK A BOO FROM BIG PUDDLE VILLAGE SAID SWISH'S MOTHER YOU'LL GET TO MEET ALL SORTS OF NEW TURTLES
THIS MEANS THAT WE HAVE A NEW CHAMPION THE REAL WINNER IS SWISH SOFTBELLY OF BLUE POND THE CROWD WENT WILD
I HEARD ONCE IT TOOK HIM THREE DAYS JUST TO YAWN
THE RULES WERE NAILED TO A TREE TO TO A TREE FOR ALL TO SEE
THE LESS A TURTLE MOVES THE BIGGER THEY GET AND THE LONGER THEY LIVE SO YOU CAN SEE
SINCE TURTLES NEVER CHEAT THIS IS THE MOST IMPORTANT RULE TO BREAK THIS RULE WOULD MEAN AN END TO THE GREAT TURTLE RACE FOREVER
BUT HE DOESN'T WANT TO BE TREATED SPECIAL HE JUST WANTS TO BE NORMAL AND HE DOESN'T WANT EVERYBODY TO HATE HIM IF HE CAN'T BEAT MUD
THAT HE HAD THAT HE LOST BUT ALL THE TURTLES FROM BLUE POND CHEERED FOR SWISH
ONCE HIS MOTHER CALLED HIM FOR DINNER AND HE DIDN'T MAKE IT HOME UNTIL BREAKFAST THE NEXT MORNING AND HE WAS ONLY A FOOT AWAY
TURTLES NEVER CHEAT AND I'M A TURTLE WITH HONOR
AND ALL THESE TURTLES WILL KNOW THAT BLUE POND RULES I'M NOT AFRAID OF STUPID MUD
FOR THE FIRST TIME IN SIX HUNDRED YEARS I WOULD LIKE TO PRESENT THE TURTLE CUP TO BLUE POND THE CROWD WENT WILD AGAIN
THERE WERE MANY LEGENDS ABOUT HIM
THIS WAS SWISH'S FIRST EVER SHELL DWELLERS FESTIVAL
MUD STILL DIDN'T ANSWER IN FACT MUD WAS SOUND ASLEEP MUD HAD ACTUALLY SUNG HIMSELF TO SLEEP
MISTER PEEKS WOULD NEVER DO ANYTHING FOR FREE BUT HE WAS GOING TO GIVE SWISH A FREE SHELL WAXING
HIS EARS AND COULDN'T HEAR MUD'S SINGING ANYMORE
THEN HE TOLD SWISH ABOUT ALL OF THE MUD'S DIRTY TRICKS SO THAT SWISH WOULD BE READY FOR THEM
THE TURTLES ALL STRETCHED AND THOUGHT REALLY SLOW THOUGHTS
BY NOW ALL THE TURTLES WERE WAY AHEAD OF MUD BUT THIS TIME SWISH WAS JUST AS SLOW
ALL TURTLE MUST GO AS FAST AS THEY CAN AT ALL TIMES
DEAR MOM AND DAD PARENTS
OH SURE IT'S EASY TO SAY THAT I SHOULD HAVE JUST PICKED THE CAT UP BUT SOMETIMES WE DON'T ALWAYS THINK ALL THAT GREAT UNDER PRESSURE
ALSO I WAS GOING TO SELL THE CAT FUR AND BUY MY SISTER JENNY BRACES FOR HER BIG STUPID FACE
SO IN CONCLUSION I'M GETTING HUNGRY AND I'M SORRY FOR SHAVING THE CAT
SO SHE JUST IGNORED ME SEE SHE'S NOT SO RESPONSIBLE AFTER ALL
YOU SHOULD BE PROUD OF ME FOR THINKING SO FAST ON MY TOES
LAST NIGHT I SAW THAT SHE DIDN'T BRUSH HER TEETH OH YEAH I FORGOT TO TELL YOU THAT
POOR KITTY THIS AND POOR KITTY THAT IT'S YOUR FAULT REALLY
PLUS OSCAR MY TURTLE TOLD ME TO SHAVE THE CAT
CATS AREN'T ALWAYS NICE JUST LIKE MY SISTER JENNY ISN'T ALWAYS NICE
I WAS AFRAID YOU WOULDN'T LET ME PRACTICE ON MY OWN HEAD CAN I PRACTICE BY SHAVING JENNY'S HEAD
I REALLY DIDN'T MEAN TO SHAVE THE CAT REALLY I SWEAR
SO I THOUGHT THAT IF I COULD SHAVE THE CAT A LOT OF OF BUN A BUNCH OF TIMES HER HAIR WOULD GROW BACK HARDER EACH TIME AND SOON SHE WOULD HAVE AN INVINCIBLE COAT OF CAT FUR ARMOR
INSTEAD THE CAT CAME INTO MY ROOM BECAUSE JENNY NEVER PLAYS WITH IT ENOUGH
I JUST DIDN'T WANT TO SEE THE CAT GETTING ALL HOT AND UNCOMFORTABLE AND STUFF
PLUS IF YOU WEREN'T ALWAYS CUDDLING WITH MY SISTER SO MUCH MAYBE SHE WOULD HAVE BEEN WITH HER CAT
SO IT WAS REALLY MY FATHER'S DAY GIFT TO HIM
YOU GUYS NEVER LIKED OSCAR AS MUCH AS THE CAT ANYWAY
I WOULD LIKE TO START BY SAYING THAT I THINK THAT YOU ARE VERY MEAN TO MAKE ME DO THIS BECAUSE IT WASN'T EVEN MY FAULT
THAT'S THE LAST TIME I EVER SHAVE THE CAT TO PROTECT ANY STUPID GERBILS
SHE MADE US SHAVE SOMETHING FOR SCIENCE ASK HER
PS IF YOU WOULD'VE BOUGHT HER A TURTLE I COULDN'T HAVE SHAVED IT
I DON'T HAVE TO GET GOOD GRADES TO KNOW THAT YOU SHOULD TEACH A CAT TO SHAVE ITSELF
I THINK THAT SHE SHOULD BRUSH HER TEETH TWICE TONIGHT THAT'S JUST MY OPINION THOUGH
DEAR MOM DON'T LET DAD KNOW THAT THE REAL REASON I SHAVED THE CAT WAS THAT HE'S ALWAYS SNEEZING AROUND IT
I KNEW OUR CAT WOULD GROW HER FUR BACK BUT SOME CATS DON'T HAVE HAIR
TURTLES DON'T DO ANYTHING EXCEPT POKE THEIR HEADS OUT AND NOT BE NOT CUDDLY
ACTUALLY THE TRUTH IS THAT I BY ACCIDENT TURNED ON THE NOSE HAIR CLIPPERS AND THE CAT WAS BEING CHASED BY THE TURTLE AND RAN RIGHT BY THE CLIPPERS AND SHAVED HERSELF
I SAW THE CAT WAS TRYING TO GET THE GERBILS AND YOU TOLD US WE COULDN'T HIT ANIMALS SO I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT ELSE TO DO
SHE'S SO GOOD AT SCHOOL AND YOU BOUGHT HER A CAT CAUSE SHE'S JUST SO RESPONSIBLE AND STUFF
I THINK IT REALLY LIKED ITS HAIRCUT
BUT SO WHAT IF IT'S WINTER
IT KEEPS HITTING ME ON THE SHELL AND TRYING TO ROLL ME OVER WHEN YOU LEAVE THE ROOM
SINCE YOU HAVE GROUNDED ME AND TOLD ME TO WRITE DOWN WHY I AM SORRY BEFORE I WAS ALLOWED OUT OF MY ROOM I AM MAD AT YOU
AND YOU KNOW WHAT THOSE STUPID GERBILS DIDN'T EVEN THANK ME THEY JUST RAN ON THAT STUPID WHEEL AND DID STUPID THINGS
ALTHOUGH YOU CAN SEE THAT IT'S REALLY JENNY'S FAULT FOR NOT BEING AS RESPONSIBLE AS YOU ALWAYS SAY AND NOT BRUSHING HER TEETH
PLUS I FORGOT TO TELL YOU THAT YOU SHOULD BE BLAMING MS CASPER MY SCIENCE TEACHER
IF I HAD A CAT I KNOW I WOULD TEACH IT NOT SHAVE ITSELF THAT'S FOR SURE
DEAR MOM AND DAD JENNY DIDN'T BRUSH HER TEETH LAST NIGHT
FINE OSCAR CAN'T REALLY TALK BUT IF HE COULD HE WOULD HAVE SAID PLEASE SHAVE THE CAT
DAD PLEASE DON'T READ THE NEXT PART
HOW COME JENNY GETS A CAT AND I GET A STUPID TURTLE ANYWAY
BUT THE REAL REASON I SHAVED THE CAT WAS TO MAKE A WIG FOR THOSE POOR HAIR LESS CATS THAT WE SAW ON TV ON THE ANIMAL CHANNEL
OK HERE'S WHAT HAPPENED AS I REMEMBER IT
I PROMISE THAT I'LL DO A BETTER JOB THEN I DID ON THE CAT CAUSE NOW I HAVE WHAT DAD CALLS LIFE EXPERIENCE NOT THAT I SHAVED THE CAT THOUGH
THEN SHE WOULD BE A SUPER CAT AND YOU COULD TAKE HER ON TV SHOWS AND GET LOTS OF MONEY SO THAT YOU CAN SEND JENNY TO COLLEGE EVEN IF SHE IS A DUMB LITTLE TATTLE TALE
YOU GUYS WILL PROBABLY SAY YOU GUYS WILL JUST PROBABLY SAY IT'S WINTER DANNY CATS DON'T OVERHEAT IN WINTER
THE CAT LIKED BEING SHAVED ANYWAY SO I DON'T SEE THE BIG DEAL
I COULDN'T BUY HIM ANYTHING NICE SINCE YOU TOOK AWAY MY ALLOWANCE FOR WHEN I SHAVED THE NEIGHBOR'S DOG
YOU WOULDN'T ALWAYS TAKE THE CAT'S SIDE IF YOU KNEW THE STUFF HE DID TO MY POOR TURTLE
I COULDN'T HELP IT ANYWAY IT WAS AN ACCIDENT AND I DIDN'T EVEN DO IT ON PURPOSE
I WAS AFRAID TO TELL YOU THE REAL REASON I SHAVED THE CAT WAS THAT I WANT TO BE A BARBER AND I NEEDED PRACTICE
SHE SAID THAT WHEN WE SHAVE HAIR IT GROWS BACK HARDER AND SOMETIMES EVEN DARKER
BESIDES THE REAL REASON I SHAVED THE CAT WAS TO KEEP IT NICE AND COOL
SINCERELY DANNY
I'LL BET YOU DIDN'T KNOW SOMETHING ELSE DID YOU KNOW THAT I WANTED TO BE A BARBER
I KNOW HOW MUCH YOU HATE HIM SNEEZING AND STUFF SO I THOUGHT IF I GOT RID OF HIS FUR HE WOULDN'T SNEEZE AND THAT YOU'D HAVE A BETTER MARRIAGE
CAN I GET A DOG PLEASE
THEY ARE ALL HAIRLESS CAT THEY ARE CALLED HAIR LESS CATS AND THEY NEED FUR IN THE WINTER SOMETIMES I THINK I SWEAR THAT'S THE REASON
SO I GRABBED DAD'S NOSE HAIR CLIPPERS AND SHAVED IT
I KEPT SAYING NO KITTY NO DON'T SHAVE YOURSELF BUT MY STUPID SISTER NEVER TAUGHT HER CAT HOW TO LISTEN
JUST CAUSE SHE'S A GOOD STUDENT DOESN'T MEAN SHE'S REALLY RESPONSIBLE
I MEAN IT'LL BE SUMMER SOON ENOUGH AND I JUST WANTED THE CAT TO GET USED TO THE IDEA BEFORE IT GETS GOT REALLY HOT
THE ONLY REASON IT HASN'T COME OUT FOR TWO WEEKS IS BECAUSE YOU GUYS KEEP MAKING SUCH A BIG DEAL ABOUT IT
NO ONE COULD BLAME FRED REALLY SINCE NO ONE REALLY WANTS TO BE EATEN
THE PANDA
WELL SIR WHEN COLUMBUS SET OUT ON HIS SHIP HE WAS REALLY TRYING TO FIND A QUICKER WAY TO GET AROUND EUROPE IN ORDER TO IMPROVE TRADE HE WANTED TO BE A BUSINESS MAN BUT INSTEAD BECAME A GREAT EXPLORER
SO MAGGIE FLEW TO THE OWL ASKED FOR HIS ADVICE
BUT HE WAS SUPPORTIVE OF HIS YOUNG DAUGHTER AND SHOWED SUPPORT BY TAKING A NAP
YES BUT WHAT DOES THAT HAVE TO DO WITH THE PANDAS MAN SAID THE ZOO KEEP MANAGER
NOW WHILE ALL THIS WAS GOING ON WHAT DO YOU SUPPOSE FRED WAS DOING WHY HE WAS FEEDING THE PANDAS LIKE HE WAS SUPPOSED TO
THE MAIN OBSTACLE IT TURNS OUT WAS GETTING THE ROCKET SHIP OFF THE GROUND
THIS CAN ALMOST CERTAINLY BE ACCOUNTED FOR BY THE STRANGE ALMOST MAGICAL EFFECT THAT THE PANDAS POSSESS
I THINK THAT THE ZOO NEEDS A GREAT ADVERTISING CAMPAIGN
SUCH NONSENSE GOING TO THE MOON SAID HER MOTHER POO POO
FOR FRED WHEN IT CAME TO THE PANDAS HE HAD A WARM SPOT IN HIS HEART
YIN YIN AND HER BEST FRIEND MAGGIE THE MAGPIE WHO LOOKED A LOT LIKE A PANDA WOULD LOOK WOULD LOOK IF PANDAS WERE BIRDS WERE DISCUSSING ABOUT GOING TO THE MOON
FRED FED THE PANDA BEARS THE TIGERS AND THE TURTLES
AS AT FUTHER DISTANCES PANDAS HAVE A STRANGE ALMOST MAGICAL EFFECT ON HUMAN BEINGS WHICH MAKES US WANT TO HUG AND SQUEEZE THINGS
THE OWL INSTANTLY REPLIED TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND AND SEVENTY SIX GIVE OR TAKE TWO
I'M SORRY TO SAY BUT MANY A BOY LITTLE BOY'S CHEEKS HAVE BEEN MADE RAW WHEN MOTHER POO POO PANDA WAS UPSET
BACK AT THE PANDA'S HOME THE MOTHER PANDA POO POO WAS VERY PROUD OF HER DAUGHTER AFTER ALL IF IT WEREN'T FOR YIN YIN THEY WOULD HAVE HAD TO MOVE FROM THEIR WONDERFUL HOME
LIKE IT OR NOT WE ARE SPOKESPEOPLE FOR THE PANDA STUFFED ANIMAL INDUSTRY WHICH YOUNG LADY HELPS PAY FOR THE BAMBOO THAT YOU EAT
THIS IS JUST THE TYPE OF EXPOSURE WE NEEDED THOSE PANDAS WILL BE WITH US FOR A LONG TIME
HMM HEAVIER THAN I THOUGHT I THINK WE'LL NEED MORE MAGPIES SAID MAGGIE
I KNOW I SHOULDN'T BE TELLING YOU THIS BUT WE MIGHT HAVE TO SELL YOU AND YOUR FAMILY TO THE BIG ZOO IN SAN SAN ANGELES IF WE DON'T GET MORE MONEY
WHY DID A PANDA WITH THE BEAUTIFUL GIRL NAME YIN YIN HAVE HER NAME CHANGED TO THE VERY UN BEAUTIFUL GIRL NAME COLUMBUS
BUT PHYSICAL FITNESS WAS NOT ONLY THE ONLY REASON THAT FRED LOVED THE PANDAS
BESIDES IF YOU LEAVE I'LL GET TERRIBLY OUT OF SHAPE NOW IF YOU EXCUSE ME I NEED TO SQUEEZE SOMETHING BEFORE I SCREAM
NONSENSE SAID THE MOTHER I'M SO MAD I'M GOING TO LOOK AT THE LADY OVER THERE AND MAKE HER WANT TO SQUEEZE HER SON CHEEKS SHE SAID SPITEFULLY
I SEE FRED ONE MORE THING SIR ABOUT THOSE MAGPIES FLYING ABOVE THE PANDAS DO YOU THINK THAT THE ZOO COULD PURCHASE ME A LARGE SIZED UMBRELLA
IT'S SIMPLE ECON ECONOMICS
IT'S TAKEN ME A COUPLE OF WEEKS TO FIGURE IT OUT BUT I THINK YIN YIN WANTS TO GO TO THE MOON AND THE MAGPIES WANT TO TAKE HER THERE SAID FRED
ONE TWO THREE TO THE MOON THEY SAID TOGETHER PULLING WITH ALL THEIR MIGHT
ONE MORNING FRED WAS FEEDING YIN YIN AND SAID OH YIN YIN I WISH THAT MORE PEOPLE WOULD COME AND VISIT THE ZOO
FRED WAS STARTING TO FEEL THE UNCONTROLLABLE URGE TO HUG THE PANDA SO BEFORE HE RAN OFF TO HUG THE PALM TREE HE QUICKLY SAID
I'M NOT SURE EXACTLY REPLIED MAGGIE
I DON'T THINK IT WILL TAKE THAT LONG TO ROLL THERE SAID YIN YIN
THERE WERE THREE PANDAS AND THEY WERE KNOWN AS THE PAN FAMILY
ENOUGH OF THIS NONSENSE SAID YIN YIN'S MOTHER POO POO WHAT SORT OF NONSENSE IS THIS FOR A YOUNG PANDA BEAR GOING TO THE MOON INDEED MOON INDEED
HE DIDN'T MIND HANDLING THE RAW MEAT HE HAD TO FEED TH TO THE TIGERS
AND LESS THAN A WEEK LATER YIN YIN AND MAGGIE HAD BUILT A ROCKET SHIP OUT OF BAMBOO
SO ALL THE OTHER PEOPLE IN THE ZOO WOULD KNOW THAT THE PANDAS HAD JUST BEEN FED WHEN THEY SAW FRED HUGGING THE RATHER UNCUDDLY PALM TREE OUTSIDE THE PANDAS HOME
AS FOR YIN YIN SHE WAS VERY PROUD TO BE RENAMED AFTER A FAMOUS EXPLORER AND SHE AND MAGGIE NEVER STOPPED TRYING TO GET TO THE MOON
FRED THOUGHT ABOUT IT AND SAID YOU KNOW I THINK WE SHOULD RENAME YIN YIN COLUMBUS
SOME PEOPLE DO LIKE TO BITE THEIR FINGER NAILS BUT FRED WASN'T A NAIL BITER SO BEING EATEN WAS DEFINITELY NOT SOMETHING HE LOOKED FORWARD TO
SO BECAUSE OF THE PANDAS FRED BECAME VERY STRONG AND WAS IN TERRIFIC SHAPE
OH WISE OWL I HAVE A QUESTION THAT I FEAR ONLY YOU CAN ANSWER SHE SAID
AFTER ALL IT'S ONLY HOME YOU KNOW IT'S THE ONLY HOME YOU KNOW
WELL IT SEEMS TO ME SIR THAT YIN YIN WANTED TO BE A GREAT EXPLORER INSTEAD OF A BUSINESS WOMAN
MANY PEOPLE KNOW THE THAT PANDAS EAT BAMBOO A LOT OF IT AND A LOT OF BAMBOO CAN GET QUITE HEAVY
BUT BEFORE HE FELL ASLEEP HE DID MANAGE TO SAY I BELIEVE ROLLING IS DECIDEDLY ROUND ABOUT WAY TO GO IF YOU MUST GO T'WOULD BE NICE TO BE IT T'WOULD BE BEST TO FLY
SO ONE DAY AFTER FRED HAD FED THE PANDAS AND WAS HUGGING THE PALM TREE THE ZOO MANAGER CAME UP TO HIM AND SAID WHAT IS GOING ON WITH YOUR PANDA FRED I'VE NEVER SEEN ANYTHING LIKE IT
YOUR JOB IS TO BE CUTE SO PEOPLE WANT TO RUN TO THE GIFT SHOP AND BUY PANDA BEAR DOLLS
BUT EVERYTHING WAS NOT ALL BAMBOO AND HUGS AT THE ZOO
MAGGIE FIGURED IF SHE AND THE THREE OF HER STRONGEST MAGPIE FRIENDS WERE TO EACH GRAB HOLD OF A CORNER OF THE ROCKET SHIP THEY COULD ALL FLY TO THE MOON SO THEY TRIED
ACTUALLY IT WAS EIGHTY FIVE POINT FIVE DEGREE SPOT ON HIS LEFT KIDNEY BUT THE POINT WAS THAT HE WAS VERY FOND OF FEEDING THE PANDAS
BUT I JUST LEARNED HOW TO MAKE MYSELF INTO A BALL AND ROLL TWO DAYS AGO AND I'VE BECOME VERY AND I'M BECOMING VERY GOOD AT IT
THE TURTLES WEREN'T SO BAD BUT AS FOR THE TIGERS HE WASN'T SO SURE
HER MOTHER AND FATHER KNEW WHAT THEY WERE TALKING ABOUT SINCE THEY HADN'T THOUGHT OR TALKED OF MUCH ELSE SINCE YIN YIN SAID I WANT TO GO THERE AND POINTED TO THE MOON
FRED WAS NOT ALLOWED TO ACTUALLY HUG THE PANDA BEARS SINCE THAT COULD BE DANGEROUS
A WEEK LATER MAGGIE MANAGED TO ROUND UP TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND SEVENTY EIGHT MAGPIE SHE COULD BE VERY PERSUASIVE LITTLE BIRD IF SHE WANTED
BUT LATER WHEN FRED WALKED INTO THE PANDA'S HOME UNDER A HIS NEW YELLOW UMBRELLA ALL SHE COULD THINK WAS TO SAY WAS NONSENSE
YIN YIN HAS WAS ALWAYS ONE TO TAKE GOOD ADVICE FROM HER FATHER
YES BUT HOW MANY MORE YIN YIN SAID
IT'S NOT THAT YOU AREN'T SELLING ENOUGH STUFFED PANDA BEARS IT'S JUST THAT YOU HAVEN'T BEEN THERE HAVEN'T BEEN ENOUGH PEOPLE COMING TO SEE YOU IN THE FIRST PLACE
FRED WAIT EACH AFTERNOON AT THREE O'CLOCK WHEN IT WAS TIME TO FEED THE TIGERS
IT WAS FRED'S IDEA SO LET'S BEGIN WITH FRED
YES THE BIG ONE IN THE SKY THAT IS MOST LIKELY NOT MADE OF CHEESE AND MOST CERTAINLY NOT MADE OF BAMBOO
THE OTHER REASON WAS THAT ANYONE WHO GETS WITHIN THREE FEET OF A PANDA AUTOMATICALLY FALLS IN LOVE WITH THEM IT'S A LAW OF NATURE
NO HOW MANY MAGPIE'S WOULD BE NEEDED TO FLY A FOUR HUNDRED POUND PANDA BEAR TO AND A ONE HUNDRED POUND BAMBOO ROCKET SHIP TO THE MOON SAID MAGGIE
BUT YIN YIN THE YOUNG PANDA WAS NOT LISTENING TO FRED SHE WAS TALKING TO HER BEST FRIEND MAGGIE THE MAGPIE ABOUT GOING TO THE MOON
AN INSTANT LATER A YOUNG BOY HEARD WAS HEARD SAYING OUCH MOM CUT THAT OUT
OH WELL THAT MAKES SENSE THEN SAID THE MANAGER DID YOU KNOW THAT SINCE THE LITTLE PANDA BUILT THAT BAMBOO ROCKET SHIP THOSE MAGPIE'S STARTED FLUTTERING ABOUT AND THE ZOO'S PROFITS HAVE GONE UP FOUR THOUSAND PERCENT
I SEE YOUR WINGS FLAPPING BUT WE DON'T SEEM TO BE GOING ANYWHERE SAID YIN YIN
THE FATHER WATCHING THIS ALL THROUGH ONE EYE FOR HE ALWAYS HAD AT LEAST ONE EYE UHM ONE EYE ASLEEP AT ALL TIMES SAID T'WOULD BE BEST TO ASK THE OWL THEN CLOSED HIS EYE
IT COSTS SO MUCH TO FEED YOU PANDA BEARS I WOULD HA I W I WOULD HATE IF YOU HAD TO LEAVE US
THERE WERE THEY WERE IN ORDER OF CUTENESS YIN YIN THE YOUNGER DAUGHTER POO POO THE MOTHER AND MOO MAN THE GENTLE AND ALWAYS SLEEPY FATHER
YIN YIN'S FATHER MOO MAN DIDN'T THINK IT WAS VERY PROPER OR WISE FOR A YOUNG PANDA BEAR TO GO ROLLING OFF TO PLACES WHERE THERE WASN'T ANY BAMBOO
HIS MAIN OBJECTION WAS BE TO BEING EATEN
IT TURNS OUT THAT THE OWL DIDN'T TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION THAT ONCE YOU GET OVER A THOUSAND MAGPIE TOGETHER THEY TEND TO FIGHT AND CAN'T AGREE ON A SINGLE THING
NONSENSE
IT'S INTERESTING TO POINT OUT AT THIS TIME THAT MORE STUFFED PANDA BEARS ARE SOLD AT ZOO GIFT SHOPS THAN ALL OF THE OTHER STUFFED ANIMALS COMBINED
BAMBOO IS VERY WORKABLE SUBSTANCE AND PANDAS TEND TO HANDLE BAMBOO A LOT SO THIS IN ITSELF WAS NOT THAT ASTONISHING AT LEAST TO YIN YINS PARENTS FRED SURE WAS IMPRESSED THOUGH
A WEEK LATER DESPITE MUCH FLAPPING THEY WERE STILL TRYING TO GET THE ROCKET IN THE AIR
THE ZOO KEEPER SAID GOOD HEAVENS TH THAT IS A GREAT IDEA NO WAIT A SECOND I DON'T UNDERSTAND
ROOSTER JOHN
HE WAS THE NEW TOWN DENTIST
THEY EVEN W WERE UP ON THE MAIN FLOAT
SO THEY DECIDED THAT JOHN COULD PLAY THE FLUTE AND EVERYBODY ELSE WOULD HAVE TO WEAR EARPLUGS
IT'S THE FLUTE SOUND THE FLIES HATE JOHN'S FLUTE PLAYING AND AS MUCH AS WE DO
HE WAS VERY UPSET AT FIRST THEN HE SAID OH WELL GOOD THING I BROUGHT MY OLD FLUTE AS A BACK UP
WINDOWS WERE BREAKING AND ALL THE COWS IN TOWN STARTED TO MAKE SOUR MILK
THEY GOT TONS AND TONS OF FLIES
THAT'S HOW THE FLUTE SOUNDED WHEN THE GUY PLAYED IT I'M SERIOUS
AND GUESS WHAT WHAT IT WORKED
BESIDES EVERYBODY LOVED JOHN
WE CAN'T LET YOU PLAY THE FLUTE ANYMORE JOHN SAID POLICE CHIEF SANDERS
AND EVERYBODY LOOKED REALLY SILLY AT DANCES DANCING TO MUSIC THEY COULDN'T HEAR
THANKFULLY SOMEONE WAS DIGGING A HOLE AND FOUND WATER
BUT BEFORE THEY KNEW IT THE TOWN WAS FILLED WITH FLIES AGAIN
FROM THEN ON JOHN WOULD WAKE UP AT SUNRISE JUST LIKE A ROOSTER TO PLAY TO PLAY TO KEEP THE FLIES AWAY
THEY HAD TO COVER THEIR EARS FROM THE HORRIBLE SOUND
HE THOUGHT THAT IF HE MADE A NEW MOUTHPIECE ESPECIALLY SHAPED FOR JOHN'S MOUTH THEN PERHAPS HE COULD PLAY THE FLUTE NORMALLY
MAYBE A POORLY MAYBE A POORLY PLAYED FLUTE DOESN'T SOUND ALL THAT BAD
BUT THEY COULDN'T KEEP JOHN IN JAIL SINCE HE REALLY SINCE HE WASN'T REALLY BREAKING ANY LAWS
HOWEVER FOR SOME REASON THE WAY HIS MOUTH WAS SHAPED THE M MADE HIS FLUTE SOUND AWFUL
FRANKSVILLE IS A TOWN THAT SEEMED TO HAVE ONE PROBLEM AFTER THE OTHER
THEN SUDDENLY A FLY LANDED ON THE LITTLE GIRL THEN THE FLY LANDED ON SOMEONE ELSE THEN SOME LANDED ON A BUNCH OF PEOPLE
THEN IT WAS THE THEN THE PEOPLE OF FRANKSVILLE REALIZED THAT THEY WOULD HAVE TO TAKE THE GOOD WITH THE BAD
HE PLAYED THE SONG THE POLICE CHIEF HATED THE SOUND SO MUCH THAT HE THREW JOHN IN JAIL
JOHN HAD STARTED PLAYING
HE THOUGHT THAT IF UHM
THE BAD THE BAD FLUTE PLAYER WAS ROOSTER JOHN
THE PEOPLE IN THE TOWN DECIDED TO HAVE A GREAT BIG PARADE IN FRANKSVILLE TO CELEBRATE THE FACT FOR ONCE THAT THERE WAS NO WATER PROBLEM NO FLY PROBLEM AND NO FLUTE PROBLEM
SO THERE WAS NO PROBLEM IN A LITTLE IN THE LITTLE TOWN OF FRANKSVILLE
BUT I HAVE TO PLAY I WAS BORN TO DO IT I DON'T KNOW WHY BUT I FEEL LIKE I HAVE TO OR ELSE BAD THINGS WILL HAPPEN
THE FLIES WERE ANNOYING SO HE WOULD SWAT AT THEM WITH HIS HAND OR EVEN HIS NEW FLUTE
AND THEY DECIDED TO LOWER HIM DOWN A WELL AND LET HIM PLAY THERE WHERE NO ONE DOWN THERE WHERE NO ONE C DOWN WHERE NO ONE COULD HEAR HIM
IT WAS GROSS THEN SUDDENLY THE FLIES FLEW AWAY FAST AS THEY COULD
THE FLIES STOPPED JUST A BIT AND THEN A MAN MOVED INTO TOWN WHO PLAYED A F WHO PLAYED THE FLUTE SO BADLY THAT PEOPLE WOULD RUN AWAY SCREAMING
HE PLAYED MANY MUSICAL INSTRUMENTS SUCH AS THE GUITAR THE TUBA THE PIANO AND THE CLARINET
BEFORE I TELL YOU ABOUT H HOW ROOSTER JOHN GOT HIS NAME YOU SHOULD KNOW A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE TOWN OF FRANKSVILLE
A BIG BAND PLAYED AS THEY MARCHED UP AND DOWN MAIN STREET EVERYONE CHEERED
HE WAS AN EXCELLENT DENTIST BUT HIS REAL LOVE WAS MUSIC
JOHN THE DENTIST IS DRIVING THE FLIES AWAY
SINCE I'M SURE YOU GUESSED THAT DIDN'T WORK
NO NO PLEASE DON'T PLAY YOUR OLD FLUTE BEGGED DOCTOR WONG BUT IT WAS TOO LATE
OH THAT'S A THAT'S A NICE INSTRUMENT BUT IT'S NOT THE FLUTE I EVEN WROTE YOU A SONG CHIEF SANDERS IT'S CALLED COPS AND ROBBERS
THE LOCAL DENTIST DOCTOR SCIENTIST DOCTOR WONG CAME UP WITH AN IDEA
DOCTOR WONG WAS THE TOWN HERO THE FLUTE SOUNDED NORMAL AND TURNED OUT JOHN COULD PLAY IT QUITE WELL
STILL THAT'S NOT THAT'S NOT AS BAD AS MILLION FLIES OF FLIES MILLIONS OF FLIES I SUPPOSE
SINCE HE HAD BECOME THE TOWN DENTIST EVERYONE'S TEETH WERE MUCH WHITER AND CLEANER NO ONE HAD ANY CAVITIES
JOHN DIDN'T KNOW WHAT WHAT JUST KEPT TO DO SO HE JUST KEPT ON PLAYING HIS FLUTE
THE NEIGHBORS ARE COMPLAINING AND THE CATS AND DOGS ARE TRYING TO CHEW OFF THEIR EARS
BUT SOON AFTER THEY
THEY R THEY COULDN'T THEY COULDN'T THEY JUST COULDN'T LEAD A NORMAL LIFE
OH NO SAID CHIEF SANDERS WHEN THINGS WERE JUST GOING GOOD FOR FRANKSVILLE
THE FLIES WOULD LAND ALL OVER THE PEOPLE AND THEY COULDN'T SWAT THEM OFF
BUT JUST TRY TO IMAGINE SOMEONE SCRATCHING A CHALKBOARD WITH A FORK AND THEN MULTIPLY THAT TIMES A HUNDRED
THERE WAS NOTHING THE POLICE COULD DO
THEIR PROBLEMS STARTED WHEN THEY RAN OUT OF WATER
PRETTY SOON TONS OF FLIES WERE LANDING ON EVERYONE
NO ONE COULD HEAR ANYTHING PEOPLE WERE GETTING INTO CAR ACCIDENTS
WHEN THE TOWNSFOLK HEARD THE NOISE THEY COULDN'T EVEN SWAT THE FLIES ANYMORE
DOCTOR WONG AND JOHN WERE THE STARS OF THE PARADE
HE WASN'T CALLED ROOSTER JOHN YET BUT THAT CAME LATER
DOCTOR WONG THOUGHT F THOUGHT FOR A SECOND AND THEN PRONOUNCED
WHAT SHOULD THEY DO THEY COULDN'T KEEP JOHN IN JAIL AND THEY DIDN'T WANT TO TO KICK HIM OUT OF TOWN BECAUSE THEY ALL HAD SUCH NICE T NICE TEETH
HE STARTED SHAKING THE FLUTE TO GET THE FLIES OFF AND ACCIDENTALLY S SMASHED IT INTO PIECES
LOOK JOHN I'VE HEARD YOU PLAY THE CLARINET YOU'RE QUITE GOOD WHY DON'T YOU PLAY THAT INSTEAD SAID CHIEF SANDERS
AFTER THAT S THEY STARTED TO GET FLIES
JOHN THOUGHT THAT IT WAS AN OK IDEA BUT THERE WAS AN ECHO IN THE WELL THAT MADE THE FLUTE SOUND LOUDER
THINKING WE MIGHT CRASH
THE FIRST TIME I EVER TOOK AN AIRPLANE BY MYSELF IT WAS FUN AND SCARY
BUT IT DID
THEN JENNIFER CAME UP TO ME AND SAID SHE HAD A SURPRISE I THOUGHT GREAT MORE PEANUTS
WHEN I GOT OFF THE AIRPLANE THERE WAS GRANDPA WAITING FOR ME HE SAID HOW WAS YOUR FLIGHT
I SAID IF YOU CAN'T GET PAST LEVEL ONE
SHE SAID THEY DON'T HAVE ANY BANANA BANANA SPLITS ON THE PLANE BUT SOMETIMES PEOPLE LIKE TO EAT PEANUTS ON THEIR BANANA SPLITS
WE ARE GOING TO CRASH
WAIT
BUT THE PLANE IS GOING TO
SHE DIDN'T LIKE BEING CALLED PEANUT LADY
I DIDN'T LIKE TO THINK ABOUT THAT BUT I COULDN'T HELP IT THAT'S WHEN I MISSED MY PARENTS THE MOST
ONE THING ABOUT BEING BY YOURSELF ON AN AIRPLANE
YOU GO HIGHER THAN ANY MOUNTAIN AND YOU GO FASTER THAN ANY CAR
I TRIED TO WATCH THE MOVIE
JENNIFER TOOK ME INTO THE COCKPIT PIT AND THERE
IT WAS WORTH THE WHOLE TRIP JUST TO EAT A BANANA SPLIT WITH GRANDPA
HE WAS REALLY NICE BUT HE WOULDN'T PLAY GO FISH WITH ME
IMAGINE HOW HARD IT WOULD BE TO WORK ALL THOSE MILLIONS OF BUTTONS AND EAT PEANUTS AND GO TO THE BATHROOM
FINALLY WE LANDED
SO I STARTED YELLING HEY PEANUT LADY HEY PEANUT LADY
OH I STARTED THINKING WE MIGHT CRASH
I WAS GLAD THAT THERE WASN'T ANYONE NEXT TO ME
BECAUSE IT WAS THE TALLEST AND I WANTED IT TO CATCH UP TO THE RED BROWN BLUE YELLOW PURPLE AND BLACK ONES
I WAS GOING THERE TO SEE MY GRANDFATHER WE WERE GOING TO GO FISHING
SHE SAID THE CAPTAIN WAS INVITING ME TO SEE THE COCKPIT I THOUGHT AWESOME
AND I'LL ONLY SERVE BANANA SPLITS ON MY PLANE
HE LAUGHED EVEN THOUGH I WASN'T JOKING
AND THAT IF SHE WOULD
THE WAY I FIGURED IT MY GAME BOY
WHICH MADE ME HAVE TO GO TO THE BATHROOM EIGHT TIMES
IS GOING TOO FAST TO EVER STOP
SHE TOLD ME TO CALL HER JENNIFER INSTEAD
MY MOM GAVE ME A COLORING BOOK OF COOL LOOKING DRAGONS TO KEEP ME BUSY I COLORED THE DRAGON PICTURES ALL GREEN SO IT DIDN'T TAKE VERY LONG
AND I H
FOR SOME REASON SHE KEPT TRYING TO GIVE ME PEANUTS
SUDDENLY I THOUGHT WOW LOOK AT ALL OF THOSE BUTTONS
I HAD SEVEN COLA'S AND FOUR GINGER ALE'S BY THE TIME
I GUESS IT WAS BECAUSE THE PLANE WAS SO LOUD AND I DIDN'T KNOW ANYONE
THE FLIGHT ATTENDANT GAVE ME A DECK OF CARDS BUT SHE WOULDN'T PLAY GO FISH WITH ME
THAT'S ALWAYS SCARY BECAUSE IT SEEMS LIKE EVEN THOUGH YOU ARE
THEN HE TOLD ME THAT HE ONCE PLAYED A GAME
ON THE GROUND
I DIDN'T KNOW ANYONE AT ALL AND HAD TO GO ALL THE WAY FROM NEW YORK TO TEXAS WITHOUT MY PARENTS
I SAID SOMEDAY I'M GOING TO BE A PILOT
IT WAS
BUT IT WASN'T PEANUTS IT WAS SOMETHING REALLY COOL
I TOLD HER THAT IT WAS THE PEANUTS THAT WERE MAKING ME SO THIRSTY IN THE FIRST PLACE
AND YOU CAN BE A PILOT THEN I COULD BE A PILOT TOO SINCE I'M MUCH BETTER AT PUSHING BUTTONS THAN YOU ARE
I HAD A GAME BOY IN MY BACKPACK MY BACKPACK WAS IN THE OVERHEAD THINGY
F
ONCE THE PLANE WAS IN THE AIR I WAS PRETTY GOOD
BUT SHE DID GET ME MY GAME BOY
EVEN THE FLIGHT ATTENDANT SEEMED A LITTLE ANNOYED THAT I HAD TO GO TO THE BATHROOM SO MUCH BUT IT WAS HER FAULT
IS THAT THE FLIGHT ATTENDANTS ARE VERY NICE TO YOU
AND THERE WERE LIKE A MILLION BUTTONS AND LEVERS AND KNOBS AND STUFF
BUT I HAD ALREADY SEEN THAT ONE SO IT WAS BORING
BUT TO TELL YOU THE TRUTH WITHOUT MY PARENTS THERE I WAS PRETTY NERVOUS
FINALLY WE LANDED
THE PILOT TOLD ME THAT IT WASN'T REALLY THAT HARD ONCE YOU PRACTICED
THAT'S ALWAYS SCARY BECAUSE IT SEEMS LIKE EVEN THOUGH WE WERE
THE PERSON NEXT TO ME WOULD HAVE BEEN VERY ANNOYED
SHE TOLD ME TO BE QUIET AND WATCH THE MOVIE
I'VE ALWAYS THOUGHT FLYING WAS FUN
GRANDPA LAUGHED THEN TOOK ME STRAIGHT TO THE ICE CREAM SHOP
I ALSO BROUGHT MY DECK OF CARDS IN CASE THE PILOT WAS BORED AND WANTED TO PLAY GO FISH
GET ME A BANANA SPLIT I WOULDN'T HAVE TO GO THE BATHROOM SO MUCH
HE SAID HE THOUGHT I WOULD MAKE A GREAT PILOT SOMEDAY IF I WANTED TO BE
ONLY HAS FIVE BUTTONS AND I CAN'T GET PAST LEVEL THREE
I TRIED TO PUSH THE BUTTON THAT LIGHTS UP SO THE FLIGHT ATTENDANT WOULD COME BUT GUESS WHAT I WAS TOO SHORT TO REACH THE BUTTON
I ONLY USED THE GREEN CRAYON BECAUSE
I PLAYED ON MY GAME BOY UNTIL I GOT MY NEW HIGH SCORE
BUT I TOLD HER THAT I WOULD LIKE A BANANA SPLIT INSTEAD
I HAD ON MY GAME BOY AND HE COULDN'T EVEN PASS LEVEL ONE
THEN I THOUGHT THERE'S NO WAY THAT ANYONE CAN REMEMBER TO PUSH ALL THOSE BUTTONS AT THE RIGHT TIME
SHE SAID THAT SHE HAD TO HELP OTHER PASSENGERS
WE ARE ON THE GROUND
I WAS STARTING
WE WERE ON THE
THAT THE PLANE IS GOING TOO FAST TO EVER STOP
THE AIRPLANE RIDE
FOR FRED WHEN IT CAME TO THE PANDAS HE HAD A WARM SPOT IN HIS HEART
WHICH YOUNG LADY HELPS PAY FOR THE BAMBOO THAT YOU EAT
IT'S NOT THAT YOU AREN'T SELLING ENOUGH STUFFED PANDA BEARS IT'S JUST THAT THERE HAVEN'T BEEN ENOUGH PEOPLE COMING TO SEE YOU IN THE FIRST PLACE I THINK WHAT THE ZOO NEEDS IS A GREAT ADVERTISING CAMPAIGN
I SEE YOUR WINGS FLAPPING BUT WE DON'T SEEM TO BE GOING ANYWHERE SAID YIN YIN
YES BUT WHAT DOES THAT HAVE TO DO WITH THE PANDAS MA PANDAS MAN SAID THE ZOO MANAGER
IT IS INTERESTING TO PO TO POINT OUT THAT THIS TIME THAT MORE STUFFED PANDA BEARS ARE SOLD AT THE ZOO GIFT SHOPS THEN ALL OF THE OTHER STUFF ANIMALS COMBINED
SHE SAID SPITEFULLY AN INSTANT LATER THE YOUNG BOY WAS HEARD SAYING OUCH MOM CUT THAT OUT I'M SORRY TO SAY BUT MANY A LITTLE BOY'S CHEEKS HAVE BEEN MADE RAW WHEN MOTHER POO POO PANDA WAS UPSET
A WEEK LATER MAGGIE MANAGED TO ROUND UP TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND AND SEVENTY EIGHT MAGPIE
THE PANDA
BUT LATER WHEN FRED WALKED INTO THE PANDA'S HOME UNDER A HIS NEW YELLOW UMBRELLA ALL SHE COULD THINK TO SAY WAS NONSENSE
ACTUALLY IT WAS EIGHTY FIVE POINT FIVE DEGREE SPOT ON HIS LEFT KIDNEY BUT THE POINT IS THAT HE WAS VERY FOND OF FEEDING THE PANDAS
HE WANTED TO BE A BUSINESS MAN BUT INSTEAD BECAME A GREAT EXPLORER
OH OH WELL THAT MAKES SENSE THEN THE MAN MANAGER SAID DID YOU KNOW THAT SINCE THE LITTLE PANDA BUILT THAT BAMBOO ROCKET SHIP AND THOSE MAGPIE'S STARTED FLUTTERING ABOUT THAT THE ZOO'S PROFITS HAVE GONE UP FOUR THOUSAND PERCENT
I DON'T THINK IT WILL TAKE THAT LONG TO ROLL THERE SAID YIN YIN
SO THEN ITSELF WAS NOT THAT ASTONISHING
NOW WHILE ALL THIS WAS GOING ON WHAT DO YOU SUPPOSED FRED WAS DOING WHY HE WAS FEEDING THE PANDAS LIKE HE WAS SUPPOSED TO
THE TURTLES WEREN'T SO BAD BUT AS FOR THE TIGERS HE WASN'T SO SURE
NONSENSE
SAN ANGELES
A LOT OF BAMBOO CAN CAN GET QUITE HEAVY SO BECAUSE OF THE PANDAS FRED BECAME VERY STRONG AND WAS IN TERRIFIC SHAPE BUT PHYSICAL FITNESS WAS NOT THE ONLY REASON THAT FRED LOVED THE PANDAS
YIN YIN'S FATHER MOO MAN DIDN'T THINK IT WAS VERY PROPER OR WISE FOR A YOUNG PANDA BEAR TO GO ROLLING OFF TO PLACES WHERE THERE WASN'T ANY BAMBOO BUT HE WAS SUPPORTIVE OF HIS YOUNG DAUGHTER AND SHOWED HIS SUPPORT BY MAKE TAKING A NAP
THOSE PANDA WILL SH THOSE PANDAS
THE FATHER WATCHING THIS ALL THROUGH ONE EYE FOR HE HAD ALWAYS HAD AT LEAST ONE EYE ASLEEP AT ALL TIMES
YIN YIN WAS ALWAYS ONE TO TAKE GOOD ADVICE FROM HER FATHER AND LESS THAN A WEEK LATER YIN YIN AND MAGGIE HAD BUILT A ROCKET SHIP OUT OF BAMBOO
HER MOTHER AND FATHER KNEW WHAT THEY WERE TALKING ABOUT SINCE THEY HADN'T THOUGHT OR TALKED MUCH OF ELSE SINCE YIN YIN SAID I WANT TO GO THERE AND POINTED TO THE MOON
A WEEK LATER DESPITE MUCH FLAPPING THEY WERE STILL TRYING AND TO GET THE ROCKET IN THE AIR
IT WAS FRED'S IDEA SO LET'S BEGIN WITH FRED
I KNOW I SHOULDN'T BE TELLING YOU THIS BUT WE MIGHT HAVE TO SELL YOU AND YOUR OTHER AND YOUR FAMILY TO THE BIG ZOO IN SAN
THEY WERE IN ORDER OF CUTENESS YIN YIN THE YOUNG DAUGHTER POO POO THE MOTHER MOO AND MOO MAN THE GENTLE ALWAYS SLEEPY FATHER
TO HUG THE PALM TREE QUICKLY SAID IT COSTS SO MUCH TO FEED YOU PANDA BEARS I WOULD HATE IF YOU HAD TO LEAVE US A AFTER ALL IT'S THE ONLY HOME YOU KNOW
FRED THOUGHT ABOUT IT AND SAID YOU KNOW I THINK W WE SHOULD RENAME YIN YIN COLUMBUS BUT THE ZOOKEEPER SAID GOOD HEAVENS MAN THAT IS A GREAT IDEA NO WAIT A SECOND I DON'T UNDERSTAND
HOW DO YOU TURN YOUR HEAD ALL THE WAY AROUND WITHOUT GETTING A TERRIBLE PAIN IN YOUR NECK SAID OWL
BACK IN THE PANDA'S HOME THE MOTHER PANDA POO POO WAS VERY PROUD OF HER DAUGHTER
SAID WHAT'S GOING ON WITH YOUR PANDAS FRED I'VE NEVER SEEN ANYTHING LIKE IT
IT'S IT'S YOUR JOB YOUR JOB IS TO BE CUTE SO PEOPLE WANT TO RUN TO THE GIFT SHOP AND BUY PANDA BEAR DOLLS
IF WE DON'T GET MORE MONEY
MAGGIE FIGURED THAT IF A THAT IF SHE AND THREE OF HER STRONGEST MAGPIE FRIENDS WERE EACH TO GRAB HOLD OF THE CORNER OF A ROCKET SHE COULD THEY COULD ALL FLY TO THE MOON SO THEY TRIED
IT'S A LAW OF NATURE AT FURTHER DISTANCES PANDAS HAVE STRANGE ALMOST MAGICAL EFFECT ON HUMAN BEINGS WHICH MAKES US WANT TO HUG AND SQUEEZE THINGS
IF YOU I IF YOU MUST GO IT WOULD BE BEST TO FLY
YES THE BIG ONE IN THE SKY THAT IS MOST LIKELY NOT MADE OF CHEESE AND MOST CERTAINLY NOT MADE OF BAMBOO
NO HOW MANY MAGPIE'S WOULD WE N WOULD BE NEEDED TO FLY FOUR HUNDRED A FOUR HUNDRED POUND PANDA BEAR AND A ONE HUNDRED POUND BAMBOO ROCKET SHIP TO THE MOON SAID MAGGIE
SUCH NONSENSE GOING TO THE MOON SAID HER MOTHER POO POO
SAID THE MANAGER DO YOU KNOW THAT SINCE THE ZOO'S PROFITS HAVE GONE UP FOUR THOUSAND PERCENT THIS IS JUST THE TYPE OF EXPOSURE HE NEEDED
HMM HEAVIER THAN I THOUGHT I THINK WE WILL NEED NEED MORE MAGPIES SAID MAGGIE YES BUT HOW MANY MORE YIN YIN SAID I'M NOT SURE EXACTLY REPLY REPLIED MAGGIE
FRED WAS STARTING TO FEEL UNCONTROLLABLE URGE TO HUG THE PANDA SO BEFORE HE RAN OFF TO HUG THE PALM TREE
WELL IT SEEMS TO ME SIR THAT YIN YIN WANTED TO BE A GREAT EXPLORER AND INSTEAD OF BECAME
THIS CAN ALMOST CERTAINLY BE ACCOUNTED FOR BY THIS STRANGE ALMOST MAGICAL EFFECT THAT THE PANDAS POSSESS
SHE COULD BE VERY PERSUASIVE A VERY LITTLE PERSUASIVE BIRD WHEN SHE WANTED TO
WHO LOOKED A LOT LIKE A PANDA WOULD LOOK IF A PAN IF PANDAS WERE BIRDS WERE DISCUSSING ABOUT GOING TO THE MOON
WHY DID THE PANDA WITH A BEAUTIFUL GIRL NAME YIN YIN HAVE HER NAME CHANGED TO THE VERY UN BEAUTIFUL GIRL NAME COLUMBUS
BUT EVERYTHING WAS NOT ALL BAMBOO AND HUGS AT THE ZOO ONE MORNING FRED WAS FEEDING YIN YIN AND SAID OH YIN YIN I WISH THAT MORE PEOPLE WOULD COME TO VISIT THE ZOO
AS FOR YIN YIN SHE WAS B VERY PROUD TO RE BE RENAMED AFTER A FAMOUS EXPLORER AND SHE AND MAGGIE NEVER STOPPED TRYING TO GET TO THE MOON
THERE WERE THREE PANDAS AND THEY WERE KNOWN AS THE PAN FAMILY
THEIR WONDERFUL HOME
THIS IS JUST THE TYPE OF EXPOSURE WE NEEDED THOSE PANDAS WILL BE WITH US FOR A LONG TIME
SO MAGGIE FLEW TO THE OWL AND ASKED FOR HIS ADVICE OH WISE OWL I HAVE A QUESTION THAT I FEAR ONLY YOU CAN ANSWER SHE SAID
AT LEAST TO YIN YINS PARENTS FRED SURE WAS IMPRESSED THOUGH
THE ZOO MANAGER LAUGHED AND WALKED AWAY BUT DID PATCH PURCHASE A FASHIONABLE YELLOW UMBRELLA FOR FRED THE NEXT DAY
THE MAIN OBSTACLE IT TURNS OUT WAS GETTING THE ROCKET SHIP OFF THE GROUND
BUT BEFORE HE FELL ASLEEP HE DID MANAGE TO SAY I BELIEVE ROLLING IS A DECIDEDLY ROUND ABOUT WAY TO GO
THE OTHER REASON WAS THAT ANYONE WHO GETS WITHIN THREE FEET OF A PANDA AUTOMATICALLY FALLS IN LOVE WITH THEM
BUT YIN YIN THE YOUNG PANDA WAS NOT LISTENING TO FRED SHE WAS TALKING TO HER BEST FRIEND MAGGIE THE MAGPIE ABOUT GOING TO THE MOON
BUT I JUST LEARNED HOW TO MAKE MYSELF INTO A BALL AND ROLL TWO AND ROLL TWO DAYS AGO AND I'M BECOMING VERY GOOD AT IT
SAID T'WAS WOULD BE BEST TO ASK THE OWL THEN CLOSED HIS EYE
THIS BAMBOO BAMBOO WAS A VERY WORKABLE SUBSTANCE AND PANDAS TEND TO HANDLE BAMBOO A LOT
WANTED TO BE A GREAT EXPLORER AND INSTEAD BECAME A BUSINESS WOMAN
IT TURNS OUT THAT THE OWL DIDN'T TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION THAT ONCE YOU GET OVER ONE THOUSAND MAGPIE TOGETHER THEY TEND TO FIGHT AND CAN'T AGREE ON A SINGLE THING
ENOUGH OF THIS NONSENSE SAID YIN YIN'S MOTHER POO POO
WHAT SORT OF NONSENSE IS THIS FOR A YOUNG PANDA BEAR GOING TO THE MOON INDEED
FRED FED THE PANDA BEARS THE TIGERS AND TURTLES
MANY PEOPLE KNOW THAT PANDAS EAT BAMBOO A LOT OF IT
BESIDES IF YOU LEAVE I'LL GET TERRIBLY OUT OF SHAPE NOW IF YOU'LL EXCUSE ME I NEED TO SQUEEZE SOMETHING BEFORE I SCREAM
WELL SIR WHEN COLUMBUS SET OUT ON HIS SHIP HE WAS REALLY TRYING TO FIND A QUICKER WAY TO GET TO GET AROUND EUROPE IN ORDER TO IMPROVE TRADE
AFTER ALL IF IT WEREN'T FOR YIN YIN THEY WOULD HAVE THEY WOULD HAVE HAD TO MOVE FOR FROM
IT'S TAKEN ME A COUPLE OF WEEKS TO FIGURE IT OUT BUT I THINK YIN YIN WANTS TO GO TO THE MOON AND THE MAGPIES WANT TO TAKE HER THERE FRED SAID FRED
IT'S SIMPLE ECONOMICS LIKE IT OR NOT WE ARE SPOKESPEOPLE FOR THE PANDA STUFFED ANIMAL INDUSTRY
NO ONE COULD BLAME FRED REALLY FRED WASN'T A NAIL BITER SO BEGAN BEING EATEN WAS DEFINITELY NOT SOMETHING HE LOOKED FORWARD TO EACH AFTERNOON AT THREE O'CLOCK WHEN IT WAS TIME TO FEED THE TIGERS
OH WELL THAT MAKES SENSE THEN
ONE TWO THREE TO THE MOON THEY SAID TOGETHER PULLING IT WITH ALL THEIR MIGHT
NONSENSE SAID THE MOTHER I'M SO MAD I'M GOING TO LOOK AT THAT LADY OVER THERE AND MAKE HER WANT TO SQUEEZE HER SON'S SON CHEEKS
FRED WAS NOT ALLOWED TO ACTUALLY HUG THE PANDA BEARS SINCE THEY COULD BE DANGEROUS SO ALL THE OTHER PEOPLE AT THE ZOO WOULD KNOW THAT THE PANDAS HAD JUST BEEN FED WHEN THEY SAW FRED HUGGING THE RATHER UN CUDDLY PALM TREE OUTSIDE OF THE PANDA'S HOME
THE OWL INSTANTLY REPLIED TWO HUNDRED TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND AND SEVENTY SIX GIVE OR TAKE TWO
YIN YIN AND HER BEST FRIEND MAGGIE THE MAGPIE WHO LOOKED A LOT LIKE A PANDA IF
THAT WE SEE ON TV ON THE ANIMAL CH CHANNEL
PLUS IF YOU WEREN'T ALWAYS CUDDLING WITH MY SISTER SO MUCH MAYBE YOU WOULD HAVE BEEN WITH THE WITH HER CAT
YOU SHOULD BE PROUD OF ME FOR THINKING SO FAST ON MY TOES
CAN I GET A DOG PLEASE
HE HER HAIR WOULD GROW BACK HARDER EACH TIME AND SOON SHE WOULD HAVE AN INVINCIBLE COAT OF CAT FUR ARMOR
DAD PLEASE DON'T READ THE NEXT PART
I CAN PRACTICE BY SHAVING JENNY'S HEAD
I MEAN IT'S BE SU IT'LL BE SUMMER SOON ENOUGH AND I JUST WANTED THE CAT TO GET S GET USED TO THE IDEA BEFORE IT REALLY GOT HOT
DEAR MOM AND DAD
OH SURE IT'S EASY TO SAY THAT I SHOULD HAVE JUST PICKED UP THE CAT BUT SOMETIMES WE DON'T ALWAYS THINK ALL THAT GREAT UNDER PRESSURE
THE CAT LIKED BEING SHAVED ANYWAY SO I DIDN'T SEE THE BIG DEAL
DID YOU KNOW THAT I WANTED TO BE A BARBER
SINCERELY DANNY
AND THE CAT WAS BEING CHASED BY THE TURTLE AND RAN RIGHT BY THE CLIPPERS AND SHAVED HERSELF
YOU WOULDN'T ALWAYS TAKE THE CAT'S SI YOU WOULD AL YOU WOULDN'T ALWAYS TAKE THE CAT'S SIDE IF YOU KNEW THE STUFF HE DID TO POOR TURTLE TO MY POOR TURTLE
YOU BOUGHT MEAN SHE'S REALLY HER CAT IT CAUSE SHE'S SO RESPONSIBLE AND STU AND STUFF
I REALLY DIDN'T MEAN TO S SHAVE THAT THE CAT REALLY I SWEAR
I WAS AFRAID TO TELL YOU THE REAL REASON I SHAVED THE CAT WAS THAT BECAUSE I WANT TO BE A BARBER AND I NEEDED PRACTICE
THEY ARE CALLED HAIRLESS CATS AND AND THEY NEED FUR IN THE WINTER SOMETIMES I THINK I SWEAR THAT'S THE REASON
THAT'S JUST MY OPINION THOUGH
I'M GETTING HUNGRY AND I'M SORRY FOR SHAVING THE CAT ALTHOUGH YOU CAN SEE THAT IT'S REALLY JENNY'S FAULT FOR NOT BEING THE RESPONSIBLE AS YOU ALWAYS SAY AND NOT BRUSHING HER TEETH
EVEN IF SHE IS DUMB LITTLE TATTLE'TALE
I I KNOW HOW MUCH YOU HATE HIM ALWAYS SNEEZING AND SO I THOUGHT IF I GOT RID OF THE FUR HE WOULDN'T SNEEZE
NOT THAT I SHAVED THE CAT THOUGH
PLEASE SHAVE THE CAT IT KEEPS HITTING ON MY SHELL AND TRYING TO ROLL ME OVER WHEN WHEN YOU LEAVE THE ROOM
I WOULD LIKE TO START BY SAYING THAT I THINK THAT YOU ARE VERY MEAN TO MAKE ME DO THIS BECAUSE IT WASN'T EVEN MY FAULT
ALSO I AM GOING TO SELL THE CAT FUR AND BUY MY SISTER JENNY BRACES FOR HER BIG STUPID FACE
THEY JUST RA RAN ON IN THE STUPID WHEEL AND DID STUPID THINGS
THE ONLY REASON IT IT HASN'T COME OUT F FOR TWO WEEKS IS BECAUSE YOU GUYS MADE SUCH A BIG DEAL OUT OF IT POOR KITTY AND THAT A THIS AND POOR KITTY THAT
I COULDN'T BUY HIM ANY ANYTHING NICE SINCE YOU TOOK AWAY M MY ALLOWANCE FOR SHAVING THE NEIGHBOR'S DOG
BUT THE REAL REASON I SHAVED THE CAT WAS TO MAKE A WIG FOR THOSE POOR HAIR LESS CATS
SEE SHE'S NOT RESPONSIBLE AFTER ALL
LAST NIGHT I SAW THAT SHE DIDN'T BRUSH HER TEETH OH YEAH I FORGOT TO TELL YOU THAT
I SAW THE CAT WAS TRYING TO GET TO GET THE GERBILS AND YOU TOLD US WE COULDN'T HIT ANIMALS SO I DIDN'T
ASK HER SHE SAID THAT SH THAT WHEN WE SHAVE HAIR IT GROWS BACK HARDER SOMETIMES EVEN DARKER
IT'S YOUR FAULT REALLY
YOU GUYS WILL JUST PROBABLY SAY IT'S WINTER DANNY CATS DON'T OVERHEAT IN WINTER
INSTEAD THE THE CAT CAME INTO MY ROOM BECAUSE JENNY NEVER PLAYS WITH IT LI
I KNEW OUR CAT WOULD GROW HER FUR BACK BUT SOME CATS DON'T HAVE HAIR
SO IN MY CONCLUSION
I THINK THAT SHE SHOULD BRUSH HER TEETH TWICE TONIGHT
DEAR MOM DON'T LET DAD KNOW THE REAL REASON I SHAVED THE CAT WAS BECAUSE ALWAYS SNEEZING AROUND IT
THEN SHE WOULD BE A SUPER CAT AND YOU COULD TAKE HER ON TV SHOWS AND GET LOTS OF MONEY SO THAT YOU CAN BUY JENNY'S COLLEGE
PLUS OSCAR PLUS OSCAR MY TURTLE TOLD ME TO SHAVE THE CAT
I'LL PROMISE THAT I'LL DO BETTER JOB THEN I DID ON THE CAT BECAUSE NOW I HAVE WHAT DAD CALLS LIFE EXPERIENCE
FI FINE OSCAR CAN'T REALLY TALK BUT IF HE COULD HE WOULD HAVE SAID
SINCE YOU HAVE GROUNDED ME AND TOLD ME TO WRITE DOWN WHY I AM SORRY BEFORE I WAS ALLOWED OUT OF MY ROOM I AM MAD AT YOU
AND YOU KNOW WHAT THOSE STUPID GERBILS DIDN'T EVEN THANK ME
I THINK IT REALLY LIKES THE ITS HAIRCUT
SO IT REALLY WAS MY FATHER'S DAY GIFT TO HIM
I KEPT SAYING NO KITTY NO DON'T SHAVE YOURSELF
BUT MY STUPID SISTER NEVER TAUGHT HER CAT HOW TO LISTEN SO SHE JUST IGNORED ME
CAT'S AREN'T ALWAYS NICE JUST LIKE MY SISTER JENNY ISN'T ALWAYS NICE
OK HERE'S WHAT HAPPENED AS I REMEMBER IT
JUST CAUSE SHE'S A GOOD STUDENT DOESN'T MEAN SHE'S REALLY RESPONSIBLE
THAT YOU SHOULD BE BLAMING MS CASPER MY SCIENCE TEACHER SHE MADE MADE US SHAVE SOMETHING FOR SCIENCE
I JUST DIDN'T WANT TO SEE THE CAT GETTING ALL HOT AND UNCOMFORTABLE AND STUFF
I WAS
ENOUGH
PS IF YOU WOULD HAVE BROUGHT BROUGHT HER BOUGHT HER A TURTLE I COULDN'T HAVE SHAVED IT
I'LL BET YOU DIDN'T KNOW SOMETHING ELSE
AND AND THAT YOU WOULD HAVE A BETTER MARRIAGE
SHE'S S SHE'S SO GOOD AT SCHOOL AND YOU BROUGHT ME SHE
ACTUALLY THE TRUTH IS TH THAT BY A I I I BY ACCIDENT TURNED ON THE NOSE HAIR CLIP CLIP CLIPPERS
YOU GUYS NEVER LIKED OSCAR AS MUCH AS THE CAT ANYWAY
I COULDN'T HELP IT ANYWAY IT WAS AN ACCIDENT AND I DIDN'T EVEN DO IT ON PURPOSE
PLUS I I FORGOT TO TELL YOU THAT
THAT'S THE LAST TIME I SHAVE THE CAT TO PROTECT ANY STUPID GERBILS
HOW COME JENNY GETS A CAT AND I GET A STUPID TURTLE ANYWAY
IF I HAD A CAT I KNOW THAT YOU SHOULD TEACH A CAT TO SHAVE ITSELF
I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT ELSE TO DO SO I GRABBED DAD'S NOSE HAIR C CLIPPERS AND SHAVED IT
TURTLES DON'T HAVE DO ANYTHING EXCEPT POKE THEIR HEADS OUT AND NOT BE CUDDLY
DEAR MOM AND DAD JENNY DIDN'T BRUSH HER TEETH LAST NIGHT I THINK THAT YOU SHOULD
SO I THOUGHT THAT IF I COULD SHAVE THE CAT A LOT OF A BUNCH OF TIMES
BUT SO WHAT IF IT'S WINTER
AFRAID THAT YOU WOULDN'T LET ME PRACTICE ON MY OWN HEAD
THAT AFTERNOON MR BLANDSWORTH SHOWED THE CLASS HIS FAVORITE SHADOW PICTURES THIS IS KID'S STUFF SAID THE CLASS
WE SHOULD HAVE GOTTEN RID OF MRS WE SHOULDN'T HAVE GOTTEN RID OF MRS BLANDSWORTH THEY SAID
HOT DOG CRIED THE CLASS WE GET RID OF BLANDSWORTH NOW WE CAN DO JUST AS WE PLEASE AND THE STROKE OF TEN KIDS FROM TWO OH SEVEN LEFT THE BUILDING NO ONE STOPPED THEM
AND THEY PRACTICED SOME VERY DIFFICULT STUNT WORK IN THE BACK YARD
ER SAID THE KIDS THEY DECIDED NOT TO MENTION V MISS VIOLA SWAMP BUT THEY WONDERED WHY MISS NELSON HADN'T BEEN SEEN HER IN THE HALL

SOMETHING WILL HAVE TO BE DONE AND SHE WENT TO HER CLOSET
IF WE GET MRS IF WE GET THE SWAMP I'LL JUST DIE SAID ONE KID

THAT'S RIGHT SAID MISS SWAMP AND I'M HERE TO WHIP THIS CLASS INTO SHAPE GET BACK TO THOSE D DESKS ON THE DOUBLE
MR BLANDSWORTH WAS SURPRISED YOU'RE BACK SOONER THAN WE EXPECTED HE SAID
A MINUTE LATER MISS NELSON APPEARED I'M BACK SHE SAID
SOMETHING WILL HAVE TO BE DONE THEY SAID WE MUST GET RID OF BLANDSWORTH THEY HAD TO HATCH A PLOT
MISS SWAMP IS THE MEANEST SUBSTITUTE IN THE WHOLE WORLD SAID THE BIG KID NOBODY ACTS UP WHEN SHE'S AROUND
MISS NELSONS COULDN'T BELIEVE HER EYES THOSE ARE MY KIDS SHE SAID WITH A SCRATCHY VOICE WHAT ARE THEY DOING OUT OF SCHOOL AND WHO'S WITH THEM
YOU DON'T SAY SAID MRS SWAMP MISS SWAMP PROBABLY JUST SOME OF THE KIDS ACTING UP I'M SURE IT WON'T HAPPEN AGAIN AND MRS BLAN BLANDSWORTH LEFT
AFTERWARD THEY WENT TO LUCY'S WHERE THEY STUFFED THEMSELVES SILLY BUT SOON THEY MADE SERIOUS MISTAKE
BACK IN TWO OH FI UHM BACK IN TWO OH SEVEN SEVEN MISS NELSON'S KIDS WERE SPENDING AN AGREEABLE AFTERNOON THEY WERE VERY PLEASED I WAS PLEASED WITH THEMSELVES
BUT AT RECESS IT WAS ANOTHER STORY WOW SAID THE KIDS WHILE MISS NELSON IS AWAY WE CAN REALLY ACT UP
MISS NELSON IS BACK
SHE KNEW HOW TO GET THE RESULTS THE CLASS DID A WHOLE WEEK'S WORTH IN NO TIME
WELL IN THAT CASE SAID THE PRINCIPAL I'LL BE GETTING BACK TO THE OFFICE NOW NICE TO HAVE YOU BACK MISS NELSON AND HE LEFT THE ROOM
HOT DOG CRIED THE KIDS ARE WE GLAD TO SEE YOU DIDN'T YOU HAVE FUN WITH MR BLANDSWORTH ASKED MISS NELSON
AND HE HUNG UP CAN'T FOOL ME SAID MISS NELSON HMM SAID MISS NELSON
WHEN ALL TURTLES ARRIVED THERE
THIS TURTLE'S WAS NAMED SWISH
EVEN I WAS FASTER THAN YOU WHEN I WAS YOUR AGE YOU'RE CHEATING YOU'RE GOING TO RUIN THE GREAT RACE FOREVER
THE TURTLE CUP WAS THE TROPHY THAT THE WINNER COULD TAKE HOME TO THEIR VILLAGE
EVERYONE TREATED SWISH DIFFERENTLY
THE CROWD THOUGHT HE MUST HAVE REALIZED THAT IT WASN'T WORKING
THEN HE HEARD THE MAYOR SAY RUNNERS PLEASE TAKE YOUR POSITIONS
MUD DIDN'T ANSWER
SO WITH SWISH THEY THOUGHT MAYBE JUST MAYBE HE COULD BRING BACK THE TURTLE CUP
THAT'S NOT A ROCK SWEETIE SAID HIS MOM THAT'S MUD
BUT AFTER A FEW HOURS MOST OF THE TURTLES HAD GONE A FEW FEET ALL EXCEPT TWO
SHE SAID SWISH YOU ARE THE YOUNGEST WINNER OF THE GREAT TURTLE RACE THAT WAS THE MOST EXCITING FINISH WE'VE EVER HAD
THIS WAS SWISH'S FIRST EVER SHELL DWELLERS FESTIVAL HE THOUGHT IT WAS THE MOST WONDERFUL THING HE EVER SAW
CHEERED FOR SWISH
SURE THEY ARE NICE TO ME NOW BECAUSE THEY THINK I CAN WIN THE RACE BUT IF I LOSE THEY'LL BE DISAPPOINTED AND MAD AT ME
RULE NUMBER TWO ALL TURTLES MUST RUN AS FAST AS THEY CAN AND THE TURTLE THAT IS CLOSEST TO THE STARTING LINE WINS
EVERYTHING ABOUT THE FESTIVAL WAS FUN BUT THE MAIN EVENT WAS THE GREAT TURTLE RACE
SHE ANNOUNCED WELL MUD IT LOOKS LIKE YOU'VE DONE IT SLUDGE POND WINS THE TURTLE CUP AGAIN
HE WAS TIRED FROM RACING AND THOUGHT THAT IT WOULD BE NICE TO JUST LISTEN TO MUD'S SWEET VOICE AND FALL ASLEEP
MOSTLY NICE TURTLES
HE WOULD NEVER LOSE THE TURTLE CUP FOR THE REST OF HIS LONG LIFE
SWISH'S MOM SMILED AND SAID
IMAGINE HE HADN'T HE HADN'T HAD TO MOVE FOR OVER FIFTY YEARS
MUD FROM SLUDGE POND HAS BEEN DISQUALIFIED FOR SLEEPING DURING THE RACE
THEN THE TOWN PROMISED TO TREAT SWISH LIKE A NORMAL TURTLE AND AFTER A WHILE SWISH DECIDED THAT HE WOULD BE PROUD TO RACE FOR HIS VILLAGE
OH NO SHOUTED THE FANS MUD'S WINNING IT LOOKS LIKE MUD IS STILL THE GREATEST TURTLE OF THEM ALL
MRS SNAPPER WOULD SAY HI SWISHY DO YOU WANT SOME YUMMY PIE TO FILL YOU UP AND SLOW YOU DOWN FOR THE BIG RACE A FAT TURTLE IS A SLOW TURTLE
AFTER SEVEN DAYS OF PLAYING AND DANCING AND BUG EATING FINALLY THE DAY OF THE RACE CAME
THE TURTLES STRETCHED AND THOUGHT REALLY SLOW THOUGHTS AS THEY AS THEY DID THE SKY TURNED FROM BLACK TO DARK BLUE
THEN HE TOLD SWISH ALL OF MUD'S DIRTY TRICKS SO THAT SWISH WOULD BE READY FOR THEM
AFTER SIX HOURS MUD AND SWISH WERE STILL TIED AND HAD ONLY MOVED A FEW INCHES
TO BREAK THIS RULE WOULD MEAN AN END TO THE GREAT TURTLE RACE FOREVER
ALL THE TURTLES IN BLUE POND HELD A MEETING TO DISCUSS THE PROBLEM
SWISH WAS JUST HAPPY TOO WAS JUST HAPPY TOO BUT DEEP DOWN INSIDE HE KNEW HE WAS JUST AS SLOW AS MUD
ONCE HIS MOTHER CALLED HIM FOR DINNER HE DIDN'T MAKE IT HOME UNTIL BREAKFAST THE NEXT MORNING AND HE WAS ONLY A FOOT AWAY
YOU'RE JUST TRYING TO MAKE ME QUIT I'M NOT GOING TO FALL FOR YOUR TRICKS HE SAID HE SAID TURTLES NEVER CHEAT AND I'M A TURTLE WITH HONOR
SWISH TOOK THE CUP THAT DAY FOR THE FIRST TIME
REMEMBER THAT EVEN THOUGH HE'S GIFTED AT BEING SLOW HE'S STILL VERY YOUNG SAID SWISH'S FATHER
MUD HAD ACTUALLY SUNG HIMSELF TO SLEEP
HE WE ALL WANT YOU TO LOOK GOOD F WHEN YOU BRING HOME THE CUP
THERE WERE ABOUT THREE HUNDRED TURTLES RACING
SWISHES FATHER SAID SON DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT YOU KNOW MY GRANDFATHER RACED MUD ONCE
SWISH AND MUD WERE BOTH BACK AT THE STARTING LINE IT LOOKED AS IF NEITHER OF THEM HAD MOVED AT ALL
FOR THE FIRST TIME IN SIX HUNDRED YEARS I WOULD LIKE TO PRESENT THE TURTLE CUP TO BLUE POND THE CROWD WENT WILD AGAIN
LOOK THERE'S YOUR COUSIN PEEK A BOO FROM BIG PUDDLE VILLAGE SAID SWISH'S MOTHER YOU'LL GET TO MEET ALL SORTS OF NEW TURTLES
RULE NUMBER THREE NO TURTLE MAY PRETEND TO BE GOING AS FAST AS THEY CAN BUT GO SLOW INSTEAD
WHAT WHAT WOULD YOU LIKE TO SAY TO ALL THE TURTLES AT THE FESTIVAL
LIVE IN BLUE POND
MUCH GREATER OR BIGGER THAN MUD HE ALWAYS MADE SURE THAT NO ONE TREATED HIM SPECIAL AND THAT HE TREATED EVERYBODY LIKE HE WANTED TO BE TREATED
SWISH SAW A BIG ROCK IN THE MIDDLE OF THE FESTIVAL AND WONDERED ABOUT IT
ALL THE TURTLES WERE VERY VERY SLOW
THERE WAS THERE WERE MANY LEGENDS ABOUT HIM IT WAS RUMORED HE WAS SO SLOW HIS HEART WOULD ONLY B WOULD ONLY BEAT ONCE A DAY
SWISH HAD TO BE CARRIED ON HIS FATHER'S BACK SINCE IT WOULD HAVE TAKEN HIM YEARS TO GET TO GREAT POND BY HIMSELF
SWISH WAS SAD THAT HE LOST BUT ALL THE TURTLES FROM BLUE POND
MISTER PEEKS WOULD NEVER DO ANYTHING FOR FREE BUT HE WAS GIVING SWISH A FREE SHELL WAXING
THE RULES WERE NAILED TO THE TREE FOR ALL TO SEE
JUST THEN THE MAYOR SAID READY SET SLOW AND OFF THEY WENT
MUD KNEW THAT THIS WOULD BE HIS CLOSEST RACED EVER AND HE WAS ACTUALLY GETTING A LITTLE BIT SCARED OF THIS SWISH KID
THE LESS A TURTLE MOVES THE BIGGER THEY GET AND THE LONGER THEY LIVE
EVERY FOUR YEARS TURTLE FROM ALL OVER THE LAND WOULD C WOULD CRAWL TO GREAT POND
SO ONE DAY HE TOLD HIS PARENTS I DON'T WANT TO RACE
THEY WERE VERY PROUD HE GAVE MUD SUCH A CLOSE RACE
WHEN SWISH WAS BORN EVERYONE THOUGHT HE WAS A LITTLE SLOW BUT AS HE GOT A OLDER THE TURTLES BEGAN TO REALIZE THAT SWISH WAS REALLY REALLY REALLY SLOW
BUT SWISH WOULDN'T LET MUD SCARE HIM
MUD STILL DIDN'T ANSWER IN FACT MUD WAS SOUND ASLEEP
THE TURTLE CUP WAS IN A SLUDGE WAS IN SLUDGE POND FOR OVER FIFTY YEARS THAT'S BECAUSE NO ONE COULD EVER BEAT THE TURTLE FROM THERE
FOR EXAMPLE MISTER PEEKS THE LOCAL SHELL CLEANER WOULD SAY HEY THERE SWISH DO YOU WANT A FREE SHELL WAXING TODAY
BUT THEN RIGHT AT THE END RIGHT BEFORE THE SUNSET
THE MAYOR TAPPED MUD ON THE SHELL AND SAID HELLO HELLO MUD
YOU HAVE TO
THE SLOWEST TURTLES FROM EACH POND WERE CARRIED TO THE STARTING LINE BY MEMBERS OF THEIR VILLAGES
SWISH MADE A LOUD GULP SOUND
I THINK THAT YOU WILL BE A GREAT CHAMPION FOR MANY YEARS SINCE ONLY TURTLES ONLY GET SLOWER WITH AGE
THERE WERE THOUSANDS OF TURTLES OF MANY DIFFERENT SPECIES ALL HAVING A GREAT TIME
I NEVER PROMISED THAT I WOULD WIN THE RACE I CAN'T BEAT MUD ANYWAY I HEARD ONCE IT TOOK HIM THREE DAYS JUST TO YAWN
THIS TIME IT WAS A BIT CLOSER THAN YOU WOULD HAVE LIKED I'LL BET
UHM EXCEPT FOR MUD OF COURSE BUT WITHOUT HIM WE DON'T HAVE A CHANCE
THE WINNER OF THE GREAT TURTLE RACE WAS SO IMPORTANT THAT THE WINNER DIDN'T HAVE TO MOVE FOR FOUR YEARS UNTIL THE NEXT FESTIVAL
SWISH ALREADY
BUT THOUGH HE BECAME THE GREATEST AND BIGGEST TURTLE OF ALL TIME
I KNOW THAT YOU CAN WIN SWISH BUT WE'LL BE PROUD OF YOU EVEN IF YOU DON'T WIN IT'S AN HONOR JUST TO GET TO RACE SAID SWISH'S MOM
THEN HE SNAPPED OUT OF IT AND REMEMBERED HIS FATHER TOLD HIM ABOUT THIS TRICK GAVE HIM EARPLUGS
THIS MEANS THAT WE HAVE A NEW CHAMPION THE REAL WINNER IS SWISH SOFTBELLY AT BLUE POND THE CROWD WENT WILD
WHEN THE TIME OF THE FESTIVAL DREW NEAR ALL THE TURTLES ALL OVER THE LAND STARTED THEIR CRAWL TOWARD GREAT POND
HE WAS THE BIGGEST MOST RESPECTED AND ONE OF THE TRICKIEST TURTLES IN HISTORY
THE MAYOR OF GREAT POND MRS TORT PASSED THE RULES OF THE RACE FOR EVERYONE TO SEE
AND THEN WHEN THE SUN WENT DOWN MUD WAS THE CLOSEST TURTLE TO THE STARTING LINE
MRS SNAPPER WAS NEVER NICE TO ANYONE BUT HE WAS BUT HE WAS BEING NICE TO SWISH
THEY LOOKED AT THE HORIZON AND SAW THE SUN WAS STARTING THE RISE
BY NOW ALL THE TURTLES WERE WAY AHEAD OF MUD BUT THIS TIME SWISH WAS JUST AS SLOW
RULE NUMBER FOUR NO TURTLE MAY FALL ASLEEP SINCE IF YOU ARE ASLEEP YOU AREN'T RUNNING AS FAST AS YOU CAN
THE SLOWEST TURTLE
THE MAYOR OF PONDLAND WENT TO PRESENT TURTLE CUP TO SLUDGE POND AGAIN
THE MAYOR DOCTOR SOFTSHELL SAID THIS IS RIDICULOUS SWISH HAS TO RACE HE'S THE SLOWEST TURTLE I'VE EVERY SEEN
TURTLES COULD CATCH UP WITH FRIENDS THEY HAD NOT SEEN SINCE THE LAST FESTIVAL
HE WOULD TAKE IT MANY MORE TIMES AFTER THAT IT WAS BECAUSE OF SWISH THAT BLUE POND BECAME THE MOST RESPECTED POND IN THE LAND
YOU KNOW WHAT I'M GOING TO WIN THIS RACE I KNOW IT AND ALL THESE TURTLES WILL KNOW THAT BLUE POND RULES IM NOT AFRAID OF MUD
BLUE POND WAS LOCATED ABOUT THREE DAYS CRAWL FROM GREAT POND
THEN MUD TRIED ANOTHER TRICK HE STARTED SINGING IN A SOFT BEAUTIFUL LULLABY SWISH STARTED YAWNING
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN SAID MRS TROUT TORT
WE NEVER THOUGHT OF THAT THEY AGREED
HE WAS THE SLOWEST TURTLE OF ALL TIME
SWISH STARTED TO PULL AHEAD OF MUD
HE WASN'T AS SLOW AS YOU BUT HE DID TEACH ME A THING OR TWO
SWISH WAS SUDDENLY VERY EXCITED HE TOLD HIS MOM
THEY WERE BOTH MOVING OF COURSE BUT THEY WERE SO SLOW IT WAS HARD TO TELL
ALL TURTLE MUST GO AS FAST AS THEY CAN AT ALL TIMES SINCE TURTLES NEVER CHEAT THIS IS THE MOST IMPORTANT RULE
THE CROWD STARTED YELLING SPEECH SPEECH
BUT HE DOESN'T WANT TO BE TREATED SPECIAL HE JUST WANTS TO BE NORMAL AND HE DOESN'T WANT EVERYBODY TO HATE HIM IF HE CAN'T BEAT MUD
SWISH READ THE RULES EVEN THOUGH HE KNEW THEM BY HEART
LIKE A TURTLE WITH HONOR
HOW COME THEY DON'T MOVE THAT BIG ROCK OUT OF THE MIDDLE OF THE FIELD IT SEEMS TO BE IN EVERYONE'S WAY SAID SWISH
HE PUT THE EARPLUGS IN HIS EARS AND COULDN'T HEAR MUD'S SINGING ANYMORE
BUT THEY ALL FELT A LITTLE SAD BECAUSE THEY HADN'T HELD THE TURTLE CUP IN OVER SEVEN HUNDRED YEARS
MS TORT WENT UP TO SWISH AND GAVE HIM THE TURTLE CUP
FINALLY AFTER THE LONG JOURNEY ALL THE TURTLES ARRIVED AT GREAT POND
SO IT TOOK SOME TIME BEFORE ANYONE COULD FIGURE OUT WHICH TURTLES WERE THE SLOWEST
HIS NAME WAS MUD AND HE WAS THE GREATEST CHAMPION IN THE HISTORY OF THE SH SHELL DWELLERS FESTIVAL HE WAS UNBEATABLE
THEY READ RULE NUMBER ONE THE GREAT RACE BEGINS AT SUNRISE AND ENDS AT SUNSET
AND THE EXTRA ATTENTION MADE SWISH VERY UNCOMFORTABLE
WHO IS THIS YOUNG PUNK HE THOUGHT TO HIMSELF
SO YOU CAN SEE THE WINNING SO YOU CAN SEE WINNING THE GREAT RACE IS A GREAT HONOR
MUD KEPT SINGING HIS LULLABY FOR A FEW HOURS BUT HE STOPPED RIGHT BEFORE SUNSET
WHEN MUD WAS IN HIS PRIME THERE WAS A NEW TURTLE BORN IN BLUE POND
MUD SAID TO SWISH THERE'S NO WAY THAT A TURTLE AS YOUNG AS YOU CAN BE SO SLOW
IT WOULD TAKE SOME TURTLES FROM FAR AWAY VILLAGES T TWO WHOLE WEEKS JUST TO GET THERE
I KNOW I SHOULDN'T BE TELLING YOU THIS BUT WE MIGHT HAVE TO SELL YOU AND YOUR FAMILY TO THE BIG ZOO IN SAN ANGELES
NOW NO WAIT A SECOND I DON'T UNDERSTAND
BUT THE POINT IS THAT HE WAS VERY FOND OF FEEDING THE PANDAS
IT IT WAS FRED'S IDEA SO LET'S BEGIN WITH FRED
ABOUT THOSE MAGPIES FLYING ABOVE THE PANDAS DO YOU THINK THAT THE ZOO COULD PURCHASE ME A LARGE SIZE UMBRELLA
IT'S A LAW OF NATURE AF AT FUTURE AT FURTHER DISTANCE PANDAS HAVE A STRANGE ALMOST MAGICAL EFFECT ON HUMAN BEINGS WHICH MAKES US WANT TO HUG AND SQUEEZE THINGS
SO ONE DAY AFTER FRED FRED HAD FED THE PANDAS AND WAS HUGGING THE PALM TREE THE ZOO MANAGER CAME UP TO HIM AND SAID
THE THE MAIN OBSTACLE IT TURNS OUT WAS GETTING THE ROCKET SHIP OFF THE GROUND
NOW IF YOU EXCUSE ME I NEED TO SQUEEZE SOMETHING BEFORE I SCREAM SCREAM
THE OWL INTI INSTANTLY REPLIED TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND AND SIX AND SEVENTY SIX GIVE IT OR TAKE TWO
YIN YIN'S FATHER MOO MAN DIDN'T THINK IT WAS A VERY P PROPER OR WISE FOR A YOUNG PANDA BEAR TO GO ROLLING OFF TO PLACES WHERE THERE WASN'T ANY BAMBOO
I'M NOT EXACTLY QUI I'M NOT SURE EXACTLY REPLIED MAGGIE
AS FOR YIN YIN SHE WAS VERY PROUD TO BE RENAMED AFTER A FAMOUS EXPLORER AND SHE AND MAGPIE NEVER STOPPED TRYING TO GET TO THE MOON
ENOUGH OF THE NONSENSE UH NONSENSE SAID YIN YIN'S MOTHER POO POO
ONE MORNING FRED WAS FEEDING YIN YIN AND SAID OH YIN YIN I WISH THAT MORE PEOPLE WOULD COME TO VISIT THE ZOO
I'M SO MAD I'M GOING TO LOOK AT AT A LADY OVER THERE AND MAKE HER WANT TO SQUEEZE HER SON CHEEKS
HE WANTED TO BE A BUSINESS MAN BUT INSTEAD BECAME BECAME A GREAT EXPLORER
I THINK WHAT THE ZOO NEEDS IS A GREAT ADVERTISING CAMPAIGN
SLEEPY FATHER
ANIMAL INDUSTRY W WHICH YOUNG LADY HELPS PAY FOR THE BAMBOO THAT YOU EAT
WEREN'T SO BAD BUT AS FOR THE TIGERS HE HE WASN'T SO SURE
IF IT WEREN'T FOR YIN YIN THEY WOULD HAVE HAD TO MOVE FROM THEIR WONDERFUL HOME
IF YOU MUST GO IT
SHE COULD BE A VERY PERSUASIVE LITTLE BIRD WHEN SHE WANTED
OH WISE OWL I HAVE A QUESTION THAT I FEAR ONLY YOU CAN ANSWER SHE SAID
AN INSTANT LATER A YOUNG BOY WAS HEARD SAYING OUCH MOM CUT THAT OUT
IF WE DON'T GET MORE MONEY IT'S NOT THAT YOU AREN'T S SELLING ENOUGH STUFFED STUFFED PANDA BEARS
THERE WERE THEY WERE IN ORDER OF CUTENESS YIN YIN THE YOUNG DAUGHTER POO POO THE MOTHER AND MOO MAN THE GENTLE AND ALWAYS
IT'S SIMPLE ECONOMICS LIKE IT OR NOT WE ARE SPOKESPEOPLE FOR THE PANDA STUFFED ANIMALS
THE TURTLES WERE SO BAD BUT
YES THE BIG ONE IN THE SKY THAT IS MOST LIKELY NOT MADE OF CHEESE AND MOST CERTAINLY NOT MADE OF BAMBOO
BACK IN THE PANDA'S HOME THE MOTHER PANDA POO POO WAS VERY PROUD OF HER DAUGHTER AFTER ALL
OH WELL THAT MAKES SENSE THEN SAID THE MANAGER
SO THEY TRIED
A WEEK LATER MAGGIE MANAGED TO ROUND UP TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND AND SEVENTY EIGHT MAGPIE
BUT BEFORE HE FELL ASLEEP HE DID MANAGE TO SAY I BELIEVE ROLLING IS A DECIDEABLE
SAID IT TE WOULD BE BEST TO ASK THE OWL THEN CLOSED HIS EYES HIS EYE
YOUR JOB IS TO BE CUT IS TO BE CUTE SO PEOPLE WANT TO RUN TO THE GIFT SHOP AND BUY PANDA BEAR DOLLS
BAMBOO IS VERY WORKABLE SUB SUBSTANCE AND PANDAS TEND TO HANDLE BAMBOO A LOT A LOT SO THIS IS ITSELF WAS NOT THAT ASTONISHING AT LEAST TO YIN YINS PARENTS
WELL IT SEEMS TO ME SIR THAT YIN YIN WANTED TO BE A GREAT EXPLORER AND INSTEAD BECAME A BUSINESS WOMAN
SO BEFORE HE RAN OFF TO HUG THE PALM TREE QUICKLY QUI TRI TREE QUICKLY SAID ITS COSTS SO MUCH TO FEED Y YOU PANDA BEARS I WOULD HATE IT IF Y IF YOU HAD TO LEAVE US
TURN YOUR HEAD ALL THE WAY AROUND WITHOUT GETTING A TERRIBLE PAIN IN YOUR NECK SAID THE OWL
A LOT OF BAMBOO CAN GET QUITE HEAVY SO BECAUSE OF THE PANDAS FRED BECAME VERY STRONG AND WAS IN TERRIFIC SHAPE
BUT I JUST LEARNED NOW HOW TO MAKE MYSELF INTO A BALL AND ROLL TWO DAYS AGO AND I'M BECOMING VERY GOOD AT IT
HMM HEAVIER THAN I THOUGHT I THINK WE WILL NEED MORE MAGPIES SAID MAGGIE
NO ONE COULD BLAME FRED REALLY SINCE NO ONE REALLY WANTS TO BE EATEN
THIS IS JUST THE TYPE OF EXPOSURE WE NEED THOSE PANDAS WILL BE WITH US FOR A LONG TIME
THIS CAN ALMOST CERTAINLY BE ACCOUNTED FOR BY THE STRANGE ALMOST MAGICAL EFFECT THAT THE PANDAS POSSESS
IT WOULD BE BEST TO FLY
A WEEK LATER DESPITE MUCH FLAPPING THERE WERE STI THEY THEY WERE STILL TRYING AND TO GET THE ROCKET IN THE AIR
THE PANDA
NOW WHILE ALL THIS WAS GOING ON WHAT DO YOU SUPPOSE FRED WAS DOING
SOME PEOPLE DO LIKE TO BITE THEIR FINGER NAILS BUT FRED WASN'T A NAIL BITER SO BEING EATEN WAS DEFINITELY NOT SOMETHING HE LOOKED FORWARD TO EACH AFTERNOON AT THREE O'CLOCK WHEN IT WAS TIME TO FEED THE TIGERS
WELL SIR WHEN COLUMBUS SET
THERE WERE THREE PANDAS AND THEY WERE KNOWN AS THE PAN FAMILY
BUT YIN YIN THE YOUNG PANDA WAS NOT LISTENING TO FRED SHE WAS TALKING TO HER BEST FRIEND MAGGIE THE MAGPIE ABOUT GOING TO THE MOON
THE ZOO MANAGER LAUGHED AND WALKED AWAY BUT DID PURCHASE A FASHIONABLE YELLOW UMBRELLA FOR FRED THE NEXT DAY
FRED FED THE PANDA BEARS THE TIGERS AND TURTLES
FRED WAS NOT ALLOWED TO ACTUALLY HUG THE PANDA BEARS SINCE THAT COULD BE DANGEROUS SO ALL THE OTHER PEOPLE AT THE ZOO WOULD KNOW THAT THE PANDAS HAD JUST BEEN FED WHEN THEY SAW FRED HUGGING THE RATHER UN CUDDLY PALM TREE OUTSIDE OF THE PANDA'S HOME
WHAT IS GOING ON WITH YOUR PANDAS FRED I'VE NEVER SEEN ANYTHING LIKE IT
MAGGIE FIGURED THAT IF HER AND THREE OF THE STRONGEST MAGPIE FRIENDS WERE TO EACH GRAB HOLD OF THE CORNER OF THE ROCKET SHIP THEY COULD ALL FLY TO THE MOON
BUT HE WAS SUPPORTIVE OF HIS YOUNG DAUGHTER AND SHOWED HIS SUPPORT BY TAKING A NAP
WHAT SORT OF NONSENSE IS THIS FOR A YOUNG PAPA FOR A YOUNG PANDA BEAR GOING TO THE MOON INDEED NONSENSE
THE FATHER WATCHING THIS I THIS IS ALL THROUGH ONE EYE FOR HE ALWAYS HAD AT LEAST ONE EYE ASLEEP AT ALL TIMES
SHE WAS SPIT SPITEFUL
YES BUT WHAT DOES THAT HAVE TO DO WITH THE PANDAS NA PANDAS PANDAS MAN SAID THE ZOO MANAGER
FRED WAS STANDING TO STARTING TO FEEL THE UNCOMFORTABLE URGE TO HUG THE PANDA
YIN YIN WAS ALWAYS ONE TO TAKE GOOD ADVICE FROM HER FATHER AND LESS THAN A WEEK LATER YIN YIN AND MAGGIE HAD BUILT A ROCKET SHIP OUT OF BAMBOO
SUCH NONSENSE GOING TO THE MOON SAID HER MOTHER POO POO
MANY PEOPLE KNOW KNOW THAT PANDAS EAT BAMBOO A LOT OF IT
BUT LATER WHEN FRED WALKED INTO THE PANDA'S HOME UNDER HIS NEW
PANDA WOULD LOOK IF PANDAS WERE BIRDS
HE DIDN'T MIND HANDLING THE RAW MEAT HE HAD TO FEED TO THE TIGERS HIS MAIN OBJECT WAS TO BE WAS TO BEING EATEN
I SEE YOUR WINGS FLAPPING BUT WE DON'T SEEM TO BE GOING ANYWHERE SAID YIN YIN
THAT THE ZOO'S PROFITS HAVE GONE UP FOUR THOU FOUR THOUSAND PERCENT
SOLD AT ZOO GIFT SHOPS THEN ALL OF THE OTHER STUFF ANIMALS COMBINED
PULLING WITH ALL THEIR MIGHT
HOW TO TURN
OUT ON HIS SHIP HE WAS REALLY TRYING TO FIND A QUICK QUICKER WAY TO GET AROUND EUROPE IN ORDER TO IMPROVE TRADE
IT'S JUST THAT THERE HAVEN'T BEEN ENOUGH PEOPLE COMING TO SEE YOU IN THE FIRST PLACE
YIN YIN SAID H AND HER BEST FRIEND MAGGIE THE MAGPIE WHO LOOKED A LOT LIKE A PANDA WOULD LOOK IF PANDA
DECIDEALLY ROUND ABOUT WAY TO GO
IT IS INTERESTING TO POINT OUT AT THIS TIME THAT MORE STUFFED PANDA BEARS ARE SOLD
DO YOU KNOW THAT SINCE THE LITTLE PANDA BUILT THAT BAMBOO ROCKETSHIP AND THOSE MAGPIE'S STARTED FLUTTERING ABOUT THAT
ONE TWO THREE TO THE MOON THEY SAID TOGETHER PULLING
SO MAGGIE FLEW TO THE OLD OWL AND ASKED FOR HIS ADVICE
SPITEFULLY
I SEE FRED ONE MORNING ONE MORE THING SIR
AFTER ALL IT'S THE ONLY HOME YOU KNOW BESIDES IF YOU LEAVE I'LL GET TERRIBLY OUT OF SHAPE
FRED WAS IMPRESSED THOUGH
I DON'T THINK IT WILL TAKE THAT LONG TO ROLL THERE SAID YIN YIN
NO HOW MANY MAGPIES WOULD BE NEEDED TO FLY A FOUR HUNDRED POUND PANDA BEAR AND ONE HUNDRED POUND BAMBOO ROCKET SHIP TO THE MOON SAID MAGGIE
YELLOW UMBRELLA ALL SHE COULD THINK OF WAS NONSENSE
HER MOTHER AND H AND FATHER KNEW WHAT THEY WERE TALKING ABOUT SINCE THEY HAD THOUGHT OR TALKED OF SUCH ELSE SINCE YIN YIN SAID I WANT TO GO THERE AND P AND POINTED TO THE MOON
YES BUT HOW MANY MORE YIN YIN SAID
NONSENSE SAID THE MOTHER
FRED THOUGHT ABOUT IT YOU KNOW I THINK WE SHOULD RENAME YIN YIN COLUMBUS
BUT EVERYTHING WAS NOT ALL BAMBOO AND HUGS AT THE ZOO
IT TURNS OUT THAT THE OWL DIDN'T TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION THAT ONCE YOU GET OVER ONE THOUSAND MAGPIE TOGETHER THEY TEND TO FIGHT AND CAN'T AGREE O ON A SINGLE THING
THE ONL THE OTHER REASON WAS THAT ANYONE WHO GETS WITHIN THREE FEET OF A PANDA AUTOMATIC AUTOMATICALLY FALLS IN LOVE WITH THEM
WHY HE WAS FEEDING THE PANDAS LIKE HE WAS SUPPOSED TO
THE ZOO KEEPER SAID GOOD HEAVENS MAN THAT IS A GREAT IDEA
SHE MADE US SHAVE SOMETHING FOR SCIENCE ASK HER SHE SAID THAT WHEN WE SHAVE HAIR IT GROWS BACK BACK HARDER AND SOMETIMES EVEN DARKER
UHM THOSE STUPID GERBILS DIDN'T EVEN THANK ME THEY JUST RAN ON THE STUPID WHEEL AND DIDN'T AND DID STUPID THINGS
YOU WOULDN'T ALWAYS T YOU WOULDN'T ALWAY YOU WOULDN'T ALWAYS TAKE THE CAT'S SIDE IF YOU KNEW THE STUFF TO DO MY POOR HURDLE TO DO MY POOR TURTLE
OH YEAH I FORGOT TO TELL YOU THAT
I DIDN'T SO I DON'T SEE THE BIG DEAL
NOT THAT I SHAVED THE CAT THOUGH NOT THAT I SHAVED THE CAT THOUGH
SO IT REALLY IT'S REALLY MY F IT REALLY FATHER'S DAY GIFT IT'S REALLY MY FATHER'S DAY GIFT TO HIM I COULDN'T BUY HIM ANYTHING NICE SINCE YOU TOOK AWAY MY ALLOWANCE FOR WHEN I SHAVED THE NEIGHBOR'S DOG
PLUS I FORGOT TO TELL YOU THAT I YOU SHOULD BE BLAMING MRS CAT CAPS CASPER MY SCIENCE TEACHER
AND YOU COULD TAKE HER ON TV SHOWS AND LET GET LOTS OF MONEY
P S IF YOU WOULD HAVE BOUGHT HER A TURTLE I COULDN'T HAVE SHAVED IT
I DON'T HAVE TO GET A GOOD I DON'T HAVE TO GET GOOD GRADES TO KNOW THAT YOU SHOULD TEACH A CAT HOW TO SHAVE ITSELF
BUT SO WHAT IF IT'S WINTER I MEAN THE SUMMER IS SOON ENOUGH AND I JUST WANTED TO THE CAT TO GET USED TO THE IDEA BEFORE I GOT REALLY HOT
I WAS AFRAID TO TELL YOU THE REAL REASON I SHAVED THE CAT
I DIDN'T REALLY MEAN TO SHAVE THE CAT REALLY I SWEAR OK HERE'S WHAT HAPPENED AS I REMEMBER IT
I KNOW HOW MUCH YOU HATE HIM ALWAYS SNEEZING AND STUFF SO I
I KNEW OUR CAT WOULD GROW F HER FUR BLACK BACK BUT SOME CATS DIDN'T HAVE HAIR DON'T HAVE HAIR THEY ARE CALLED HAIRLESS CATS
SO CONCLUSION I'M GETTING HUNGRY AND I'M SORRY FOR SHAVING THE CAT ALTHOUGH YOU CAN SEE IT'S REALLY JENNY'S FAULT FOR NOT BEING AS RESPONSIBLE AS YOU ALWAYS SAY SH AND NOT YOU ALWAYS SAY ALWAYS SAY AND NOT BRUSHING HER TEETH
THEN SHE WOULD BE A SUPER CAT
BESIDES THE REAL REASON I SHAVED THE CAT WAS TO KEEP IT NICE AND COOL I JUST DIDN'T WANT TO SEE THE CAT GETTING ALL HOT AND UNCOMFORTABLE AND STUFF
THAT'S JUST MY OPINION THOUGH I I'LL BET YOU DIDN'T EVEN
I REALLY DIDN'T MEAN TO
AND THIS AND THIS AND POOR KITTY THAT IF IT'S YOUR FAULT REALLY DAD PLEASE DON'T READ THE NEXT PART
AND THE CAT WAS BEING CH THE CAT WAS BEING CHASED BY THE TURTLE AND RAN RIGHT BY THE CRIPPLES AND IT SHA CL CLIPPERS AND IT SHAVED SHAVED ITSELF
TURTLES DON'T DO ANYTHING EXCEPT THEIR STICK THEIR POKED STICK THEIR HEADS OUT OF STICK THEIR HEADS OUT AND NOT BE NOT AND BE NOT CUDDLY
SHE'S GOOD AT SCHOOL AND YOU BOUGHT HER A CAT BECAUSE SHE'S SO RESPONSIBLE AND STUFF
FINE OSCAR CAN'T REALLY TALK BUT IF H IF HE COULD HE WOULD HAVE HAD SAID
I WAS AFRAID YOU WOULDN'T LET ME PRACTICE MY OWN ON MY OWN HEAD CAN I
GRABBED DAD'S I GRABBED DAD'S NOSE HAIR CLIPPERS AND SHAVED IT
SO I THOUGHT IF I GOT RID OF ITS FUR HE WOULDN'T SNEEZE
I SWEAR THAT THAT'S THE REASON I ALSO WANT I ALSO WAS GOING TO SELL THE CAT
SHOULD I START ALL OVER OKAY SINCE I HAVE GROUNDED SINCE YOU HAVE GROUNDED ME AND TOLD ME TO WRITE DOWN WHY I AM SORRY BEFORE I WAS ALLOWED OUT OF MY ROOM I AM MAD AT YOU
YOU SHOULDN'T BE PROUD OF ME YOU SHOULDN'T BE PROUD OF ME FOR THINKING SO FAST ON MY TOES
SO I THOUGHT THAT IF I COULD SHAVE THE CAT A BUNCH OF TIMES HER HAIR WOULD GROW BLACK HER HAIR WILL GR GROW BACK HARDER EACH TIME AND SOON SHE WOULD H HAVE AN INVINCIBLE COAT OF CAT FUR ARMOR
THAT THAT'S THE LEAST THAT'S THE LAST TIME I SHAVE THE CAT TO PROTECT ANY STUPID GERBILS
I COULDN'T HELP IT I COULDN'T HELP IT ANYWAY IT WAS AN ACCIDENT AND I DIDN'T EVEN DO IT ON PURPOSE
I THINK THAT SHE SHOULD BRUSH HER TEETH TWICE TONIGHT
CAT'S AREN'T ALWAYS NICE JUST LIKE MY SISTER JENNY ISN'T ALWAYS NICE BUT THE REALEST REASON I SHAVED THE CAT WAS TO MAKE A WIG FOR THOSE POOR HAIRLESS
DEAR MOM AND DAD JENNY DIDN'T BRUSH HER TEETH LAST NIGHT
I DIDN'T IT I DON'T I THINK IT REALLY I THINK IT REALLY LIKED ITS HAIRCUT ONLY THE REASON IT HASN'T COME OUT FOR TWO WEEKS IS BECAUSE YOU GUYS MADE SUCH A BIG DEAL ABOUT IT POOR KITTY
ACTUALLY THE TRUTH IS THAT BUT BY ACCIDENTALLY BY ACCIDENT TURNED THE NOSE HAIR CLIPPERS
HOW COME JENNY GETS A CAT AND I GET A STUPID TURTLE ANYWAY
SINCERELY DANNY
SO THAT SO THAT YOU CAN SEE JENNY TO GO TO COLLEGE AND IT'S IT'S A DUMB LITTLE TATTLE'TALE
PLUS OSCAR MY TURTLE TOLD ME TO SHAVE THE CAT
PLUS IF YOU WEREN'T ALWAYS CUDDLING WITH MY SISTER SO MUCH AS SO MUCH MAYBE YOU WOULD HAVE BEEN WITH HER CAT INSTEAD INSTEAD THE CAT CAME INTO MY ROOM BECAUSE JENNY NEVER PLAYS WITH IT
I SAW THAT THE CAT WAS TRYING TO GET THE GERBILS AND YOU TOLD TOLD US WE COULDN'T HIT THE ANIMALS SO I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT ELSE TO DO SO I
THAT WAS WHY THAT W THAT WAS WHAT THAT WAS THAT I WANTED TO BE A BARBER AND I NEEDED PRACTICE
AND THEY NEED FUR IN IN THE WINTER SOMETIMES I THINK
YOU GUYS WILL PROBABLY JUST SAY IT'S WINTER DAN JUST IT'S JUST WINTER DANNY CATS DON'T OVERHEAT IN WINTER
IF I HAD THE C IF I HAD A IF I HAD A CAT I WOULD TEACH IT NOT TO SHAVE ITSELF THAT'S FOR SURE
I BET I'LL BET YOU DIDN'T KNOW SOMETHING ELSE YOU KNOW THAT I WANTED TO BE A BARBER
I SHAVED THE CAT WAS HE ALWAYS SNEEZING A SNEEZING AROUND IT
DEAR MOM DON'T LET DEAR MOM DON'T LET DAD KNOW THE REAL REASON I SHAVED THE CAT
CAN I GET A DOG PLEASE
JUST CAUSE SHE'S A GOOD STUDENT DOESN'T MEAN THAT SHE REALLY SHE'S REALLY RESPONSIBLE LAST NIGHT I SAW THAT SHE DIDN'T BRUSH HER TEETH
PLEASE SHAVE THE CAT IT'S H ITS KEEPS HITTING ME ON THE SHELL TRYING TO ROLL ME OVER WHEN YOU LEAVE WHEN YOU LEAVE THE ROOM
ENOUGH NEVER PLAYS WITH IT ENOUGH THE CAT LIKED BEING SHAVED ANYWAY SO I DIDN'T SEE THE BIG DEAL
CAN I PRACTICE SHAVING JENNY'S HEAD I PROMISE THAT I'LL DO A BETTER JOB THEN I DID ON THE CAT CAUSE NOW I HAVE DAD DAD NOW I HAVE WHAT DAD CALLS LIFE EXPERIENCE
SELL THE C SELL THE CAT FUR AND BUY MY SISTER JENNY BRACES FOR HER BIG STUPID FACE
AND THEN YOU WOULD HAVE A BETTER MARRIAGE
WOULD I WOULD LIKE TO START BY SAYING I THINK YOU ARE VERY MEAN A VERY MEAN TO ME
YOU GUYS NEVER LIKED OSCAR AS MUCH AS THE CAT ANYWAY
OH SURE IT'S EASY TO SAY THAT I COULD HAVE JUST PICKED THE CAT UP BUT SOMETIMES WE DON'T ALWAYS THINK ALL THE GREAT UNDER PRESSURE YOU AND DO YOU AND DO YOU KNOW WHAT
BUT LATER WHEN FRED WALKED INTO PANDA'S HOME UNDER HIS NEW YELLOW UMBRELLA ALL SHE COULD THINK OF TO SAY WAS NONSENSE
BUT BEFORE HE S FELL ASLEEP HE DID MANAGE TO SAY I BELIEVE ROLLING IS A DECIDEDLY ROLLING ABOUT WAY TO GO IF YOU MUST GO IT IT T'WOULD BE BEST TO FLY
IT'S NOT THAT YOU AREN'T SELLING ENOUGH STUFFED PANDA BEARS IT'S JUST THAT THERE AREN'T
A WEEK LATER DESPITE MUCH FLAPPING THEY WERE ALL TRYING TO GET THE ROCKET INTO THE AIR
HMM HEAVIER THAN I THOUGHT I THINK WE'LL NEED MORE MAGPIES SAID MAGGIE BUT HOW MANY MORE SAID ER YIN YIN SAID I'M NOT EXACTLY SURE REPLIED MAGGIE
THE ZOO KEEPER SAID GOOD HEAVENS MAN THAT'S A GREAT IDEA NO WAIT A SECOND I DON'T UNDERSTAND
IT IS INTERESTING TO POINT OUT THAT ER AT THIS TIME THAT MORE STUFFED PANDA BEARS ARE SOLD AT ZOO GIFT SHOPS THEN ALL OF THE OTHER STUFFED ANIMALS COMBINED
OKAY BUT FRED WAS A NAIL NAIL BITER SO BEING EATEN WAS DEFINITELY NOT SOMETHING HE LOOKED FORWARD TO EACH AFTERNOON AT THREE O'CLOCK WHEN IT CAME TIME TO FEED THE TIGERS
IT'S TAKEN ME A COUPLE WEEKS TO FIGURE IT OUT BUT I I THINK YI YIN YIN WANTS TO GO TO THE MOON AND THE MAGPIES WANT TO TAKE HER THERE
WELL IT SEEMS TO ME SIR THAT YIN YIN WANTS TO BE A GREAT EXPLORER INSTEAD BECAME A BUSINESS WOMAN
BUT EVERYTHING WAS NOT ALL BAMBOOS AND HUGS AT THE ZOO ONE MORNING FRED WAS FEEDING YIN YIN ER YIN YIN AND SAID OH YIN YIN I WISH THAT MORE PEOPLE WOULD COME TO VISIT THE ZOO
NO HOW MANY MAGPIE'S WOULD BE NEEDED TO FLY A FOUR HUNDRED POUND PANDA BEAR AND A ONE HUNDRED POUND BAMBOO ROCKET SHIP TO THE MOON SAID ER YEAH SAID MAGGIE
MANY PEOPLE KNOW THAT PANDAS EAT BAMBOO A LOT OF IT A LOT OF BAMBOO CAN GET QUITE HEAVY SO BECAUSE OF THE PANDAS FRED BECAME VERY STRONG AND WAS IN TERRIFIC SHAPE
THE MAIN OBSTACLE IT IT TURNS OUT WAS GETTING THE ROCKET SHIP OFF THE GROUND
QUICKLY SAID COSTS US SO MUCH TO FEED YOU PANDA BEARS I WOULD HATE IF Y YOU HAD TO LEAVE US AFTER ALL IT'S ONLY HOME YOU KNOW BESIDES IF YOU LEAVE I'LL GET TERRIBLY OUT OF SHAPE NOW IF YOU EXCUSE ME I NEED TO HUG SOME HUG ER SQUEEZE SOMETHING BEFORE I SCREAM
OH WELL THAT MAKES SENSE THEN SAID THE MANAGER
AN INSTANT LATER A YOUNG BOY WAS HEARD SAYING OUCH MOM CUT THAT OUT I'M SORRY TO SAY BUT MANY ER BUT MANY A LITTLE BOY'S CHEEKS HAVE BEEN MADE RAW WHEN MOTHER POO POO PANDA WAS UP UPSET
NOW WHILE ALL THIS WAS GOING ON WHAT DO YOU SUPPOSED FRED WAS DOING WHY HE WAS FEEDING THE PANDAS LIKE HE WAS SUPPOSED TO
TIS WOULD BE BEST TO ASK THE OWL AND THEN CLOSED H HIS EYE
NO ONE COULD BLAME FRED REALLY SINCE NO ONE REALLY WANTS TO BE EAT EATEN
YOUR JOB IS TO BE CUTE SO PEOPLE WANT TO RUN TO THE GIFT SHOP AND BUY PANDA BEAR DR DOLLS IT'S SIMPLE ECONOMICS
ACTUALLY IT WAS A EIGHTY FIVE POINT FIVE DEGREE SPOT ON HIS LEFT KIDNEY BUT THE POINT IS THAT HE WAS VERY FOND OF FEEDING THE PANDAS
YIN YIN WAS ALSO ONE TO TAKE ADVICE FROM FATHER BUT LESS THAN A WEEK LATER YIN YIN AND MAGGIE HAD BUILT A ROCKET SHIP OUT OF BAMBOO BAMBOO IS VERY WORKABLE SUB SUBSTANCE AND PANDAS TEND TO HANDLE BAMBOO A LOT SO THIS IN ITSELF WAS NOT ASTONISHING AT LEAST TO THE YIN YIN ER TO THE YIN YIN'S PARENTS FRED WAS SURE WAS IMPRESSED THOUGH
FRED WAS THE ST STARTING TO FEEL UNCONTROLLABLY URGE TO HUG THE PANDA SO BEFORE HE RAN OFF TO HUG THE PALM TREE QU QU
WHY DID A PANDA WITH A BEAUTIFUL GIRL NAME YIN YANG ER YIN YIN HAVE HER NAME CHANGED TO THE VERY UN BEAUTIFUL NAME COLUMBUS
SOME PEOPLE DO LIKE TO BITE FRED WAS NO OKAY
BACK IN THE PANDA'S HOME THE MOTHER PANDA POO POO WAS VERY PROUD OF HER DAUGHTER
IF WE DON'T GET MORE MONEY
THE OWL INSTANTLY REPLIED TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND AND S SEVENTY SIX GIVE OR TAKE TWO
IT'S A LAW OF NATURE AS AT FURTHER DIS DISTANCES PANDAS HAVE A STRANGE ALMOST MAGICAL EFFECT ON HUMAN BEINGS WHICH MAKES US WANT TO HUG AND SQUEEZE THINGS FRED WAS NOT ALLOWED TO ACT ACTUALLY HUG THE PANDA BEARS SINCE THAT COULD BE DAN DANGEROUS SO ALL THE OTHER PEOPLE IN THE ZOO ER
ONE TWO THREE TO THE MOON THEY SAID TOGETHER PULLING WITH ALL THEIR MIGHT
YES THE BIG ONE IN THE SKY THAT IS MOST LIKELY NOT MADE NOT MADE OF CHEESE AND IS CERTAINLY NOT MADE OF BAMBOO
THIS IS JUST THE TYPE OF EXPOSURE WE NEED THOSE PANDAS WILL BE WITH US FOR A LONG TIME
NONSENSE SAID THE MOTHER I'M SO MAD I'M GOING TO LOOK AT THAT LADY OVER THERE AND MAKE HER WANT TO SQUEEZE HER SON'S CHEEKS SHE SAID SPITEFULLY
AS FOR YIN YIN SHE'S VERY PROUD TO BE RENAMED AFTER A FAMOUS EXPLORER AND SHE AND MAGGIE NEVER STOPPED TRYING TO GET TO THE MOON
IT TURNS OUT THAT THE OWL DIDN'T TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION THAT ONCE YOU GET OVER ONE THOUSAND MAGPIES TOGETHER THEY TEND TO FIGHT AND CAN'T AGREE ON A SINGLE THING
THE FATHER WATCHING ALL THIS THROUGH ONE EYE FOR HE HAD A FOR HE ALWAYS HAD AT LEAST ONE EYE ASLEEP AT ALL TIMES SAID
WELL WHEN COLUMBUS SET OUT ON HIS SHIP HE WAS REALLY TRYING TO FIND A QUICKER WAY TO GET TO GET THROUGH EUROPE IN ORDER TO IMPROVE TRADE
W WOULD LOOK IF PANDAS WERE BIRDS WERE DISCUSSING ABOUT GOING TO THE MOON HER MOTHER AND HER FATHER KNEW THAT WHAT THEY ER WHAT THEY WERE TALKING ABOUT SINCE THEY HADN'T THOUGHT OR TALKED OF MUCH ELSE SINCE YIN YIN SAID I WANT TO GO THERE AND POINTED TO THE MOON
ENOUGH OF THIS NONSENSE SAID YIN YIN'S MOTHER POO POO WHAT SORT OF NONSENSE IS THIS FOR A YOUNG PANDA BEAR GO TO THE MOON INDEED NONSENSE
HE DIDN'T MIND HANDLING THE RAW MEAT HE HAD TO FEED THE TO THE TIGERS HIS MAIN OBJECTION WAS TO BEING EATEN
THIS MUST CERTAINLY BE
FOR FRED WHEN IT CAME TO THE PANDAS HE HAD A WARM SPOT IN HIS HEART
TH THAT THERE HAVEN'T BEEN ENOUGH PEOPLE COMING TO SEE YOU IN THE FIRST PLACE I THINK WHAT THE ZOO NEEDS IS A GREAT ADVERTISING CAMPAIGN
THE PANDA
I SEE FRED ONE MORE THING SIR ABOUT THESE MAGPIES FLYING ABOVE THE PANDAS DO YOU THINK THAT THE ZOO COULD PURCHASE ME A LARGE SIZED UMBRELLA
BUT I JUST LEARNED HOW TO MAKE MYSELF INTO A BALL AND ROLL TWO DAYS AGO AND I'VE B I'M BECOMING VERY GOOD AT IT I DON'T THINK IT WILL TAKE THAT LONG TO ROLL THERE SAID YIN YIN
SOME PEOPLE DO LIKE TO BITE THEIR F ER
THE ZOO MANAGER LAUGHED AND WALKED AWAY BUT DID NOT PUR PURCHASE A FASHIONABLE YELLOW UMBRELLA FOR FRED THE NEXT DAY
I KNEW I SHOULDN'T BE TELLING YOU THIS BUT IT BUT WE MUST HAVE TO SELL YOU AND YOUR FAMILY TO THE BIG ZOO IN S SAN ANGELES
MAGGIE FIGURED OUT THAT IF HER AND H THREE OF HER STRONGEST MAGPIE FRIENDS WERE TO EACH GRAB HOLD OF A CORNER OF THE ROCKET SHIP THEY COULD ALL FLY TO THE MOON SO THEY TRIED
BUT PHYSICAL FITNESS WAS NOT THE ONLY REASON FRED LOVED THE PANDAS THE OTHER REASON WAS THAT ANYONE WHO GETS WITHIN THREE FEET OF A PANDA PANDA AUTOMATICALLY FALLS IN LOVE WITH THEM
DO YOU KNOW THAT SINCE THE LITTLE PANDA BUILT THE BAMBOO ROCKET SHIP AND THOSE AND THOSE MAGPIE'S STARTED FLUTTERING ABOUT THAT THE ZOO'S PROFIT HAVE GONE GONE UP FOUR THOUSAND PERCENT
BUT YIN YIN THE P YOUNG PANDA WAS NOT LISTENING TO FRED SHE WAS TALKING TO HER BEST FRIEND MAGGIE THE MAGPIE ABOUT GOING TO THE MOON
SO ONE DAY AFTER FRED HAD FE FEED FED THE PANDAS AND WAS HUGGING THE PALM TREE THE ZOO MANAGER CAME UP TO HIM AND SAID WHAT IS GOING ON WITH YOUR PANDAS FRED I'VE NEVER SEEN ANYTHING LIKE IT
SO MAGGIE FLEW OFF TO THE OWL AND ASKED FOR H HIS ADVICE OH WISE OWL I HAVE A QUESTION THAT I FEAR ONLY YOU CAN ANSWER HOW SHE SAID
YES BUT WHAT DOES THAT HAVE TO DO WITH PANDAS MAN
LIKE IT OR NOT WE ARE SPOKESPEOPLE FOR THE PANDA STUFFED ANIMAL INDUSTRY WHICH YOUNG LADY HELPS PAY FOR THE BAMBOO THAT YOU EAT SUCH NONSENSE GOING TO THE MOON SAID HER MOTHER P POO POO BUT
SOME PEOPLE DO LIKE THE TO BITE THEIR FINGER NAILS BUT SINCE NO ONE REALLY WANTS TO BE EATEN
HOW TO TURN YOUR HEAD ALL THE WAY AROUND WITHOUT GETTING A TERRIBLE PAIN IN YOUR NECK SAID THE SAID OWL
THIS ALMOST CERTAINLY BE ACCOUNTED FOR BY THIS STRANGE ALMOST MAGICAL EFFECT THAT PANDAS POSSESS
THERE WERE THREE PANDAS AND THEY WERE KNOWN AS THE PAN FAMILY THEY WERE IN ORDERS OF CUTENESS YIN YIN THE DAUGHTER OF POO POO THE MOTHER AND MOO MAN THE GENTLE AND ALWAYS SLEEPY FATHER
IT WAS FRED'S IDEA SO LET'S BEGIN WITH FRED
THE ZOO WOULD KNOW THAT THE PANDAS HAD JUST BEEN FED WHEN THEY SAW FRED HUGGING THE RATHER UN CUDDLY PALM TREE OUTSIDE OF THE PANDA'S HOME
YIN YIN'S FATHER MOO MAN DIDN'T THINK IT WAS VERY PROPER OR WISE FOR A YOUNG PANDA BEAR TO GO ROLLING OFF PLACES WHERE THERE WASN'T ANY BAMBOO BUT HE WAS SUPPORTIVE OF THIS H OF HIS YOUNG DAUGHTER AND SHOWING HIS SUPPORT BY TAKING A NAP
AFTER ALL IF IT WEREN'T FOR YIN YIN THEY WOULDN'T HAVE THEY WOULD HAVE HAD TO MOVE FROM THEIR WONDERFUL HOME
A WEEK LATER MAGGIE MANAGED TO ROUND UP TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND AND SEVENTY EIGHT MAGPIE SHE COULD BE VERY PERSUASIVE LITTLE BIRD WHEN SHE WANTED
I SEE YOUR WINGS FLAPPING BUT WE DON'T SEEM TO BE GOING ANYWHERE SAID YIN YIN
FRED THOUGHT ABOUT IT AND SAID YOU KNOW I THINK WE SHOULD RENAME YIN YIN COLUMBUS
YIN YIN AND HER BEST FRIEND MAGGIE THE MAGPIE WHO ARE LOOKING WHO LOOKED A LOT LIKE A PANDA WOULD LOOK
MANOR
BRUCE OKAY BRUCE OFTEN HELPED PEOPLE
THEN THEY SNATCHED HER PURSE AND RAN
PARTNER IN CRIME

WAYNE MY
HIS COSTUME WAS COVERED WITH A FIRE BOLT COATING THE FLAME BALL HIT HIM HIM FULL BLAST BUT BATMAN WAS PROTECTED
BEGIN PHASE TWO
DICK LIVED IN THE MANSION BUT WONDERED WHERE BRUCE WENT EVERY EVENING
WITH THE LAST OUNCE OF STRENGTH BATMAN GRABBED THE HAND
SHE SAID THAT SHE HAD TO HELP OTHER PASSENGERS
THE PILOT TOLD ME THERE THAT HE WASN'T REALLY THAT IT WASN'T REALLY THAT HARD ONCE YOU PRACTICED
BUT IT WASN'T PEANUTS IT WAS SOMETHING REALLY COOL
IT SEEMS LIKE THE PLANE WAS GOING SO FAST TO EVER STOP BUT IT SEEMS LIKE THE PLANES GOING TOO FAST TO EVER STOP BUT IT DOES
IT WAS THE PEANUTS THAT WERE MAKING ME SO THIRSTY IN THE FIRST PLACE
I WAS FLYING THERE TO SEE MY GRANDFATHER AND WE WERE GOING TO GO FISHING
I HAD A GAME BOY IN MY BACKPACK MY BACKPACK WAS THE O WAS IN THE OVERHEAD THINGY
I COL THE O I ONLY USED THE GREEN CRAYON BECAUSE IT WAS THE TALLEST AND I WANTED IT TO CATCH UP T TO THE RED BLUE YELLOW AND PURPLE AND BLACK ONES
I I TRIED TO WATCH THE MOVIE BUT I HAD ALREADY SEEN
I STARTED THINKING WE MIGHT CRASH I DIDN'T LIKE TO THINK ABOUT THAT BUT I COULDN'T HELP IT
THERE'S NO WAY I A THERE'S NO WAY ANYONE CAN REMEMBER TO PUSH ALL THOSE BUTTONS AT THE RIGHTS TIME WE ARE GOING TO CRASH
SHE DIDN'T LIKE CALLED BE SHE DIDN'T LIKE BEING CALLED PEANUT LADY BUT SHE DID GET MY GAME BOY
THE PERSON NEXT TO ME WOULD HAVE BEEN VERY ANNOYED
HE LAUGHED EVEN THOUGH IT WASN'T JOKING JOKING
HOW WAS YOUR FLIGHT I SAID SOMEDAY I'M GOING TO BE A PILOT AND I'M ONLY SERVE BANANA SPLITS ON MY PLANE
OR IF SHE WOULD GET ME A BANANA SPLIT I WOULDN'T HAVE TO GO THE BATHROOM SO MUCH
BUT TO TELL YOU THE T BUT TO TELL THE TRUTH WITHOUT MY PARENTS THERE I WAS PRETTY NERVOUS
JENNIFER TOOK ME TO THE COCKPIT AND THERE WAS WHERE THERE WAS A MILLION BUTTONS AND LEVERS AND KNOBS AND STUFF
BUT GUESS WHAT I WAS TOO SHORT TO S UHM REACH THE BUTTON
I HAD SEVEN COLAS AND FOUR GINGER ALES WHICH MADE ME HAD TO GO TO THE BATHROOM EIGHT TIMES
THAT HE ONCE PLAYED THE GAME I HAD ON MY GAME BOY BUT HE COULDN'T EVEN PASS LEVEL ONE
THE FIRST TIME I EVER TOOK AN AIRPLANE BY MYSELF IT WAS FUN AND SCARY
MY MOM GAVE ME A COLORING BOOK A OF COOL LOOKING DRAGON TO KEEP ME BUSY
THAT ONE WAS SO B I HAD ALREADY SEEN THAT ONE SO IT WAS BORING
BUT ONCE THE PLANE WAS IN THE AIR I WAS PRETTY GOOD
THAT'S THE WAY I FIGURED IT MY MY GAME MY GAME BOY ONLY HAS FIVE BUTTONS AND I CAN'T G B GET PAST LEVEL THREE
I PLAYED ON MY GAME BOY UNTIL I GOT TO NEW UNTIL I GOT A NEW HIGH SCORE THEN JENNIFER CAME THEN J JENNIFER CAME UP TO ME AND SAID SHE WAS SHE HAD A SURPRISE
BUT IT WAS HER FAULT SHE WAS THE ONE WHO KEPT TRYING TO GIVE ME PEANUTS
HE WAS REALLY NICE BUT HE BUT HE WOULDN'T PLAY GO FISH WITH ME
THEN HE TOLD ME THAT HE ONCE PLAYED A GAME BOY
SHE SAID THE CAPTAIN WAS INVITING ME TO THE COCKPIT
WHEN I GET OFF THE AIRPLANE THERE WAS GRANDPA WAITING FOR ME HE SAID
SO THAT IF SHE WOULD GET ME A BA SO IF SHE WOULDN'T BANANA SPLIT I WOULDN'T HAVE TO GO THE BATHROOM SO MUCH
I THOUGHT AWESOME HE ALSO I ALSO BROUGHT MY DECK OF CARDS IN CASE THE PILOT WAS BORED AND WANTED TO PLAY GO FISH
I'VE ALWAYS THOUGHT FLYING WAS FUN YOU GO HIGHER TH THAN ANY MOUNTAIN AND GO FASTER THAN ANY CAR
I TRIED TO PUSH THE BUTTON THAT LIGHTS UP I TRIED TO PUSH THE BUTTON THAT LIGHTS OVER UP OVER MY HEAD SO THE FLIGHT ATTENDANT WOULD COME
ONE THING ABOUT BEING BY YOURSELF ON AN AIRPLANE IS THAT THE FLIGHT ATTENDANTS ARE VERY NICE TO YOU
THE W THAT WAY I FIGURED IT OUT
THAT'S WHEN THAT'S WHEN I MISSED THE P MY PARENTS THE MOST
SHE TOLD ME TO CALL HER JENNIFER INSTEAD
HE SAID THAT I WOULD MAKE A UHM VERY GOOD PILOT SOMEDAY IF I WANTED TO BE
EVENTUALLY THE FLIGHT ATTENDANT SEEMED TO GO GET A LITTLE ANNOYED THAT I HAD TO GO TO THE BATHROOM SO MUCH
GRANDPA LAUGHED AND TOOK ME STRAIGHT TO THE ICE CREAM SHOP
SHE TOLD ME TO BE QUIET AND WATCH THE MOVIE
IT WAS WORTH THE WHOLE TRIP JUST TO EAT A BANANA SPLIT WITH GRANDPA
AT FIRST I THOUGHT WOW LOOK AT ALL THOSE BUTTONS THEN I THOUGHT
I GUESS IT WAS BECAUSE THE PLANE WAS SO LOUD AND I DIDN'T KNOW ANYONE
SO I STARTED YELLING HEY PEANUT LADY HEY PEANUT LADY
I SAID IF YOU CAN'T GET EVEN PAST LEVEL ONE THEN AND YOU'RE A PILOT THEN I COULD BE A PILOT TOO SINCE I'M MUCH BETTER AT PUSHING BUTTONS THAN YOU ARE
I WAS GLAD THAT THERE WASN'T ANYBODY NEXT TO ME
I DIDN'T KNOW ANYONE AT ALL AND I HAD TO GO ALL THE WAY FROM NEW YORK TO TEXAS WITHOUT MY PARENTS
I COLORED THE DRAGON PICTURES ALL GREEN SO IT DIDN'T TAKE VERY LONG
THE FLIGHT ATTENDANT GAVE ME A DECK OF CARDS BUT SHE WOULDN'T PLAY GO FISH WITH ME
IMAGINE HOW HARD IT WOULD TO BE WORK THOSE MILLIONS OF BUTTONS AND EAT PEANUTS
I THOUGHT GREAT MORE PEANUTS
FINALLY WE LANDED THAT WAS SCARY
I TOLD HER THAT I WANTED A BANANA SPLIT INSTEAD SHE INSTEAD BUT SHE SAID WE DON'T HAVE BANANA SPLITS ON A PLANE
HOW TO TURN YOUR HEAD ALL THE WAY AROUND WITHOUT GETTING A TERRIBLE PAIN IN YOUR NECK SAID THE OWL
YIN YIN AND HER BEST FRIEND MAGGIE THE MAGPIE WHO LOOKED A LOT LIKE A PANDA WOULD LOOK IF A PANDA IF PANDAS WERE BIRDS
YES BUT WHAT DOES THAT HAVE TO DO WITH THE PANDAS MAN SAID THE ZOO MANAGER
I'M SORRY TO SAY BUT MANY A LITTLE BOY'S CHEEKS HAVE BEEN MADE RAW WHEN MOTHER POO POO WAS UPSET
WHAT IS GOING ON WITH YOUR PANDAS FRED I'VE NEVER SEEN ANYTHING LIKE IT
I KNOW I SHOULDN'T BE TELLING YOU THIS BUT WE MIGHT HAVE TO SELL YOU AND YOUR FAMILY TO THE BIG ZOO IN SAN ANGELES IF WE DON'T GET MORE MONEY
AND THREE OF HER STRONGEST MAGPIE FRIENDS WERE TO GRAB HOLD OF A CORNER OF THE ROCKET SHIP THEY COULD ALL FLY TO THE MOON
IT'S NOT THAT YOU AREN'T SELLING ENOUGH STUFFED PANDA BEARS IT'S JUST THAT THERE HAVEN'T BEEN ENOUGH PEOPLE COMING TO SEE YOU IN THE FIRST PLACE
THEY WERE IN ORDER OF CUTENESS YIN YIN THE YOUNG DAUGHTER POO POO THE MOTHER AND MOO MAN THE THE GENTLE AND ALWAYS SLEEPY FATHER
IT WAS FRED'S IDEA SO LET'S BEGIN WITH FRED
A WEEK LATER THEY WERE STILL TRYING AND TO GET THE ROCKET INTO THE AIR
THE ZOO MANAGER LAUGHED AND WALKED AWAY BUT DID PURCHASE A FASHIONABLE YELLOW UMBRELLA FOR FRED THE NEXT DAY
THIS IS JUST THE TYPE OF EXPOSURE WE NEED THOSE PANDAS WILL BE WITH US FOR A LONG TIME
YES BUT HOW MANY MORE YIN YIN SAID I'M NOT SURE EXACTLY REPLIED MAGGIE
THE FATHER WATCHING THIS ALL THROUGH ONE EYE FOR HE ALWAYS HAD AT LEAST ONE EYE ASLEEP AT ALL TIMES
AFTER ALL IT'S THE ONLY HOME YOU KNOW BESIDES IF YOU WOULD LEAVE I'LL GET TERRIBLY OUT OF SHAPE
THE OTHER REASON WAS THAT ANYONE WHO GETS WITHIN THREE FEET OF A PANDA AUTOMATICALLY FALLS IN LOVE WITH THEM
IT WOULD BE BEST TO FLY
SOME PEOPLE DO LIKE TO BITE THEIR FINGER NAILS BUT FRED WASN'T A NAIL BITER SO BEING EATEN WAS DEFINITELY NOT SOMETHING HE LOOKED FORWARD TO EACH AFTERNOON AT THREE O'CLOCK WHEN IT WAS TIME TO FEED THE TIGERS
IT'S SIMPLE ECONOMICS LIKE IT OR NOT WE ARE SPOKESPEOPLE FOR THE PANDA STUFFED ANIMAL INDUSTRY WHICH YOUNG LADY HELPS PAY FOR THE BAMBOO THAT YOU EAT
THIS CAN ALMOST CERTAINLY BE ACCOUNTED FOR BY THE STRANGE ALMOST MAGICAL EFFECT THAT THE PANDAS POSSESS
AT LEAST TO YIN YINS PARENTS FRED WAS SURE IMPRESSED THOUGH
THE OWL INSTANTLY REPLIED TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND AND SEVENTY SIX GIVE OR TAKE TWO
I SEE FRED
YIN YIN WAS ALWAYS ONE TO TAKE GOOD ADVICE FROM HER FATHER
OH WELL THAT MAKES SENSE THEN SAID THE MANAGER
BUT HE WAS SUPPORTIVE OF HIS YOUNG DAUGHTER AND SHOWED HIS SUPPORT BY TAKING A NAP
I SEE YOUR WINGS FLAPPING BUT WE DON'T SEEM TO BE GOING ANYWHERE SAID YIN YIN
FRED WAS STARTING TO FEEL THE UNCONTROLLABLE URGE TO HUG THE PANDA
A LOT OF BAMBOO CAN GET QUITE HEAVY SO BECAUSE OF THE PANDAS FRED BECAME VERY STRONG AND WAS IN TERRIFIC SHAPE
BUT BEFORE HE FELL TO SLEEP HE DID MANAGE TO SAY I BELIEVE ROLLING IS A DECIDEDLY ROUND ABOUT WAY TO GO IF YOU MUST GO
HE DIDN'T MIND HANDLING THE RAW MEAT HE HAD TO FEED TO THE TIGERS HIS MAIN OBJECTION WAS BEING EATEN
ENOUGH OF THIS NONSENSE SAID YIN YIN'S MOTHER POO POO WHAT SORT OF NONSENSE IS THIS FOR A YOUNG PANDA BEAR GO TO THE MOON INDEED
BUT THE POINT IS HE WAS VERY FOND OF FEEDING THE PANDAS
THE PANDA
AS FOR YIN YIN SHE WAS VERY PROUD TO BE RENAMED AFTER A FAMOUS EXPLORER AND SHE AND MAGGIE NEVER STOPPED TRYING TO GET TO THE MOON
AFTER ALL IF IT WEREN'T FOR YIN YIN THEY WOULD HAVE TO MOVE FROM THEIR WONDERFUL HOME
THE ZOO KEEPER SAID GOOD HEAVENS MAN THAT IS A GREAT IDEA NO WAIT A SECOND I DON'T UNDERSTAND
SO MAGGIE FLEW TO THE OWL AND ASKED FOR HIS ADVICE
BUT YIN YIN THE YOUNG PANDA WAS NOT LISTENING TO FRED SHE WAS TALKING TO HER BEST FRIEND MAGGIE THE MAGPIE ABOUT GOING TO THE MOON
WELL SIR WHEN COLUMBUS SET OUT ON HIS SHIP HE WAS REALLY TRYING TO FIND A QUICKER WAY TO GET TO GET AROUND EUROPE IN ORDER TO IMPROVE IMPROVE TRADE
FRED WAS NOT ALLOWED TO ACTUALLY HUG THE PANDA BEARS SINCE THAT COULD BE DANGEROUS
NONSENSE SAID HER MOTHER I'M SO MAD I'M GOING TO LOOK AT THAT LADY OVER THERE AND MAKE HER WANT TO SQUEEZE HER SONS CHEEKS SHE SAID SPITEFULLY
WHY HE WAS FEEDING THE PANDAS LIKE HE WAS SUPPOSED TO
ACTUALLY IT WAS AN EIGHTY FIVE POINT FIVE DEGREE SPOT IN HIS LEFT KIDNEY
BUT I JUST LEARNED HOW TO MAKE MYSELF INTO A BALL AND ROLL TWO DAYS AGO AND I'VE BECOMING VERY GOOD AT IT
BUT EVERYTHING WAS NOT ALL BAMBOO AND HUGS AT THE ZOO
MAGGIE FIGURED THAT IF SHE AND
WERE DISCUSSING ABOUT GOING TO THE MOON
NO HOW MANY MAGPIES WOULD BE NEEDED TO FLY A FOUR HUNDRED POUND PANDA BEAR AND A ONE HUNDRED POUND BAMBOO ROCKET SHIP TO THE MOON
WELL IT SEEMS TO ME SIR THAT YIN YIN WANTED TO BE A GREAT EXPLORER AND INSTEAD BECAME A BUSINESS WOMAN
PA YIN YIN'S FATHER MOO MAN DIDN'T THINK IT WAS VERY PROPER OR WISE FOR A YOUNG PANDA BEAR TO GO ROLLING OFF TO PLACES WHERE THERE WASN'T ANY BAMBOO
IT'S TAKEN ME A COUPLE OF WEEKS TO FIGURE OUT WHAT I THINK YIN YIN WANTS TO GO TO THE MOON AND WHAT AND THE MAGPIES WANT TO TAKE HER THERE
SO THEY TRIED ONE TWO THREE TO THE MOON THEY SAID TOGETHER PULLING IT WITH ALL THEIR MIGHT
I THINK WHAT THE ZOO NEEDS IS GREAT ADVERTISING CAMPAIGN
MANY PEOPLE KNEW THAT PANDAS EAT BAMBOO A LOT OF IT
HER MOTHER AND FATHER KNEW WHAT THEY WERE TALKING ABOUT SINCE THEY HADN'T THOUGHT OR TALKED OF MUCH ELSE SINCE YIN YIN SAID I WANT TO GO THERE AND POINTED TO THE MOON
FRED FED THE PANDA BEARS THE TIGERS AND TURTLES THE TURTLES WEREN'T SO BAD BUT AS FOR THE TIGERS TIGERS HE WASN'T SO SURE
THAT MORE SUFFERED PANDA BEARS ARE SOLD AT ZOO GIFT SHOPS
IT TURNS OUT THAT THE OWL DIDN'T TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION THAT ONCE YOU NEVER ONCE YOU GOT OVER ONE THOUSAND MAGPIE TOGETHER THEY TEND TO FLIGHT AND CAN'T AGREE ON A SINGLE THING
BACK IN THE PANDA'S HOME THE MOTHER PANDA POO POO WAS VERY PROUD OF HER DAUGHTER
FRED THOUGHT ABOUT IT AND SAID YOU KNOW WHAT I THINK WE SHOULD N RENAME YIN YIN COLUMBUS
NOW IF YOU EXCUSE ME I NEED TO SQUEEZE SOMETHING BEFORE I SCREAM
SAID IT T'WOULD BE BEST TO ASK THE OWL THEN CLOSED HIS EYE
IT'S A LAW OF NATURE AT FURTHER DISTANCES PANDAS HAVE A STRANGE ALMOST MAGICAL EFFECT ON HUMAN BEINGS WHICH MAKES US WANT TO HUG AND SQUEEZE THINGS
SUCH NONSENSE GOING TO THE MOON SAID HER MOTHER POO POO
FOR FRED WHEN IT CAME TO THE PANDAS HE HAD A WARM SPOT IN HIS HEART
NOW WHILE ALL THIS WAS GOING ON WHAT DO YOU SUPPOSED FRED WAS DOING
THE MAIN OBSTACLE IT TURNS OUT WAS GETTING THE ROCKET SHIP OFF THE GROUND
A WEEK LATER MAGGIE MANAGED TO ROUND UP TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND SEVENTY EIGHT MAGPIE SHE COULD BE A VERY PERSUASIVE LITTLE BIRD WHEN SHE WANTED
A LESS THAN WEEK LATER YIN YIN AND MAGGIE HAD BUILT A ROCKET SHIP OUT OF BAMBOO
ONE MORE THING SIR ABOUT THOSE MAGPIES FLYING ABOVE THE PANDAS DO YOU THINK THAT THE ZOO COULD PURCHASE ME A LARGE SIZED UMBRELLA
DID YOU KNOW THAT SINCE THE LITTLE PANDA BUILT THE BAMBOO ROCKET SHIP AND THOSE MAGPIE'S STARTED FLUTTERING ABOUT THAT THE ZOO'S PROFITS HAVE GONE UP FOUR THOUSAND PERCENT
HMM HEAVIER THAN I THOUGHT I THINK WE WILL NEED MORE MAGPIES SAID MAGGIE
SO BEFORE HE RAN OFF TO HUG THE PALM TREE QUICKLY SAID IT COSTS SO MUCH TO FEED YOU PANDA BEARS I WOULD HATE IF YOU HAD TO LEAVE US
BUT PHYSICAL FITNESS WAS NOT THE ONLY REASON THAT FRED LOVED THE PANDAS
NONSENSE YOUR JOB IS TO BE CUTE SO PEOPLE WILL TO RUN TO THE GIFT SHOP AND BUY PANDA BEAR DOLLS
NO ONE COULD B BLAME FRED REALLY SINCE NO ONE REALLY WANTS TO BE EATEN
BAMBOO IS VERY WORKABLE SUBSTANCE AND PANDAS TEND TO HANDLE BAMBOO A LOT SO THIS IN ITSELF WAS NOT THAT ASTONISHING
THEN ALL OF THE OTHER STUFF COMBINED
THERE WERE THREE PANDAS AND THEY WERE KNOWN AS THE PAN FAMILY
WHY DID A PANDA WITH THE BEAUTIFUL GIRL NAME YIN YIN HAVE HER NAME CHANGED TO THE VERY UN BEAUTIFUL GIRL NAME COLUMBUS
IT IS I IT IS INTERESTING TO POINT OUT THIS AT A TIME
BUT LATER WHEN FRED WAS WALKED INTO THE PANDA'S HOME UNDER HIS NEW YELLOW UMBRELLA ALL COULD SHE ALL THI SHE COULD THINK TO SAY WAS NONSENSE
YES THE BIG ONE IN THE SKY THAT IS MOST LIKELY NOT MADE OF CHEESE AND MOST CERTAINLY NOT MADE OF BAMBOO
OH WISE OWL I HAVE A QUESTION THAT I FEAR ONLY YOU CAN ANSWER SHE SAID
AN INSTANT LATER A YOUNG BOY WAS HEARD SAYING OUCH MOM CUT THAT OUT
HE WANTED TO BE A BUSINESS MAN INSTEAD OF AND BUT INSTEAD BECAME A GREAT EXPLORER
SO ALL THE OTHER PEOPLE AT THE ZOO WOULD KNOW THAT THE PANDAS HAD JUST BEEN FED WHEN THEY SAW FRED HUGGING THE RATHER UN CUDDLY PALM TREE OUTSIDE OF THE PANDA'S PANDA'S HOME
I DON'T THINK IT WILL TAKE THAT LONG TO ROLL THERE SAID YIN YIN
SO ONE DAY AFTER FRED HAD FED THE PANDAS AND WAS HUGGING THE PALM TREE THE ZOO MANAGER CAME UP TO HIM AND SAID
ONE MORNING WHEN FRED WAS FEEDING YIN YIN AND SAID OH YIN YIN I WISH THAT MORE PEOPLE WOULD COME AND VISIT THE ZOO
HE WAS REALLY NICE BUT HE WOULDN'T PLAY GO FISH WITH ME
I TOLD HER THAT IT WAS THE PEANUTS THAT WERE MAKING ME SO THIRSTY IN THE FIRST PLACE AND THAT IF SHE COULD GET ME A BANANA SPLIT IT WOULD I WOULDN'T HAVE TO GO THE BATHROOM SO MUCH
FINALLY WE LANDED THAT THAT'S ALWAYS SCARY IT SEEMS LIKE THE PLANE IS GOING TOO FAST TO EVEN STOP BUT IT DOES
JENNIFER TOOK ME INTO THE COCKPIT AND THERE WERE A MILLION BUTTONS AND LEVERS AND KNOBS AND STUFF
I'VE ALWAYS THOUGHT FLYING WAS FUN YOU GO HIGHER THAN ANY MOUNTAIN AND YOU GO FASTER THAN ANY CAR BUT TO TELL YOU THE TRUTH WITH WITHOUT MY PARENTS THERE I WAS PRETTY NERVOUS
I HAD A GAME BOY IN MY BACKPACK MY BACKPACK WAS IN THE IN THE OVERHEAD THINGY
ONE THING ABOUT BEING BEING BY YOURSELF ON AN AIRPLANE IS THAT THE FLIGHT ATTENDANTS ARE VERY NICE TO YOU
THE FLIGHT ATTENDANT GAVE ME A DECK OF CARDS BUT SHE WOULDN'T PLAY GO FISH WITH ME SHE SAID SHE HAD TO HELP OTHER PASSENGERS
GRANDPA LAUGH LAUGHED AND TOOK ME STRAIGHT TO THE ICE CREAM SHOP I WAS WORTH THE WHOLE TRIP JUST TO EAT A BANANA SPLIT WITH GRANDPA
MY MOM GAVE ME A COLORING BOOK OF COOL LOOKING DRAGONS TO KEEP ME BUSY I COLORED THE DRAGON PICTURES ALL GREEN SO IT DIDN'T TAKE VERY LONG
EVENTUALLY THE FLIGHT ATTENDANT SEEMED TO GET A LITTLE ANNOYED THAT I HAD TO GO TO THE BATHROOM SO MUCH BUT IT WAS HER FAULT
THE FIRST TIME I EVER TOOK AN AIRPLANE BY MYSELF IT WAS A FUN AND SCARY
SHE DIDN'T LIKE BEING CALLED PEANUT LADY BUT SHE DID GET MY GAME BOY SHE TOLD ME TO CALL HER JENNIFER INSTEAD
I S I SAID IF YOU CAN'T EVEN GET PAST LEVEL ONE THEN YOU'RE A PILOT AND YOU'RE A PILOT THEN I COULD BE A PILOT T TOO SINCE I'M MUCH BETTER AT PUSHING BUTTONS THAN YOU ARE
I WAS GLAD THAT THERE WASN'T ANYONE NEXT TO ME THE PERSON NEXT TO ME WOULD HAVE BEEN VERY ANNOYED
SHE TOLD ME TO BE QUIET AND WATCH THE MOVIE I TRIED TO WATCH THE MOVIE BUT I HAD ALREADY ALREADY SEEN THAT ONE SO SO IT WAS BORING
AT THE FIRST AT FIRST I THOUGHT WOW LOOK AT ALL THOSE BUTTONS THEN I THOUGHT THERE'S NO WAY THAT ANYONE CAN REMEMBER TO PUSH ALL THOSE BUTTONS AT THE RIGHT TIME WE ARE GOING TO CRASH
I GUESS IT WAS BECAUSE THE PLANE WAS SO LOUD AND I DIDN'T KNOW ANYONE I STARTED TO THINK WE MIGHT CRASH I DIDN'T LIKE TO THINK ABOUT THAT BUT I COULDN'T HELP IT THAT'S WHEN I MISSED MY PARENTS THE MOST BUT ONCE THE PLANE WAS IN THE AIR I WAS PRETTY GOOD
I TRIED TO PUSH THE BUTTON THAT LIGHTS UP OVER MY HEAD SO THE FLIGHT ATTENDANT WOULD COME BUT GUESS WHAT I WAS TOO SHORT TO REACH THE BUTTON SO I STARTED YELLING HEY PEANUT LADY HEY PEANUT LADY
THE PILOT TOLD ME THAT IT WASN'T REALLY THAT HARD ONCE YOU PRACTICED THEN HE TOLD ME THAT HE ONCE PLAYED THE GAME I HAD ON MY GAME BOY AND HE COULDN'T EVEN PASS ONE LEVEL ONE
I HAD SEVEN COLA'S AND FOUR GINGER ALE'S WHICH MADE ME HAVE TO GO TO THE BATHROOM EIGHT TIMES
THE WAY I FIGURED IT MY GAME MY GAME BOY ONLY HAS FIVE BUTTONS AND I CAN'T GET PAST LEVEL THREE IMAGINE HOW HARD IT WOULD BE TO WORK ALL THOSE MILLIONS OF BUTTONS AND EAT PEANUTS
I ONLY USED THE GREEN CRAYON BECAUSE IT WAS THE TALLEST AND I WANTED TO KEEP WANTED IT TO CATCH UP TO THE RED BROWN BLUE YELLOW PURPLE AND BLACK ONES
SHE WAS THE ONE THAT KEPT TRYING TO GIVE ME PEANUTS I TOLD HER THAT I WANTED A BANANA SPLIT INSTEAD BUT SHE SAID THEY DON'T HAVE ANY BANANA SPLITS ON THE PLANE BUT SOMETIMES PEOPLE LIKE TO EAT PEANUTS ON THEIR BANANA SPLITS I
SHE SAID THE CAPTAIN WAS INVITING INVITING ME TO SEE THE COCKPIT COCKPIT I THOUGHT I THOUGHT AWESOME I ALSO BOUGHT BROUGHT MY DECK OF CARDS IN THE CASE IN CASE OF THE PILOT WAS BORED AND WANTED WANTED TO PLAY GO FISH
I DIDN'T KNOW ANYONE AT ALL AND HAD TO GO ALL THE WAY FROM NEW YORK TO TEXAS WITHOUT MY PARENTS I WAS FLYING THERE TO SEE MY GRANDFATHER AND WE WERE GOING TO GO FISHING
I PLAYED MY GAME BOY UNTIL I GOT MY NEW HIGH SCORE THEN JEN THEN JENNIFER CAME UP TO ME AND SAID SHE HAD A SURPRISE I THOUGHT GREAT MORE PEANUTS BUT IT WASN'T PEANUTS PEANUTS IT WAS SOMETHING REALLY COOL
HE LAUGHED EVEN THOUGH I WASN'T JOKING HE S SAID HE THOUGHT I WOULD MAKE A GREAT PILOT SOMEDAY IF I WANTED TO BE
EVER AND HE WOULD ACTUALLY GETTING A LITTLE BIT SCARED OF THIS SWISH KID
BUT MUD KEPT SINGING HIS LULLABY FOR A FEW HOURS BUT HE STOPPED RIGHT BEFORE SUNSET
THEY SURE SURE THEY ARE NICE TO ME NOW BECAUSE I THINK I CAN WIN THE RACE
STARTED THEIR CRAWL TOWARD
YOU'RE JUST TRYING TO MAKE ME QUIT I'M NOT GOING TO FALL FOR YOUR TRICKS
THE MAYOR OF PONDLAND WENT TO PRESENT TURTLE CUP TO SLUDGE POND AGAIN
SWISH SWISH HAS TO RACE HE'S THE SLOWEST TURTLE I'VE EVERY SEEN EXCEPT FOR MUD OF COURSE
HAD GONE A FEW FEET EXCEPT FOR TWO
EVERYTHING ABOUT THE FESTIVAL WAS FUN BUT THE MAIN EVENT WAS THE GREAT TURTLE RACE
THAT SWISH WAS REALLY REALLY REALLY SLOW
THE MAYOR TAPPED ON
THERE WERE THOUSANDS OF TURTLES MANY DIFFERENT SPECIES ALL HAVING A GREAT TIME
MS SNAPPER WAS NEVER NICE TO ANYONE BUT SHE WAS BEING NICE TO SWISH
HE WOULD NEVER LOSE
THE BY THEM
THAT THE WINNER WOULD TAKE HOME TO THEIR VILLAGE
SO WITH SWISH THEY THOUGHT MAYBE JUST MAYBE HE COULD BRING THE BACK THE TURTLE CUP
WENT UP TO SWISH AND GAVE HIM THE TURTLE CUP SHE SAID SWISH YOU ARE THE YOUNGEST WINNER OF THE GREAT RACE GREAT TURTLE RACE
OKAY
HOW COME THEY DON'T MOVE THAT BIG ROCK OUT OF THE MIDDLE OF THE FIELD IT SEEMS TO EVERYONE'S WAY
BUT IF I LOSE THEY'LL BE DISAPPOINTED AND MAD AT ME
IT WOULD TAKE SOME TURTLES FAR AWAY FROM THE VILLAGES TWO WHOLE WEEKS JUST TO GET THERE
THIS TIME IT WAS A BIT CLOSER THAN YOU WOULD HAVE LIKED IT I BET I'LL BET
SWISHES FATHER SAID SON DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT
HE WAS THE SLOWEST TURTLE OF ALL TIME IMAGINE HE HADN'T
THE REAL WINNER IS SWISH SOFTBELLY OF BLUE POND THE CROWD WENT WILD
SWISH'S MOM SMILED
AFTER SIX HOURS MUD AND SWISH WERE STILL TIED AND HAD ONLY MOVED A FEW INCHES
THE RULES WERE NAILED TO A TREE FOR ALL TO SEE
THIS MEANS THAT WE HAVE A NEW CHAMPION
BUT THEN HE SNAPPED OUT OF IT AND REMEMBERED HIS FATHER TELLING HIM ABOUT THIS TRICK AND HE
IT WAS A IT WAS RUMORED
THERE
BUT SHE WAS
HE ALWAYS MADE SURE THAT NO ONE TREATED HIM SPECIAL THAT HE LIKED TO BE TREATED BY EVERYBODY AND HE WANTED TO BE TREATED LIKE A TURTLE WITH HONOR
ALL OVER THE LAND STARTED TO CRAWL THERE
ALL TURTLES MUST GO AS FAST AS THEY CAN AT ALL TIMES
WE ALL WANT YOU TO LOOK GOOD
THE CROWD WENT WILD AGAIN
AND THE SUN WENT DOWN MUD WAS THE CLOSEST UHM TURTLE TO THE STARTING LINE
SWISH MADE A LOUD GULP SOUND
THIS TURTLE WAS NAMED SWISH
SAID READY SET SLOW AND OFF THEY WENT
I CAN'T BEAT MUD ANYWAY I HEARD ONCE IT TOOK HIM THREE DAYS JUST TO YAWN
THE SLOWEST TURTLE
BUT UNTIL THE NEXT FESTIVAL
BUT THEN RIGHT AT THE END RIGHT BEFORE THE SUNSET SWISH STARTED TO PULL AHEAD OF MUD
GREAT POND
THEN MUD TRIED ANOTHER TRICK HE STARTED SINGING A SOFT BEAUTIFUL LULLABY
IT LOOKED AS IF NEITHER OF THEM HAD MOVED AT ALL
BUT HE DOESN'T WANT TO BE TREATED SPECIAL HE JUST WANTS TO BE NORMAL AND HE DOESN'T WANT EVERYBODY TO HATE HIM IF HE CAN'T BEAT MUD
UHM HELLO HELLO MUD MUD STILL DIDN'T ANSWER IN FACT MUD WAS SOUND ASLEEP MUD HAD ACTUALLY SUNG HIMSELF TO SLEEP
SWISH S WAS SUDDENLY VERY EXCITED
THERE WERE MANY L LEGENDS ABOUT HIM
SWISH STARTED YAWNING
THE SLOWEST TURTLE FROM EACH POND WERE CARRIED TO THE STARTING LINE BY MEMBERS OF THEIR VILLAGE
MISTER PEEKS WOULD NEVER DO ANYTHING FOR FREE
THE TURTLE CUP FOR THE REST OF HIS LONG LIFE
THAT'S BECAUSE NO ONE COULD EVER BEAT THE TURTLE
WHEN THE TIME OF THE FESTIVAL DREW NEAR ALL THE TURTLES
ALL THE TURTLES MUST RUN AS FAST AS THEY CAN AND THE TURTLE THAT IS THE CLOSEST TO THE STARTING LINE WINS
I THINK YOU'LL BE A GREAT CHAMPION FOR MANY YEARS SINCE TURTLES HAVE ONLY GOTTEN SLOWER WITH THE AGE
THAT'S NOT A ROCK SWEETIE SAID MOM THAT'S MUD
JUST THEN THE MAYOR
THERE WERE LOTS OF EATING AND LAUGHING
THE TURTLES BUT HE GOT A LITTLE OLDER THE TURTLES BEGAN TO REALIZE
THE CROWD STARTED YELLING SPEECH SPEECH
THEN HE TOLD SWISH ABOUT ALL THE MUDDY ALL OF MUD'S DIRTY TRICKS SO THAT SWISH WOULD BE READY FOR THEM
HAD TO MOVE FOR FIFTY YEARS
THIS WAS SWISH'S FIRST EVER SHELL SHELL UH SHELL DWELLERS FESTIVAL
THAT DAY FOR THE FIRST TIME HE WOULD TAKE IT MANY MORE TIMES AFTER THAT
SWISH READ THE RULES EVEN THOUGH HE KNEW THEM IN HIS HEART
THE TURTLE CUP WAS A TROPHY
MOSTLY NICE TURTLES LIVED IN BLUE POND
MS TORT
RULING
I KNOW THAT YOU CAN WIN SWISH BUT WE'LL BE PROUD OF YOU EVEN IF YOU DON'T WIN IT'S JUST AN HONOR TO GET TO THE RACE SAID SWISH'S MOM
MUD KNEW THAT THIS WOULD BE THE CLOSEST RACE HE HAD EVER
WE'LL WE NEVER THOUGHT THAT THEY AGREED THOUGHT OF THAT THEY AGREED
BLUE POND WAS A LOCATED ABOUT THREE DAYS CRAWL FROM THE GREAT POND
AND GAVE HIM EARPLUGS
WERE ABOUT THREE HUNDRED TURTLES RACING
HE WAS GIVING SWISH A FREE SHELL WAXING
YOU'RE CHEATING YOU'RE GOING TO RUIN THE GREAT RACE FOREVER
CRAWL
RULE NUMBER FOUR NO TURTLE MAY FALL ASLEEP SINCE IF YOU ARE ASLEEP YOU AREN'T RUNNING AS FAST AS YOU CAN
WHEN YOU BRING HOME THE CUP
THEY WERE VERY PROUD HE GAVE MUD SUCH A CLOSE RACE SWISH WAS HAPPY TOO
SO IT TOOK SOME TIME BEFORE ANYONE COULD FIGURE OUT WHICH OF THE TURTLES WERE THE SLOWEST
ALL THE TURTLES IN BLUE POND HELD A MEETING TO DISCUSS THIS PROBLEM
TO RACE FOR HIS VILLAGE
WHO IS THIS YOUNG PUNK HE THOUGHT TO HIMSELF
THE CROWD THOUGHT HE MUST HAVE REALIZED THAT IT WASN'T WORKING
HE SAID TURTLES NEVER CHEAT I'M A TURTLE WITH HONOR
BUT WITHOUT HIM WE DON'T HAVE A CHANCE
HE ANNOUNCED
MAYOR OF THE GREAT POND
ONCE HIS MOTHER CALLED HIM FOR DINNER AND HE DIDN'T
SWISH AND MUD WERE BOTH IN THE BACK AT THE STARTING LINE
EVERY WINNER OF THE GREAT TURTLE RACE WAS SO IMPORTANT THAT HE OR SHE DIDN'T HAVE TO MOVE FOR YEARS
THEN HE HEARD THE MAYOR SAY RUNNERS PLEASE TAKE YOUR POSITIONS
AND NO ONE OF THE TRICKIEST TURTLES IN HISTORY
LOOK THERE'S YOUR COUSIN PEEK A BOO FROM BIG PUDDLE VILLAGE SAID SWISH'S MOTHER YOU'LL GET TO MEET ALL SORTS OF NEW TURTLES
THAT WAS THE MOST EXCITING FINISH WE'VE EVER HAD
EVERYONE TREATED SWISH DIFFERENTLY FOR EXAMPLE MISTER PEEKS THE LOCAL SHELL CLEANER WOULD SAY HEY
MUD SAID TO SWISH THERE'S NO WAY THAT
AS THE SKY DID TURNED FROM BLACK TO DARK BLUE THEY LOOKED AT THE HORIZON THE SUN WAS STARTING THE RISE
I NEVER PROMISED
WAS IN HIS PRIME
BUT WHAT YOU LIKE TO SAY TO ALL THE TURTLES AT THE FESTIVAL
YOU KNOW MY GRANDFATHERS RACED MUD ONCE HE WAS AS SLOW AS YOU BUT HE DID TEACH ME A THING OR TWO
WHEN ALL THE TURTLES ARRIVED THERE WAS A SEVEN DAY FESTIVAL CALLED THE SHELL DWELLERS FESTIVAL
FINALLY AFTER THE LONG JOURNEY ALL THE TURTLES HAVE ARRIVED AT GREAT POND
RULE NUMBER TWO ALL TURTLES MUST RUN AS FAST AS THEY CAN AND THE TURTLE THAT IS CLOSEST TO STARTING THE LINE WINS
THE LESS A TURTLE MOVES THE BIGGER THEY GOT AND THE LONGER THEY LIVE SO YOU CAN SEE WINNING THE GREAT RACE IS A GREAT HONOR
HE WAS SO SLOW HIS HEART WOULD ONLY BEAT ONCE A DAY HIS NAME WAS MUD
THEY READ RULE NUMBER ONE THE GREAT RACE BEGINS AT SUNRISE AND ENDS AT SUNSET
AND HE WAS ONLY ONE FOOT AWAY
BY NOW ALL THE TURTLES WERE WAY AHEAD OF MUD BUT THIS TIME SWISH WAS JUST AS SLOW
AND S SAID SWISH'S SWISH'S FATHER
SINCE TURTLES N NEVER CHEAT THIS IS THE MOST IMPORTANT RULE TO BREAK THIS RULE WOULD MEAN AN END TO THE GREAT TURTLE RACE FOREVER
SWISH TOOK THE CUP
I WAS FASTER THAN YOU WERE YOUNG I WAS YOUR AGE
THE TURTLES WERE VERY VERY SLOW
SO ONE DAY HE TOLD HIS PARENTS I DON'T WANT TO RACE
SWISH S WAS SAD THAT HE LOST THE LOST BUT ALL THE TURTLES FROM THE BLUE POND CHEERED FOR SWISH
WHEN SWISH WAS BORN EVERYONE THOUGHT HE WAS A LITTLE SLOW BUT HE GOT BUT
WELL MUD IT LOOKS LIKE YOU'VE DONE IT AGAIN SLUDGE POND WINS THE TURTLE CUP AGAIN
EVERY FOUR YEARS TURTLES FROM ALL OVER THE LAND WOULD CRAWL TO GREAT POND
FROM THERE
YEARS TO GET TO GREAT POND BY HIMSELF
THE LESSON
ALL THESE TURTLES WILL KNOW THAT BLUE POND RULES I'M NOT AFRAID OF MUD
OH NO THE SH THE SH SHOUTED THE FANS
SWISH HAD TO BE CARRIED ON HIS FATHER'S BACK SINCE IT WOULD HAVE TAKEN HIM
WELL
MS TORT POSTED THE RULES OF THE RACE FOR EVERYONE TO SEE
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN MEN MS MS TORT MUD FROM SLUDGE POND HAS BEEN DISQUALIFIED FOR SLEEPING DURING THE RACE
MAKE IT HOME UNTIL BREAKFAST THE NEXT DAY MORNING
THEY WERE BOTH MOVING OF COURSE BUT THEY WERE SO SLOW IT WAS HARD TO TELL
YOU HAVE TO REMEMBER THAT EVEN THOUGH HE'S GIFTED HE'S STILL VERY YOUNG
BUT THOUGH HE BECAME THE GREATEST THE BIGGEST TURTLE OF ALL TIME MUCH GREATER OR BIGGER THAN MUD
HE TOLD HIS MOM YOU KNOW WHAT I'M GOING TO WIN THIS RACE I KNOW IT
BUT HE WAS SO TIRED FROM RACING HE THOUGHT THAT IT BE NICE TO JUST LISTEN TO MUD'S SWEET VOICE AND FALL
RULE NUMBER THREE NO TURTLE MAY PRETEND TO GO BE GOING AS FAST AS THEY CAN BUT GO SLOW INSTEAD
FOR THE FIRST TIME IN SEVEN HUNDRED YEARS I WOULD LIKE TO PRESENT THE TURTLE CUP TO BLUE POND
THERE SWISH DO YOU WANT A FREE SHELL WAXING TODAY
A TURTLE AS YOUNG AS YOU CAN BE SO SLOW EVEN WHEN
THAT I WOULD WIN THE RACE
THERE WAS A NEW TURTLE BORN IN BLUE POND
MUD'S WINNING IT LOOKS THAT LIKE MUD IS STILL THE GREATEST TURTLE OF ALL OF THEM
MUD DIDN'T ANSWER
AFTER SEVEN DAYS OF PLAYING AND DANCING AND BUG EATING FINALLY THE DAY OF THE RACE CAME
TURTLES COULD CATCH UP WITH FRIENDS THEY HAD NOT SEEN SINCE LAST SINCE THE LAST FESTIVAL
IT WAS BECAUSE OF SWISH THAT BLUE POND BECAME THE MOST RESPECTED POND IN THE LAND
MS SNAPPER WOULD SAY HI SWISHY DO YOU WANT SOME YUMMY PIE TO FILL YOU UP AND SLOW YOU DOWN FOR THE BIG RACE A FAT TURTLE IS A SLOW TURTLE
HE WAS THE BIGGEST MOST RESPECTED
HE THOUGHT IT WAS THE MOST WONDERFUL THING HE EVER SAW
BUT THEY ALL FELT A LITTLE SAD BECAUSE THEY HADN'T HELD THE TURTLE CUP IN OVER SEVEN HUNDRED YEARS
THE TURTLES STRETCHED THE REALLY SLOW THOUGHTS
WHEN MUD
SWISH SAW A ROCK IN THE MIDDLE OF THE BIG FESTIVAL AND WONDERED ABOUT IT
THEN THE TOWN PROMISED TO SWEET TO TREAT SWISH LIKE A NORMAL TURTLE AFTER A WHILE THEY DECIDED THAT HE WOULD BE PROUD FOR
THERE WERE ALL THE SLOWEST OF SLOW
EXTRA ATTENTION MADE SWISH VERY UNCOMFORTABLE
BUT HE HE PUT THE EARPLUGS IN HIS EARS AND COULDN'T HEAR MUD'S SINGING ANYMORE
BUT SWISH WOULDN'T LET MUD SCARE HIM
AFTER A FEW HOURS MOST OF THE TURTLES
THE MAYOR O DOCTOR SOFTSHELL SAID THIS IS RIDICULOUS
BUT DOWN DEEP INSIDE HE KNEW HE WAS JUST AS SLOW AS MUD
A DAY IS A LONG TIME AND HABITS ARE POWERFUL ESPECIALLY BAD HABITS EVEN WITH THE PROMISE OF A DIME SISTER COULDN'T RE COULDN'T REMEMBER NOT TO NIBBLE MAMA AND PAPA GOT DISCOURAGED TOO
NOW SISTER WAS IN FIRST GRADE REGULAR SCHOOL WAS DIFFERENT IT WAS STILL FUN AND SHE LIKED SH AND SHE LIKED TEACHER JANE VERY MUCH BUT IT WASN'T ALL FUN
I'M JOKING I'M JOKING INTERRUPTED BROTHER AND HE AND HE WAS SORT OF
HABITS ARE VERY IMPORTANT PART OF OUR LIVES AND MOST OF THEM ARE GOOD BRUSHING YOUR TEETH AND COMBING YOUR FUR WHEN YOU GET UP IN THE MORNING
DECIDED IT NEEDED NIBBLED THE PLAN WORKED NOT PERFECTLY IT'S HARD TO BREAK A HABIT AND SISTER HAD TO GIVE SOME BACK OF THOSE PENNIES BUT IN TEN DAYS SHE HAD NINETY THREE PENNIES
YOU JUST KE YOU JUST NEED A LITTLE HELP THAT'S ALL SAID MAMA LET'S PLANT GRAN'S TULIPS WHILE I THINK ABOUT IT AND LATER I'LL TALK TO YOUR PAPA HE MAY HAVE SOME IDEAS
SISTER BEAR WHO LIVED WITH HER MAMA PAPA AND BROTHER IN THE BIG TREE HOUSE DOWN A SUNNY DIRT ROAD DEEP IN BEAR COUNTRY HAD BEEN GOING TO SCHOOL FOR QUITE A WHILE
NORMAN SUCKED HIS THUMB SUCK SUCK SUCK AND SISTER NIBBLED HER NAILS NI NIBBLE NIBBLE NIBBLE NIBBLE
WHAT AND INTERESTING IDEA SAID MAMA AS SHE LISTENED TO WISE OLD GRIZZLY GRAN
WHY IT'S SO DEEP NOW THAT I CAN'T GET OUT OF IT WITHOUT A LITTLE HELP
AND THE NEXT TIME SHE PLAYED JACKS SHE GOT ALL THE WAY UP TO TENSIES
THE BERENSTAIN BEARS AND THE BAD HABIT
THAT'S WHAT HAPPENED OF SOME OF THE CUBS IN TEACHER JANE'S CLASS
OH YOU'RE VERY WELCOME MY DEAR SAID GRAN WHEN MAMA CALLED AND HOW IS EVERYTHING AT YOUR HOUSE IS THAT SO YOU KNOW I WAS A NAIL BITER WHEN I WAS A CUB AND MY MAMA HELPED ME STOP HELPED ME TO STOP
IN REGULAR SCHOOL YOU HAVE TO CONCENTRATE AND SOMETIMES WHEN YOU CONCENTRATE YOU FORM LITTLE NERVOUS HABITS
YOU WOULD LIKE TO HAVE YOUR NICE NAILS GROW BACK WOULDN'T YOU WAS MAMA'S ANSWER OH YES SAID SISTER BUT I KEEP FORGETTING WHY IS IT SO HARD TO REMEMBER
BUT EVEN BETTER SHE HAD TEN FINE FINGERNAILS
OR TUNE THE TV OR SCRATCH WHEN YOU HAVE AN ITCH AND WHEN SISTER TRIED TO PLAY JACKS SHE COULDN'T GET ANY HIGHER THAN TWOSIES
DEAR ME NO SAID MAMA NAIL BITING IS A KIND OF NERVOUS HABIT AND SHOUTING AND THREATENING WILL JUST MAKE HER MORE NERVOUS
NEXT HAD COME KINDERGARTEN THAT WAS FUN TOO THEY WERE MARCHING GAMES AND RHYTHM BAND
IT DIDN'T TAKE SISTER LONG TO DECIDE TO PULL OFF THO BI THOSE BITS OF TAPE
JUST WAITING TO RE TO BE REMEMBERED WHEN SOME NAIL DECIDED TO
OH DEAR SAID MAMA BEAR TO SISTER WHEN THE CUBS GOT HOME FROM SCHOOL ONE DAY YOU'VE NIBBLED YOUR NAILS DOWN TO NUBBINS IN FACT YOU'VE NIBBLED THEM CLEAN OFF HOW DID THAT HAPPEN I'M NOT EXACTLY SURE MAMA SISTER SAID
HERE'S WHAT I WANT HERE IS WHERE I WANT TO PLANT THE BULBS
AND THOSE AND WITH THOSE PENNIES IN HER POCKET JINGLING WHEN SHE GOT ON THE SCHOOL BUS JINGLING WHEN SHE JUMPED ROPE IN THE SCHOOLYARD
THAT'S WHEN BROTHER BEAR LOOKED AT HIS FINGERNAILS AND PIPED YOU KNOW I THINK I MIGHT START BITING MY NAILS I COULD USE THE MONEY
THERE WAS QUITE A LOT OF WORK SPELLING NUMBER PROBLEMS ALL KINDS OF THINGS
OH WELL SIGHED MAMA LIFE GOES ON I MUST CALL GRAN AND THANK HER FOR THE TULIP BULBS
AND LOOKING BOTH WAYS BEFORE YOU CROSS A ROAD BUT SOME HABITS AREN'T SO GOOD LIKE BITING NAILS ASKED SISTER
THE BITS OF TAPE HELPED SISTER REMEMBER NOT TO NIBBLE BUT THEY ALSO GOT IN THE WAY WHEN SHE TRIED TO DO CERTAIN THINGS IT'S VERY HARD TO HOLD A PENCIL WITH TAPE ALL OVER YOUR FINGERS
I COULD READ THE RIOT ACT TO HER SUGGESTED PAPA YOU KNOW NAIL BITING IS AN OUTRAGEOUS DISGRACEFUL HABIT AND IF YOU DON'T STOP IT IMMEDIATELY
FIRST THERE HAD BEEN NURSERY SCHOOL WHICH WAS PURE FUN PLAYING WITH DOLLS AND BLOCKS ROLLING CLAY SNAKES AND SCRIBBLING WITH CRAYONS
THAT'S RIGHT SAID PAPA UNTIL THE HABIT'S BROKEN I'LL NEVER NIBBLE AGAIN SHE SAID AS SHE THOUGHT OF ALL THOSE DIMES SHE WAS GOING TO GET
THE NEXT MORNING WHEN SISTER LINED UP FOR SCHOOL LIZZY BRUIN AND SOME OTHERS BEGAN POINTING AND TEASING SISTER NIBBLES HER NAILS SISTER NIBBLES HER NAILS
BEFORE SHE KNEW IT SHE HAD NIBBLED THEM DOWN TO NUBBINS IN FACT SHE NIBBLED THEM DOWN SO FAR THAT SOME OF HER FINGERS WERE GETTING SORE
THAT'S THE WAY IT IS WITH A BAD HABIT THE MORE YOU GET THE MORE YOU USE IT THE HARDER IT IS TO GET OUT OF IT
SO THEY TRIED GRAN'S IDEA INSTEAD OF A DIME AT THE END OF EACH DAY THEY GAVE SISTER TEN PENNIES ONE FOR EACH NAIL AT THE BEGINNING OF EACH DAY TEN PENNIES TO KEEP UNLESS SHE NIBBLED
PHEW SAID PAPA BEAR I'M GLAD THAT'S OVER YES INDEED AGREED MAMA BREATHING WITH A GREAT SIGH OF RELIEF
BEFORE MAMA COULD ANSWER SISTER BEAR WHO HAD BEEN NERVOUSLY BITING IN THE NEXT ROOM POPPED IN AND SAID A DIME TEN WHOLE CENTS EVERY DAY JUST NOT FOR BITING MY NAILS
BUT WORST OF ALL THE BITS OF TAPE TOLD THE WHOLE WORLD THAT SISTER BEAR WAS A NAIL BITER
LIZZY TWIRLED HER FUR TWIRL TWIRL TWIRL FREDDY SCRATCHED HIS HEAD FREDDY SCRATCHED HIS HEAD SCRATCH SCRATCH SCRATCH
WHAT HAVE YOU TRIED SO FAR UHM UH HUH WELL I THINK YOU'RE ON THE RIGHT TRACK WITH THE DIME BUT INSTEAD OF A DIME AND INSTEAD OF GIVING IT TO HER AT THE END OF THE DAY
WELL MAMA SAID IT'S SORT OF LIKE THIS PATH IT'S WHEELED THIS BARROW OVER IT SO MANY TIMES THAT IT'S WORN A DEEP RUT TIGHT DOWN THE MIDDLE AND ITS AND IT KEEPS GETTING DEEPER EVERY TIME I USE IT
GREAT FOR PICKING UP THINGS TUNING THE TV AND SCRATCHING ITCHES
I SUPPOSE SO SAID PAPA THOUGHTFULLY PERHAPS SOME SORT OF REWARD WOULD HELP A BIT OF MONEY LET'S SAY A DIME FOR EVERY DAY SHE DOESN'T BITE HER NAILS
SHE ALSO LEARNED A LOT OF NUMBERS IN KINDERGARTEN AND MOST OF THE ALPHABET
BUT THE WAY IT TURNED OUT SHE DIDN'T GET A SINGLE DIME ALL SHE GOT WAS DISCOURAGED
A HABIT MAMA SAID AS SHE PUSHED THE WHEELBARROW ALONG THE WELL WORN PATH IS SOMETHING YOU DO SO OFTEN YOU DON'T EVEN HAVE TO THINK ABOUT IT
BUT SOME OF THEM ARE GETTING SORE HMM SAID MAMA WELL HERE'S WHAT WE WILL DO WE WILL PUT A LITTLE MEDICINE ON THE SORE ONES AND BITS OF ADHESIVE TAPE ON ALL OF THEM THAT WILL REMIND YOU NOT TO NIBBLE AND WILL GIVE THEM A CHANCE TO GROW BACK
WHAT ABOUT MY NAIL BITING HABIT ASKED SISTER AS SHE HELPED MAMA OUT OF THE DEEP RUT HOW AM I GOING TO GET RID OF IT
I CERTAINLY HOPE YOU'RE JOKING ROARED PAPA BECAUSE IF YOU'RE NOT
DAD PLEASE DON'T READ THE NEXT PART
SO IN CONCLUSION I'M GETTING HUNGRY AND I'M SORRY FOR SHAVING THE CAT
IF I HAD A CAT I WOULD TEACH IT TO NOT SHAVE ITSELF THAT'S FOR SURE
PLEASE SHAVE THE CAT IT KEEPS HITTING ME ON THE SHELL AND TRYING TO ROLL ME OVER WHEN YOU LEAVE THE ROOM
I SAW THAT THE CAT WAS TRYING TO GET I GET THE GERBILS AND TOLD AND TOLD AND YOU TOLD US WE COULDN'T HIT HIM
LAST NIGHT I SAW HER I SAW THAT SHE DIDN'T BRUSH HER TEETH OH YEAH I FORGOT TO TELL YOU THAT
DEAR MOM DON'T LET DAD KNOW THE REAL REASON I SHAVED THE CAT WAS THAT HE AL HE'S ALWAYS SNEEZING AROUND IT
PLUS I FORGOT TO TELL YOU THAT SHE THAT YOU SHOULD BLAME MS CASPER MY S MY TEACHER
AND DID STUPID THINGS
I HAVE WHAT DAD CALLS LIFE EXPERIENCE
BUT SO WHAT IF WIN IF IT'S WINTER I MEAN I'LL BE IT'LL BE SUMMER SOON ENOUGH
I WOULD LIKE TO START BY SAYING THAT I THINK YOU ARE A VERY MEAN TO MAKE ME DO THIS BECAUSE WASN'T EVEN MY FAULT
I KNEW OUR CAT WOULD GROW HER FUR BACK
THE CAT LIKED BEING SHAVED ANYWAY SO I DON'T THINK SEE THE BIG DEAL
BUT THE REALEST REASON I SHAVED THE CAT WAS TO MAKE A WIG FOR THOSE POOR HAIR LESS CATS THAT WE SAW ON TV ON THE ANIMAL CHANNEL
SINCERELY DANNY
DID YOU KNOW THAT I WANTED TO BE A BARBER
I COULDN'T BUY HIM ANYTHING NICE SINCE YOU TOOK AWAY MY ALLOWANCE FOR WHEN I SHAVED THE NEIGHBOR'S DOG
AND SOON SHE WOULD HAVE AN INV INVINCIBLE COAT OF CAT FUR ARMOR
DEAR MOM AND DAD
YOU COULD BE PROUD OF ME FOR THINKING SO FAST ON MY TOES
PLUS IF YOU WEREN'T ALWAYS CUDDLING WITH MY SISTER SO MUCH MAYBE SHE WOULD HAVE BEEN WITH HER CAT
YOU WOULDN'T ALWAYS TAKE THE CAT'S SIDE YOU WOULD ALWAYS TAKE THE CAT'S SIDE IF YOU KNEW THE STUFF HE DID TO MY POOR TURTLE
SO I GRABBED DAD'S NOSE HAIR CLIPPERS AND SHAVED IT
I THINK THAT SHE SHOULD BRUSH HER TEETH TWICE TONIGHT THAT'S JUST MY OPINION THOUGH
SO I THOUGHT IF I GOT RID OF HIS FUR HE WOULDN'T SNEEZE AND THAT YOU WOULD HAVE A BETTER MARRIAGE
SHE SAID THAT WHEN WE SHAVE HAIR IT GROWS BACK UNDER HARDER AND SOMETIMES EVEN DARKER
BESIDES THE REAL REASON I SHAVED THE CAT WAS TO KEEP IT NICE AND COOL
PLUS OSCAR MY TURTLE TOLD ME TO SHAVE THE CAT
I REALLY DIDN'T MEAN TO SHAVE THE CAT REALLY I SWEAR
SHE'S SO GOOD AT SCHOOL AND YOU BOUGHT HER A CAT CAUSE SHE'S SO RESPONSIBLE AND STUFF
THEY'RE ARE CALLED HAIRLESS CATS AND THEY NEED FUR IN THE WINTER SOME SOMETIMES I THINK I I SWEAR THAT'S THE REASON
AND AND YOU KNOW WHAT THOSE STUPID GERBILS DIDN'T EVEN THANK ME THEY JUST RAN ON THAT STUPID WHEEL AND DIDN'T
I PROMISE THAT I'LL DO A BETTER JOB THEN I DID ON THE CAT CAUSE NOW CAUSE NOW I HAVEN'T I HAVE THAT
THE ONLY REASON IT HASN'T COME OUT FOR TWO WEEKS IS BECAUSE YOU GUYS MADE SUCH A BIG DEAL ABOUT IT
I WAS AFRAID YOU WOULDN'T LET ME PRACTICE ON MY OWN HEAD CAN I PRACTICE BY SHAVING JENNY'S HEAD
TURTLES DON'T DO ANYTHING EXCEPT POKE THEIR HEADS OUT AND OUT AND BE NOT CUDDLY
AND RAN RIGHT BY THE CLIPPERS AND SHAVED HERSELF
ALTHOUGH YOU CAN SEE THAT IT'S REALLY JENNY'S FAULT FOR NOT BEING AS RESPONSIBLE AS YOU ALWAYS SAY AND NOT BRUSHING HER TEETH
YOU GUYS NEVER LIKED OSCAR AS MUCH AS THE CAT ANYWAY
I DON'T HAVE ANY I DON'T HAVE TO GET GOOD GRADES TO KNOW WHAT YOU SHOULD TEACH A CAT THAT YOU SHOULD TEACH A CAT TO SHAVE ITSELF
DEAR MOM AND DAD JENNY DIDN'T BRUSH HER TEETH LAST NIGHT
PS IF YOU WOULD
SO YOU SO YOU I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT ELSE I COULD DO
SHE MADE US SHAVE SOMETHING FOR SCIENCE ASK HER
I KNOW HOW MUCH YOU HATE HIM ALWAYS SNEEZING AND STUFF
NOT THAT I SHAVED THE CAT THOUGH
THAT IS THE LAST TIME I THAT IS THE LAST TIME I SHAVE THE CAT TO THE P TO THE PROJECT ANY STUPID GERBILS
AND I JUST WANTED TO I JUST WANTED THE CAT TO GET USED TO THE IDEA BEFORE IT GOT REALLY HOT
AND SOON SHE WOULD HAVE WAIT AND YOU COULD TAKE HER ON TV SHOWS AND GET LOTS OF MONEY SO THAT YOU CAN CAN SEND JENNY TO COLLEGE EVEN IF SHE IS A DUMB LITTLE TATTLE TALE
I COULDN'T HELP IT ANYWAY IT WAS AN ACCIDENT AND I DIDN'T EVEN DO IT ON PURPOSE
BUT SOMETIMES C BUT SOME CATS DON'T HAVE HAIR
THAT GREAT UNDER P PRESSURE
I THINK I REALLY LIKE ITS HAIRCUT
I WAS AFRAID TO TELL YOU THE REAL REASON I SHAVED THE CAT THAT WAS I WANT TO BE A BARBER AND I NEEDED PRACTICE
THEN SHE SAW THEN SHE WOULD BE A SUPER CAT
HOW COME JENNY GETS A CAT I GET A STUPID TURTLE ANYWAY
UHM ACTUALLY THE TRUTH IS THAT I BY ACCIDENT TURNED ON THE NOSE HAIR CLIPPERS AND THE CAT WAS BEING CHASED BY THE TURTLE
YOU GUYS WILL JUST PROBABLY SAY IT'S WINTER DANNY CATS DON'T OVERHEAT IN WINTER
SINCE YOU HAVE GROUNDED ME AND TOLD ME TO WRITE DOWN WHY I AM SORRY BEFORE I WAS ALLOWED OUT OF MY ROOM I AM MAD AT YOU
OH SURE IT'S EASY TO SAY THAT I SHOULD HAVE JUST PICKED UP THE CAT UP PUT PICKED THE CAT UP BUT SOMETIMES WE DON'T ALWAYS THINK THAT GREAT
CAT'S AREN'T ALWAYS NICE JUST LIKE MY LITTLE S SISTER JENNY ISN'T ALWAYS NICE
INSTEAD THE CAT CAME INTO MY ROOM BECAUSE JENNY NEVER PLAYS WITH IT UHM ENOUGH
I BET YOU DIDN'T KNOW SOMETHING ELSE
IF YOU WOULD HAVE BROUGHT BOUGHT HER A TURTLE I COULDN'T HAVE SHAVED IT
SO I THOUGHT THAT IF I COULD SHAVE THE CAT A LOT A LOT OF BUNCH OF TIMES HER HAIR WOULD GROW BACK HARDER EACH TIME
SO IT WAS REALLY MY FATHER'S DAY GIFT TO HIM
ACTUALLY THE TRUTH IS
I JUST DIDN'T WANT TO SEE THE CAT GETTING ALL THE ALL THE HOT AND UNCOMFORTABLE STUFF
FINE OSCAR CAN'T REALLY TALK BUT IF HE COULD HE WOULD HAVE SAID
SHE JUST IGNORED ME SEE I SEE SHE'S NOT SO RESPONSIBLE AFTER ALL
JUST CAUSE SHE'S A GOOD STUDENT DOESN'T MEAN SHE'S REALLY RESPONSIBLE
OK HERE'S WHAT HAPPENED AS I REMEMBER IT
I ALSO WAS GOING TO SELL THE CAT'S FUR TO BUY MY SISTER JENNY BRACES FOR HER BIG STUPID FACE
POOR KITTY THIS POOR KITTY THAT IT'S IT'S YOUR FAULT REALLY
CAN I GET A DOG PLEASE
I KEPT SAYING NO KITTY DON'T SHAVE YOURSELF BUT MY STUPID SISTER NEVER TAUGHT HER CAT HOW TO LISTEN
SHE COULD BE VERY SHE COULD BE A VERY PERSUASIVE LITTLE BIRD WHEN SHE WANTED TO BE
DO YOU KNOW THAT SINCE THE LITTLE PANDA BUILT THE BAMBOO ROCKET SHIP THAT THESE AND THOSE MAGPIE'S STARTED FLUTTERING ABOUT THE ZOO P THAT THE ZOO PROFITS HAVE G GONE UP FOUR THOUSAND PERCENT
OH WISE OWL I HAVE A QUESTION THAT I FEAR ONLY YOU CAN ANSWER HE SAID
YES THE BIG ONE IN THE SKY THAT IS MOST LIKELY NOT MADE OF CHEESE AND MOST CERTAINLY NOT MADE OF BAMBOO
THE OTHER REASON WAS THAT ANYONE WHO GETS TO WITHIN THREE FEET OF A PANDA AUTOMATICALLY FALLS IN LOVE WITH THEM IT'S THE LAW OF NATURE
AN INSTANT LATER THE YOUNG BOY WAS HEARD SAYING OUCH MOM CUT THAT OUT
NO ONE COULD BLAME FRED REALLY SINCE NO ONE REALLY WANTS TO BE EATEN
ONE MORNING FRED WAS FEEDING YIN YIN AND SAID OH YIN YIN I WISH MORE PEOPLE WOULD COME TO VISIT THE ZOO
ONE TWO THREE TO THE MOON S THEY SAID TOGETHER PULLING WITH ALL THEIR MIGHT
SO BEFORE HE RAN OFF TO HUG THE PALM TREE HE QUICKLY SAID
THEY WERE IN ORDER OF CUTENESS YIN YIN THE YOUNG DAUGHTER POO POO THE MOTHER AND MOO MAN THE THE GENTLE AND ALWAYS SLEEPY FATHER
THIS ALMOST CERTAINLY BECAME ACCOUNTED FOR
AS FOR YIN YIN SHE WAS PROUD TO BE VERY RENAMED AFTER THE FAMOUS EXPLORER AND SHE AND MAGPIE NEVER STOPPED TRYING TO GET TO THE MOON
AND A ONE HUNDRED POUND BA BAMBOO ROCKET SHIP TO THE MOON SAID MAGGIE
HER MOTHER AND FATHER UHM KNEW WHAT THEY WERE TALKING ABOUT SINCE THEY HAD THOUGHT THEY HADN'T THOUGHT OR TALKED OF MUCH ELSE SINCE YIN YIN SAID I WANT TO GO THERE AND POINTED TO THE MOON
HE WANTED TO BE A BUSINESS MAN BUT INSTEAD HE BECAME A GREAT EXPLORER
WAS ALWAYS ONE TO TAKE GOOD ADVICE FROM HER FATHER AND LESS THAN A WEEK LATER YIN YIN AND MAGGIE HAD TO BUILD A ROCKET SHIP OUT OF BAMBOO
SO ONE DAY AFTER FRED HAD FED THE PANDAS HE WAS HUGGING THE PALM TREE THE ZOO MANAGER CAME UP TO HIM
BUT HE WAS SUPPORTIVE OF OF HIS YOUNG DAUGHTER AND SHOWED HIS SUPPORT BY TAKING A NAP
FRED WAS STARTING TO FEEL THE UNCONTROLLABLE URGE TO HUG THE PANDA
I'M NOT SURE EXACTLY REPLIED MAGGIE
ACTUALLY IT WAS AN EIGHTY FIVE POINT FIVE DEGREE SPOT ON HIS LEFT KIDNEY BUT THE POINT IS THAT HE WAS VERY FOND OF FEEDING THE PANDAS
AFTER ALL IF IT WEREN'T FOR YIN YIN THEY HAD TO MOVE FROM THEIR WONDERFUL HOME
THE ZOO MANAGER LAUGHED AND WALKED AWAY BUT DI BUT DID PURCHASE A FASHIONABLE YELLOW UMBRELLA FOR FRED THE NEXT DAY
FRED THOUGHT ABOUT IT AND SAID YOU KNOW I THINK WE SHOULD RENAME YIN YIN COLUMBUS
NO HOW MANY PEOPLE HOW MANY MAGPIE'S WOULD IT WOULD BE NEEDED TO FLY A FOUR HUNDRED PANDA BEAR TO THE
FRED WAS NOT ALLOWED TO ACTUALLY HUG THE PANDA BEARS SINCE THAT COULD BE DANGEROUS
THE ZOO KEEPER SAID GOOD HEAVENS MAN THAT IS A GREAT IDEA NOW WAIT A SECOND I DON'T UNDERSTAND
YIN YIN ALWAYS
FOR FRED WHEN IT CAME TO PANDAS HE HAD A WARM SPOT IN HIS HEART
NOW WHILE ALL THIS WAS GOING ON WHAT DO YOU SUPPOSE FRED WAS DOING
I DON'T THINK IT WOULD TAKE THAT LONG TO ROLL THERE SAID YIN YIN
IT'S NOT THAT YOU AREN'T SELLING ENOUGH STUFFED PANDA BEARS IT'S JUST THAT WE HAVEN'T IT'S JUST THAT THERE HAVEN'T BEEN ENOUGH PEOPLE COMING TO SEE YOU IN THE FIRST PLACE
HMM HEAVIER THAN I THOUGHT I THINK WE'LL NEED SOME MORE MAGPIES SAID MAGGIE
NOW IF YOU'LL EXCUSE ME I NEED TO SQUEEZE SOMETHING BEFORE I SCREAM
A LOT OF BAMBOO CAN GET QUITE HEAVY SO BECAUSE OF THE PANDAS FRED BECAME VERY STRONG AND WAS IN TERRIFIC SHAPE
FRED FED THE PANDA BEARS AND TIGERS AND TURTLES THE TURTLES WEREN'T SO BAD BUT AS FOR THE TIGERS HE WASN'T SO SURE
LIKE IT OR NOT WE ARE SPOKESPEOPLE FOR THE PANDA STUFFED ANIMAL INDUSTRY WHICH YOUNG LADY HELPS PAY FOR THE BAMBOO YOU EAT
BY THIS STRANGE MOST MAGICAL EFFECT ON THAT THE PANDAS POSSESSES
A WEEK LATER MAGGIE MANAGED TO ROUND UP TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND AND SEVENTY EIGHT MAGPIES
WELL IT SEEMS TO ME SIR SAID YIN YIN THAT YIN YIN WANTED TO BE A GREAT EXPLORER AND INSTEAD BECAME A BUSINESS WOMAN
AT LEAST TO THE YIN YINS PARENTS FRED SURE WAS IMPRESSED THOUGH
IT'S TAKEN ME A COUPLE OF WEEKS TO FIGURE IT OUT BUT I THINK YIN YIN WANTS TO GO TO THE MOON AND THE MAGPIES WANT TO TAKE HER THERE SAID FRED
NONSENSE SAID THE MOTHER I'M SO MAD
A WEEK LATER DESPITE MUCH FLAPPING THEY WERE STILL TRYING TO GET THE ROCKET INTO THE AIR
ONE MORE THING SIR THOSE MAGPIES FLYING ABOUT THE PANDAS DO YOU THINK THE ZOO COULD PURCHASE ME A LARGE SIZE UMBRELLA
THIS IS JUST THE TYPE OF EXPOSURE WE NEEDED THESE THOSE PANDAS WILL BE WITH US FOR A LONG TIME
YIN YIN AND HER BEST FRIEND MAGGIE THE MAGPIE WHO LOOKED A LOT LIKE A PANDA IF
HOW TO TURN YOUR HEAD ALL THE WAY AROUND WITHOUT GETTING A TERRIBLE PAIN IN YOUR NECK SAID THE OWL
I'M SORRY TO SAY BUT MANY A LITTLE BOY'S CHEEKS HAVE BEEN RAW FROM WHEN MOTHER POO POO PANDA WAS UPSET
AT FURTHER DISTANCES PANDAS HAVE STRANGE ALMOST MAGICAL EFFECT ON HUMAN BEINGS WHICH MAKES THEM WANT TO HUG HUG AND SQUEEZE THINGS
BUT I JUST LEARNED HOW TO MAKE MYSELF INTO A BALL AND ROLL TWO DAYS AGO AND I'VE BECOME AND I'M BECOMING COMING VERY GOOD AT IT
IT TURNS OUT THAT THE OWL DID NOT TAKE IN CONSIDERATION THAT ONCE YOU ARE OVER A THOUSAND MAGPIE TOGETHER THEY TEND TO FIGHT AND DON'T AGREE ON A SINGLE THING
SOME PEOPLE LIKE TO BITE THEIR FINGER NAILS BUT FRED WASN'T A NAIL BITER SO BEING EATEN WAS DEFINITELY NOT SOMETHING THAT HE LOOKED FORWARD TO EACH AFTERNOON AT THREE O'CLOCK WHEN IT WAS TIME TO FEED THE TIGERS
I SEE YOUR WINGS FLAPPING BUT WE DON'T SEEM TO BE GOING ANYWHERE SAID YIN YIN
I KNOW I SHOULDN'T BE TELLING YOU THIS BUT WE MIGHT HAVE TO SELL YOU AND YOUR FAMILY TO THE BIG ZOO IN LOS ANGELES IF WE DON'T GET MORE MONEY
IT COSTS SO MUCH TO FEED YOU PANDA BEARS I WOULD HATE IF YOU HAD TO LEAVE US AFTER ALL IT'S THE ONLY HOME YOU KNOW BESIDES IF YOU LEAVE I'LL GET TERRIBLY OUT OF SHAPE
MANY KNOW MANY PEOPLE KNOW THAT PANDAS EAT BAMBOO A LOT OF IT
YOUR JOB IS TO BE CUTE SO PEOPLE WILL TO RUN TO THE GIFT SHOP AND BUY PANDA BEAR DOLLS IT'S SIMPLY ECONOMICS
IT WAS FRED'S IDEA SO LET'S BEGIN WITH FRED
ENOUGH OF THIS NONSENSE SAID YIN YIN'S MOTHER POO POO WHAT SORT OF NONSENSE IS THIS FOR A YOUNG PANDA BEAR GOING TO THE MOON INDEED NONSENSE
THE OWL INSTANTLY REPLIED TWO HUNDRED S THOUSAND SEVENTY SIX GIVE OR TAKE TWO
BAMBOO IS VERY WORK WORKABLE SUBSTANCE AND PANDAS TEND TO HANDLE BAMBOO A LOT SO THIS ITSELF WAS NOT VERY ASTONISHING
YES BUT DOES THAT HAVE WHAT DOES THAT HAVE TO DO WITH THE PANDAS MAN THE ZOO KE SAID THE ZOO MANAGER
BEFORE HE FELL ASLEEP HE DIDN'T HE DID MANAGE TO SAY I BELIEVE ROLLING IS DECIDEDLY ROUND ABOUT WAY TO GO IF YOU MUST GO IT WOULD BE BEST TO FLY
WHAT IS GOING ON WITH YOUR PANDAS FRED I'VE NEVER SEEN ANYTHING LIKE IT
THE FATHER WATCHING ALL THIS THROUGH ONE EYE FOR HE ALWAYS HAD AT LEAST ONE EYE ASLEEP AT ALL TIMES SAID
THERE WERE THREE PANDAS AND THEY WERE KNOWN AS THE PAN FAMILY
THE PANDA
IT IS INTERESTING TO POINT OUT THE TIME THAT THEY WERE S THAT MORE WERE STUFFED THAT MORE STUFFED PANDAS WERE SOLD AT THE ZOO GIFT SHOPS THEN ALL THE OTHER STUFF COMBINED
BUT LATER F WHEN FRED WALKED INTO THE PANDA'S HOME UNDER HIS NEW YELLOW UMBRELLA ALL THAT SHE COULD THINK O TO SAY WAS NONSENSE
BACK IN THE PANDA'S HOME THE MOTHER PANDA POO POO WAS VERY PROUD OF HER DAUGHTER
LIKE A PANDA WOULD IF PANDAS WERE BIRDS WERE DISCUSSING ABOUT GOING TO THE MOON
SO ALL THE OTHER PEOPLE AT THE ZOO WOULD KNOW THAT THE PANDAS HAD JUST BEEN FED WHEN THEY SAW FRED HUGGING THE RATHER RATHER UN CUDDLY PALM TREE OUTSIDE THE PANDA'S HOME
WELL SIR COLUMBUS SET OUT ON A SHIP HE WAS REALLY TO TRYING TRYING TO FIND A QUICKER WAY TO GET TO GET AROUND THE W EUROPE IN ORDER TO IMPROVE IMPROVE TRADE
YIN YIN'S FATHER MOO MAN DIDN'T THINK IT WAS VERY PROPER OR WISE FOR A YOUNG PANDA BEAR TO GO ROLLING OFF TO PLACES WHERE THERE WASN'T ANY BAMBOO
WHY HE WAS THE FEEDING THE PANDAS LIKE HE WAS SUPPOSED TO
YES BUT HOW DO WE GET MORE YIN YIN SAID
I THINK WHAT THE ZOO NEEDS IS A GREAT ADVERTISING CA CAMPAIGN
BUT YIN YIN WAS THE YOUNGEST PANDA WAS NOT LISTENING TO FRED SHE WAS TALKING TO HER BEST FRIEND MAGGIE THE MAGPIE ABOUT GOING TO THE MOON
I'M GOING TO LOOK AT THAT LADY OVER THERE AND MAKE HER WANT TO SQUEEZE HER SON CHEEKS SHE SAID SPITEFULLY
BUT PHYSICAL FITNESS WAS NOT THE ONLY REASON THAT FRED LOVED THE PANDAS
SUCH NONSENSE GOING TO THE MOON SAID HER MOTHER POO POO
HE DIDN'T MIND HANDLING THE RAW MEAT HE HAD TO FEED THE TO THE TIGERS HIS MAIN OBJECT OBJECTION UH OBJECTION WAS BEING EATEN
MAGGIE FIGURED THAT IF SHE AND THE AND THREE OF HER STRONGEST MAGPIE FRIENDS WERE ABLE TO EACH GRAB HOLD OF A CORNER OF THE ROCKET SHIP THEY COULD ALL FLY TO THE MOON SO THEY TRIED
BUT EVERYTHING WAS NOT ALL BAMBOO AND HUGS AT THE ZOO
THE MAIN OBSTACLE IT TURNS OUT WAS GETTING THE ROCKET SHIP OFF THE GROUND
I SEE FRED
OH WELL THAT MAKES SENSE THEN SAID THE MANAGER
T'WOULD BE THE BEST TO ASK THE OLD OWL THEN CLOSED HIS EYE
I SAID IF YOU CAN'T EVEN GET PAST LEVEL ONE AND YOU'RE A PILOT THEN COULD THEN I COULD BE A PILOT TOO SINCE I'M MUCH BETTER AT PUSHING BUTTONS THAN YOU ARE
SO I STARTED YELLING HEY PEANUT LADY PEANUT LADY SHE DIDN'T LIKE ME CALLING HER PEANUT LADY BUT SHE DID GET M ME MY GAME BOY
I STARTED THINKING THAT WE MIGHT CRASH I DIDN'T LIKE TO THINK ABOUT THAT BUT I COULDN'T HELP IT

ALTHOUGH I I THOUGHT AWESOME I ALSO BROUGHT A D DECK OF CARDS IN CASE THE PILOT WAS BORED AND WANTED TO PLAY GO FISH
THAT'S ALWAYS SCARY IT SEEMS LIKE THE PLANE IS GOING TOO FAST TO EVER STOP BUT IT DOES
THAT IT WASN'T REALLY THAT HARD ONCE YOU
ONE THING ABOUT BEING BY YOURSELF ON AIRPLANES IS THAT THE FLIGHT ATTENDANTS ARE VERY NICE TO YOU
HE LAUGHED EVEN THOUGH I'M WAS WASN'T JOKING HE SAID HE THOUGHT I WOULD MAKE A REALLY GREAT PILOT SOMEDAY IF I WANTED TO BE HE WAS REALLY NICE BUT HE WOULDN'T PLAY GO FISH WITH ME

THERE WAS GRANDPA WAITING FOR ME HE SAID HOW WAS YOUR FLIGHT I SAID SOMEDAY I'M GOING TO BE A PILOT AND I'M ONLY GOING TO SERVE BANANA SPLITS ON MY PLANE

THE WAY I FIGURED IT MY GAME BOY

THEY GOT TONS AND TONS OF FLIES
DOCTOR WONG THOUGHT FOR A SECOND THEN
THEN SUDDENLY A FLY LANDED ON A LITTLE GIRL THEN A FLY LANDED ON SOMEONE ELSE
COUPES AND COPS AND ROBBERS
OFF AND ACCIDENTALLY SMASHED IT INTO PIECES BUT
WHAT SHOULD THEY DO THEY CAN'T KEEP JOHN IN JAIL AND THEY WANT TO KICK HIM OUT OF THE OUT OF TOWN BECAUSE THEY ALL HAVE SU
WAS SHAPED MADE FOR A FLUTE
JUST WHEN TH JUST WHEN
JOHN THOUGHT THAT WAS AN OK IDEA BUT THERE WAS NO THERE WAS AN ECHO IN THE WELL AND THAT MADE THE FLUTE SOUND LOUDER
ACTUALLY SMASHED INTO A IN WAIT
THEY JUST CAN'T LEAD A NORMAL THEY JUST CAN'T LEAD A NORMAL LIFE
BUT IT WAS TOO LATE JOHN HAD STARTED PLAYING
BUT THERE CAN'T KEEP JOHN BUT THEY CAN'T KEEP JOHN IN JAIL SINCE HE WASN'T ALREADY BREAKING ANY LAWS SO THERE WAS NOTHING THE POLICE COULD DO
WAIT THEY CAN'T THEY COULDN'T KEEP JOHN IN JAIL AND THEY DON'T WANT TO KICK HIM OUT OF TOWN BECAUSE THEY ALL HAVE SUCH NICE TEETH
SHAPED MADE HIS FLUTE HIS FLUTE SOUND AWFUL
DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TO DO HE JUST KEPT
IN FRANKSVILLE TO CELEBRATE THE FACT THAT FOR ONCE THERE WAS NO WATER PROBLEM NO FLY PROBLEM AND
THE BAD THE BAD FLUTE PLAYER WAS ROOSTER JOHN
MAYBE A POORLY PLAYED FLUTE DOESN'T SOUND ALL THAT BAD ABOUT
BEFORE THEY KNEW IT THE TOWN WAS FILLED WITH FLIES AGAIN
AND THE CLARINET
AND
OF FLEAS
WAIT EVERYBODY LOOKED REALLY SILLY AT DANCES DANCING TO MUSIC THEY COULDN'T HEAR
THEN PRONOUNCED IT'S THE FLUTE SOUND THE FLIES HATE JOHN'S FLUTE PLAYING AS MUCH AS WE DO JOHN THE DENTIST IS DRIVING THE FLIES AWAY
THEN SOME LANDED ON A BUNCH OF PEOPLE
HE WAS VERY UPSET AT FIRST THEN HE SAID OH WELL GOOD THING I I BROUGHT MY OLD FLUTE AS BACK UP
THEY CAN'T
AWFUL THE UHM HOWEVER FOR THE SOME REASONS THE WAY HIS MOUTH WAS SHAPED
THINGS WERE GOING GOOD IN FRANKSVILLE JOHN DIDN'T
THE PEOPLE IN THE TOWN DECIDED TO HAVE A GREAT BIG PARADE
WINDOWS WERE BREAKING ALL DAY AND ALL THE COWS IN TOWN STARTED TO MAKE SO SOUR MILK
WHEN THE TOWNSFOLK HEARD THE NOISE THEY COULDN'T EVEN SWAT AT THE FLIES ANYMORE
SINCE HE HAD BECOME THE TOWN DEN DENTIST EVERYBODY'S TEETH
THE NEIGHBORS ARE COMPLAINING AND THE CATS AND DOGS ARE TRYING TO CHEW OFF THEIR EARS
BUT SOON AFTER THAT THEY STARTED TO GET FLIES
THEY HAD TO COVER THEIR EARS FROM THE HORRIBLE SOUND THE FLIES WOULD LAND ALL OVER THE PEOPLE AND THEY COULDN'T SWAT THEM OFF
HE WASN'T CALLED ROOSTER JOHN YET HE THAT CAME LATER
NO FLUTE PROBLEM
OH THAT'S A NICE INSTRUMENT BUT IT'S JUST NOT THE FLUTE I EVEN WROTE YOU A SONG CHIEF SANDERS IT'S CALLED
HE STARTED SHAKING THE FLUTE TO GET THE FLIES OFF THE
BUT JUST TRY TO IMAGINE SOMEONE SCRATCHING A CHALKBOARD WITH A F WITH A FORK FORK AND THEN MULTIPLY THAT TIMES A HUNDRED
HOWEVER YOU HOWEVER SOME FOR SOME REASON THE WAY HIS MOUTH WAS SUCH
OH NO SAID CHIEF SANDERS
BUT I FEEL LIKE I HAVE TO OR ELSE
DEN DENTIST
NO ONE HAD ANY
I'M SERIOUS STILL I'LL IT'S NOT A BAD
THEN HE PLAYED THE SONG THE
ROOSTER JOHN
DOCTOR WONG WAS THE WAS THE TOWN HERO THE FLUTE SOUNDED NORMAL AND IT TURNED TO
EVERYBODY LOOKED REALLY SILLY AT DANCES DANCING TO MUSIC THEY COULDN'T HEAR
THEN THEY DECIDE TO LOWER HIM DOWN
LOOK JOHN YOU'LL HEAR I'VE HEARD YOU PLAY THE CLARINET YOU'RE QUITE GOOD WHY DON'T YOU PLAY THAT INSTEAD SAID CHIEF SANDERS
A
SO THERE WAS A PROBLEM IN THE LITTLE TOWN OF FRANKSVILLE
ESPECIALLY SHAPED FOR JOHN'S MOUTH THEN PERHAPS HE COULD PLAY A FLUTE NORMALLY
BESIDES EVERYBODY LOVED JOHN
SO THEY DECIDE THAT JOHN COULD PLAY THE FLUTE AND EVERYBODY ELSE WOULD HAVE TO WEAR EARPLUGS
THEIR PROBLEMS STARTED WHEN THEY RAN OUT OF WATER THANKFULLY SOMEONE WAS DIGGING A HOLE AND FOUND WATER
WE CAN'T YET WE CAN'T LET YOU PLAY THE FLUTE ANYMORE JOHN SAID POLICE CHIEF S SAID POLICE CHIEF SANDERS
KEPT ON PLAYING HIS FLUTE THE FLIES WERE ANNOYING SO HE WOULD
THE FLIES WERE ANNOYING HE COULD NOT HE WOULD SWAT AT THEM WITH HIS HANDS OR OR EVEN HIS NEW FLUTE
OR ELSE BAD THINGS WILL HAPPEN
HE WAS A EXCELLENT DENTIST BUT HIS REAL LOVE WAS MUSIC HE PLAYED MANY MUSIC MUSICAL INSTRUMENTS SUCH AS GUITAR THE TUBA THE PIANO
THEN PRETTY SOON TON TONS OF FLIES WERE LANDING ON EVERYONE
CAVITIES AND NO ONE HAD ANY CAVITIES
IT WAS THEN THAT THE PEOPLE OF FRANKSVILLE REALIZED THAT THEY WOULD HAVE TO TAKE A GOOD
THE LOCAL SCIENTIST DOCTOR WONG CA CAME UP WITH AN IDEA HE THOUGHT THAT IF HE MADE A NEW MOUTHPIECE
IT'S NOT AS BAD AS MILLIONS OF FLEAS I SUPPOSE
THE POLICE CHIEF HATED THE SOUND SO MUCH THAT HE THREW JOHN IN JAIL
NO NO PLEASE DON'T PLAY YOUR OLD FLUTE BEGGED DOCTOR WONG
THEN THE FLEAS STOPPED BUT JUST THEN A MAN MOVED INTO THE TOWN WHO PLAYED A FLUTE A FLUTE SO BADLY THAT PEOPLE WOULD RUN AWAY SCREAMING
AND IT TURNED OUT JOHN COULD PLAY IT IT QUITE WELL
A WELL AND LET HIM PLAY DOWN WHERE YOU WHERE NO ONE COULD HEAR HIM
GOOD WITH THE BAD BECAUSE SO BAD AS THE FLUTE SOUNDED IT WAS A LOT BETTER THAN THOUSANDS OF FLIES CRAWLING ALL OVER THEM
THAT SOUND THAT SHOULD THAT THEY SHOULD DO THAT
AND GUESS WHAT IT WORKED DOCTOR
WELL I'M SURE YOU GUESSED THAT I DIDN'T THAT THAT DIDN'T WORK NOBODY COULD HEAR ANYTHING PEOPLE WERE GETTING INTO CAR ACCIDENTS AND
BUT I HAVE TO PLAY I WAS BORN I WAS BORN TO DO IT I DON'T KNOW WHY
SWAT AT THEM WITH HIS HANDS OR
HE WAS A NEW TOWN
WERE MUCH WHITER THEN AND CLEANER THEN
IT WAS GROSS THEN SUDDENLY THE FLIES FELL FLEW AWAY FA FAST AS THEY COULD
THAT'S HOW THE FLUTE SOUNDS WHEN THE GUY WHEN THIS GUY PLAYED IT
FROM THEN ON JOHN WOULD WAKE UP THE SUN AT SUNRISE WITH LIKE A ROOSTER AND PLAY TO KEEP THE FLIES AWAY
THEY SNATCHED HER PURSE AND RAN
HE WAS BRUCE WAYNE THE WEALTHIEST MAN IN GOTHAM CITY
JUST IN THE NICK OF TIME
DICK FOLLOWED THE STAIRS DOWN TO THE DARKNESS
AN INSTANT LATER HE FELT HIMSELF BEING YANKED UP
THEY RAN H THEN HE RAN OUT INTO THE STREET AND JUMPED INTO A NEARBY MANHOLE BATMAN FOLLOWED HIM
STONE AND STEEL BEGAN TO RAIN ON BATMAN AND THE GROUND BENEATH HIS FEET COLLAPSED BATMAN FELT HIM SINKING
TWO FACE'S WEAPON SENT A BALL OF FIRE HURTLING TOWARD BATMAN
ALL RIGHT FOLKS THIS IS AN OLD FASHIONED STICK UP
OH NO ONE OF THE HOODS SCREAMED IT'S BATMAN
BATMAN AND ROBIN SAID BATMAN I LIKE THE SOUND OF THAT
THE RIDDLER DECIDED THAT TWO FACE WOULD MAKE A PERFECT PARTNER IN CRIME
YOU THOUGHT YOU WERE ON MY
YOU'LL CRASH THE PARTY AND ROB THE GUESTS WHEN BATMAN ARRIVES TO STOP YOU HE'LL WALK RIGHT INTO OUT TRAP
AND THERE WAS THE BATMOBILE
FROM THEN ON BATMAN AND ROBIN WOULD BE PARTNERS TRACKING DOWN TWO FACE THE RIDDLER AND EVERY OTHER CRIMINAL IN GOTHAM CITY
WHENEVER CRIMINALS TRIED TO BREAK THE LAW BATMAN WAS THERE TO STOP THEM
BUT JUST BEFORE BATMAN'S HEAD DISAPPEARED BELOW THE SAND
THEY WORKED SO QUICKLY NO ONE COULD KEEP UP WITH THEM
LATER BATMAN SAID I TOLD YOU NO CRIME FIGHTING
IT COULD ONLY MEAN ONE THING BRUCE WAYNE WAS BATMAN
HIS GANG MEMBERS WERE SO BUSY ROBBING EVERYONE THEY DIDN'T NOTICE BRUCE WAYNE SLIP SLIP OUT OF THE ROOM
IN ANOTHER PART OF A CR ANOTHER P IN ANOTHER PART OF TOWN A CRIMINAL GENIUS CALLED THE RIDDLER WAS ALSO PLOTTING AGAINST HIM
INSTANTLY HIS COSTUME WAS COVERED IN A FIRE PROOF COATING
DICK WAS AN ORPHAN AND NEEDED A PLACE TO LIVE
IT WAS TWO FACE CARRYING SOME KIND OF WEAPON
TWO FACE WAS ONE OF THE CRIMINALS BATMAN HAD NOT YET ER HAD NOT CAUGHT YET
DICK COULDN'T BELIEVE HIS EYES HE WAS INSIDE THE BATCAVE
UP AND OUT OF THE PIT
THEN TWO FACE WALKED AWAY
DOWN DOWN DO DOWN DOWN BATMAN SANK
TWO FACE AND HIS GANG COMMITTED CRIMES ALL OVER GOTHAM CITY
THE RIDDLER TRACKED DOWN TWO FACE AND MADE AN OFFER TWO FACE DECIDED TO FLIP A COIN
BUT IT WAS A TRAP TWO FACE POINTED HIS WEAPON AT BATMAN AND FIRED
THE FOLLOWING NIGHT TWO FACE ARRIVED AT THE PARTY RIGHT ON SCHEDULE
LOOK ONE OF THE CROOKS SHOUTED THAT AIN'T BATMAN THAT'S JUST A KID WE CAN TAKE HIM EASY
WHEN THEY LAUNCH LAUNCHED A CRIME SPREE BATMAN WOULD SWOOP OUT OF THE SKY ON HIS BATROPE OR ROAR DOWN THE STREET IN HIS BATMOBILE
A GREEN GLOW HAD REACHED HIM HAD REACHED FOR HIM
LATE ONE NIGHT DICK WENT SEARCHING FOR A CLUE
DICK ASKED BATMAN WH AS THEY DROVE BACK TO WAYNE MANOR
I THINK IT'S TIME WE BECAME PARTNERS SINCE I JUST SAVED YOUR LIFE
MEANWHILE ACROSS TOWN A GANG GANG OF THUGS HAD SPOTTED A WOMAN WALKING DOWN THE LONELY STREETS OF GOTHAM CITY
AN INSTANT LATER A CAR CAME SCREECHING
DICK SMILED
BRUCE OFT OFTEN HELPED PEOPLE ONE DAY HE MET A YOUNG CIRCUS ACROBAT NAMED DICK GRAYSON
BUT BATMAN WOULD SOON NEED HELP
THE MANHOLE LED INTO AN ABANDONED SUBWAY TUNNEL IN THE DIM LIGHT BATMAN COULD SEE SOMEONE WAS COMING TOWARD HIM
YOU'LL BE OKAY NOW DICK TOLD THE WOMAN
HE DISCOVERED AN UNDERGROUND CAVERN FILLED WITH CRIME FIGHTING EQUIPMENT
WHAT'S THE PLAN
I EXPECT YOU'LL BE BURIED ALIVE TWO FACE S S TWO FACE SAID AS BATMAN SANK DEEPER I'D LOVE TO STAY AND SEE YOU OFF BUT CRIME'S A WASTIN' AND I'M A VERY BUSY MAN
ACTING QUI QUICKLY BATMAN PRESSED A BUTTON ON HIS UTILITY BELT
BATMAN FOREVER
TWO FACE SMILED
HIT HIM FULL BLAST BUT BATMAN WAS PROTECTED
YOU THOUGHT YOU WERE ON MY TRAIL TWO FACE SNARLED
WHY CAN'T WE FIGHT FIGHT CRIME TOGETHER
THE HOODLUMS KNEW THEY WERE NO MATCH FOR BATMAN BUT WHEN THE TOP OF THE BATMOBILE OPENED THEY WERE SURPRISED TO SEE A YOUNG MAN
DICK LIKED LIVING IN THE MANSION BUT HE WONDERED WHERE BRUCE WENT EVERY DAY EVERY EVENING
BATMAN WAS ONLY THE WAS THE ONL WAIT KAY BATMAN WAS ONLY ONE MAN TO STOP TWO FACE HE WOULD NEED HELP
AREN'T YOU GLAD I DIDN'T LISTEN DICK ANSWERED
CAME TO A SCREECHING HALT IN FRONT OF THEM IT WAS NO ORDINARY CAR IT WAS THE BATMOBILE
MY FOLKS USED TO SAY I FLEW LIKE A BIRD ON THE FLYING TRAPEZE SO THEY CALLED ME ROBIN
THE BALL OF FLAME HIT
WHILE THE RIDDLER HAD THE BRAINS TO OUTWIT BATMAN HE DIDN'T HAVE THE MUSCLE TO FINISH HIM
THEN A HAND GRABBED HIM AND HE WAS TOSSED INTO THE BATMOBILE IT WAS BATMAN AND HE WAS ANGRY
TOMORROW NIGHT ALL OF GOTHAM'S RICHEST PEOPLE WILL BE AT A BIG PARTY THE RIDDLER EXPLAINED
BATMAN WAS THE GREATEST CRIME FIGHTER IN GOTHAM CITY
I'M FINISHED HE THOUGHT THERE'S NO WAY TO ESCAPE
BRUCE INVITED DICK TO STAY IN WAYNE MANOR
IT WAS DICK HE HAD FOLLOWED BATMAN
BEGIN PHASE TWO HE WHISPERED TO HIS GANG
MEANWHILE THE EXPLOSIVE FIREBALL SHATTERED THE TUNNEL WALLS
IF IT COMES HEAD IF IT COMES UP HEADS WE'LL JOIN FORCES HE EXPLAINED THE COIN HIT THE GROUND LANDING HEADS UP
BUT DICK QUICKLY PROVED THEM WRONG HE HAD SPENT YEARS TRAINING AS AN ACROBAT HE LEAPED AND DIVED DIVED ABOUT KICKING AND PUNCHING THEN STUNNED THE THUGS IN NO TIME HE HAD KNOCKED THEM ALL OUT
HE DISCOVERED A SECRET DOOR THAT LED TO A FLIGHT OF STAIRS
OKAY PARTNER WE HAVE A DEAL TWO FACE SAID
WHEN HE WASN'T FIGHTING CRIME BATMAN HAD A SEC BAT YEAH BATMAN HAD A SECRET IDENTITY
YOU'RE TOO YOUNG BATMAN ANSWERED BESIDES BATMAN FIGHTS ALONE
EASY MONEY THE HOODS SNEERED AS THEY CREPT UP ALONGSIDE HER
OKAY BATMAN SAID YOU'VE EARNED IT BUT WHAT ARE WE GOING TO CALL YOU
HE TOLD HIS PARENTS I DON'T WANT ANY OF THESE GIFTS I WANT TO RETURN THEM ALL AND TRY TO FIND A NEW PERFECT HAT INSTEAD
AND ON HIS HEAD ONCE HE EVEN IMAGINED HIMSELF AS A GROWN UP WEARING THE HAT AND SPEAKING IN FRONT OF MANY PEOPLE
CLEAN AND PERFECT FOREVER

HE KNEW CRYING WOULDN'T HELP MAKE THE HAT PERFECT AGAIN BUT HE CRIED ANYWAY
SINCERELY DANNY
ACTUALLY THE TRUTH IS THAT I I BY ACCIDENT TURNED ON THE NOSE HAIR CLIPPER
ALSO I WAS GOING TO SELL THE CAT FUR TO BUY MY SISTER'S JENNY BRACES FOR HER BIG STUPID FACE
IT'S YOUR FAULT REALLY DAD PLEASE DON'T READ THE NEXT PART
DIDN'T MEAN SHE'S REALLY RESPONSIBLE
I SHOULD HAVE
CATS AREN'T AREN'T ALWAYS NICE JUST LIKE MY SISTER JENNY ISN'T ALWAYS NICE
AND DID STUPID THINGS THAT'S THE LAST TIME I SHAVE THE CAT TO PROTECT ANY STUPID GERBILS
PLUS I FORGOT TO TELL YOU THAT YOU SHOULD BE BLAMING MS CASPER MY SCIENCE TEACHER
SO IT WAS REALLY MY FATHER'S DAY GIFT TO HIM
SO IN CONCLUSION I'M GETTING HUNGRY AND SORRY FOR SHAVING THE CAT
FOR THINKING SO FAST ON MY TOES
I WAS AFRAID TO TELL YOU THE R REALLY RE THE REALLY REASON I SHAVED THE CAT WAS THAT I WANT TO BE A BARBER I NEED PRACTICE
THOSE POOR HAIR LESS CATS THAT WE SAW ON TV ON THE ANIMAL CHANNEL
BUT SO WHAT IF IT'S WINTER I MEAN IT'LL BE SUMMER SOON ENOUGH AND I JUST WANTED THE CAT TO GET USED TO THE IDEA BEFORE IT GOT REALLY HOT
IF SHE IF I HAD A CAT I WOULD TEACH HER HOW TO NOT I WOULD TO NOT SHAVE ITSELF THAT'S FOR SURE
YOU COULD TAKE HER ON TV SHOWS AND GET LOTS OF MONEY SO THAT YOU CAN SEND JENNY TO COLLEGE EVEN IF SHE IS DUMB LI IS A DUMB LITTLE TATTLE TALE
I COULDN'T BUY HIM ANYTHING NICE SINCE IT TOOK AWAY MY ALLOWANCE FOR WHEN I SHAVED THE NEIGHBOR'S DOG
OK
I KEPT SAYING NO KITTY NO DON'T SHAVE YOURSELF
I KNOW HOW MUCH YOU HATE HIM ANY ALWAYS SNEEZING AND STUFF
YOU SHOULD BE PROUD OF ME
I THINK SH SHE SHOULD BRUSH H T BRUSH HER TEETH TWICE TONIGHT THATS JUST MY OPINION THOUGH
BUT THE REALEST REASON I SHAVED MY SHAVED THE CAT WAS TO MAKE A WIG FOR
I JUST DIDN'T WANT TO SEE THE CAT GETTING ALL HOT AND UNCOMFORTABLE AND STUFF
BUT MY STUPID SISTER NEVER TAUGHT HER CAT HOW TO LISTEN SO SHE JUST IGNORED ME
SHE SAID THAT WHEN WE SHAVE A CAT A LOT OF A BUNCH OF TIMES HER HAIR WOULD GROW BACK HARDER EACH TIME AND SOON
I COULDN'T HELP IT ANYWAYS IT WAS AN ACCIDENT AND I DIDN'T EVEN DO IT ON PURPOSE
I SAW THAT THE CAT WAS TRYING T TO GET THE GERBILS AND YOU TOLD US WE COULDN'T HIT ANIMALS SO WHAT SO I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT ELSE TO DO
THEY JUST RAN ON THAT STUPID WHEEL
SINCE YOU HAVE GROUNDED ME AND TOLD ME TO WRITE DOWN WHY I AM SORRY BEFORE I WAS ALLOWED OUT OF MY ROOM I AM MAD AT YOU
OH SURE IT'S EASY TO SAY THAT I SHOULD HAVE JUST PICKED UP THE CAT BUT THOSE STUPID GERBILS DIDN'T EVEN THANK ME
I PROMISE I'LL DO A BETTER JOB THEN I DID ON THE CAT CAUSE NOW I HAVE WHAT DAD CALLS LIFE EXPERIENCE
THEY ARE CALL CALLED HAIRLESS CATS
THE ONLY REASON IT HASN'T COME OUT FOR TWO WEEKS IS BECAUSE YOU GUYS MADE SUCH A BIG DEAL ABOUT IT
FINE OSCAR CAN'T REALLY TALK BUT IF HE COULD HE WOULD HAVE SAID PLEASE SHAVE THE CAT
JUST CAUSE SHE'S A GOOD STUDENT DIDN'T MEAN SHE'S DOESN'T
HOW COME JENNY GETS A CAT AND I GET A STUPID TURTLE ANYWAY
AND THE CAT WAS BEING CHASED BY THE TURTLE THAT RAN RIGHT BY THE CLIPPERS AND SHAVED HERSELF
DEAR MOM WANT DAD KNOW THAT THE REAL REASON I SHAVED THE CAT WAS THAT HE'S REALLY SNEEZE SNEEZING AROUND
THE CAT LIKED BEING SHAVED ANYWAY SO IT DIDN'T IT DO I DON'T SEE THE BIG
CAN I GET A DOG
LAST NIGHT I SAW THAT SHE DIDN'T BRUSH HER TEETH OH YEAH I FORGOT TO TELL YOU YOU THAT
DEAR MOM AND DAD JENNY DIDN'T BRUSH HER TEETH LAST NIGHT
BESIDES THE REAL REASON I SHAVED THE CAT WAS TO KEEP IT NICE AND COOL
TO MAKE ME DO THIS BECAUSE I WA IT WASN'T EVEN MY FAULT
SHE MADE US SHAVE SOME SOMETHING FOR SCIENCE ASK HER
HERES WHAT HAPPENED AS I REMEMBER IT
DEAR MOM AND DAD
I WAS AFRAID YOU WOULDN'T LET ME PRACTICE ON MY OWN HEAD CAN I CAN PRACTICE BY SHAVING JENNY'S HEAD
PS IF YOU WOULD HAVE BROUGHT HER A A TURTLE I COULD'VE SHAVED IT
I THINK IT REALLY LIKED IT'S HAIRCUT
I KNEW OUR CAT WOULD GROW HER FUR BACK BUT SOME CATS DON'T HAVE HAIR
I DON'T HAVE A GOOD GET I DON'T HAVE TO GET GOOD GRADES TO KNOW THAT YOU SHOULD TEACH A CAT TO SHAVE ITSELF
PLUS OSCAR MY TURTLE TOLD ME TO SHAVE THE CAT
SHE'S SO GOOD AT SCHOOL AND YOU BOUGHT HER A CAT CAUSE SHE'S SO RESPONSIBLE AND STUFF
SO I THOUGHT I'D GET RID OF HIS FUR HE WOULDN'T SNEEZE AND THAT YOU WOULD HAVE A BETTER MARRIAGE
I DON'T SEE THE BIG DEAL
GET A DOG PLEASE
I BET YOU DIDN'T KNOW SOMETHING ELSE DID YOU KNOW I WANTED TO BE A BARBER
I THINK
SHE SHE'S NOT SO RESPONSIBLE AFTER ALL
YOU GUYS WILL JUST PROBABLY SAY IT'S WINTER DANNY CATS DON'T OVERHEAT IN WINTER
I REALLY DIDN'T MEAN TO SH SHAVE THE CAT REALLY I SWEAR I SWEAR
SO I GRABBED DAD'S NOSE HAIR CLIPPERS AND SHAVED IT
YOU WOULDN'T ALWAYS TAKE THE CAT'S SIDE IF YOU KNEW THE STUFF HE DID TO MY POOR TURTLE
I WOULD LIKE TO START BY SAYING THAT I THINK THAT YOU ARE VERY MEAN
NOT THAT I SHAVED THE CAT THOUGH
SHAVED IT
POOR KITTY THIS AND POOR KITTY THAT
THEY NEED F FUR IN THE WINTER BECAUSE I TH THINK I SWEAR THAT'S THE REASON
PLUS IF IT WEREN'T ANYWAYS CUDDLING WITH MY SISTER SO MUCH MAYBE MAYBE SHE WOULD HAVE BEEN ENOUGH
IF IT KEEPS HITTING ME ON THE SHELL AND TRYING TO ROLL ME OVER WHEN I LEAVE THE ROOM YOU GUYS YOU GUYS NEVER LIKED OSCAR AS MUCH AS THE CAT ANYWAY
TURTLES DON'T DO ANYTHING EXCEPT POKE THEIR HEADS OUT AND BE NOT CUDDLY
ONE DAY JUSTIN AND HIS MOTHER WENT SHOPPING FOR HATS AND HIS
