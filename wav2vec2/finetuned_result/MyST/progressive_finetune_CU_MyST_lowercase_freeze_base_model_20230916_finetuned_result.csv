1,we learned about parallel and series circuits,we learned about parelell and ceryo circets
2,they go out too,they go out t
3,it won't go out because that is still a parallel circuit oh not it's not sorry,it won't go out because that is still a pairlittle curcet oh kno it's not so
4,what is a string of light,what is t  grean of le
5,uhm it is still a circuit because uhm one side is both sides are connected so if one goes out then the other one stays lit,um it is still a circet because m one side is fully both sides are connected so if one goes out then the other on stays lit
6,it doesn't go out because that's a parallel circuit so it is still working,it doesn't go out because that's a parelell circet so it is still work
7,good hi,good hi
8,okay,okat
9,we're learning about magnetism and electricity,we are running about magnatisom and electrisity
10,it goes on,it goes on
11,it is still going on one side,it is still going on one side
12,uhm the one if one goes out it's a series so if one goes out the other one goes out,um the one if one goes out it's a steries so if one goes at the other one gos out
13,when one goes out the other one goes out too,when one gos out the other one gos out t
14,it stops the flow of electricity,it stops the flow of alectrisity
15,the other one goes out,theother one goes ou
16,parallel lights,parrellell like
17,the rest the rest go out,the rest blo the rest go out
18,uhm one light is out but the other one is is still going,um one light is out but the other one is bir is still goin
19,i see that it turns on,i see that it turns on
20,uhm one side of the one side of the uhm both sides are parallel so they both go through the energy does,one side of the one side of the umboth sides are parlells so they both go through the energit us
21,it is a circuit but the uhm it isn't flowing because the switch is off,it is a circet but the und it isn't flowing because the swish is off
22,uhm they're still connected to the bulb it's still a circuit with all of them,um they wre still conected to the bull bits still a circete with all them
23,because it's using the same wires and they're both only in one circuit,because using the same wires and they're both only in one circet
24,a conductor carries the electricity around,a conductor carries the ecletriscity arou
25,the object is uhm can not have,that object is um cannot have
26,good,good
27,it doesn't spin,it doesn't spin
28,the metal uhm there is a circuit uhm with flowing energy which is making the motor spin,the meddal um there is a circut um with flowing energy which is making the moter bin
29,uhm it is a metal,um it is neil
30,so they're not dangerous to touch,so is not dangerous to touch
31,they are metal,they are meddle
32,learning about uhm electricity,learning about um electricy
33,uhm the the uhm the stick can't have electricity running through it,ilum the the um the stick can't have electrisity running through it
34,some objects uhm let the motor spin because they're metal and they complete the they are conductors and they complete the circuit,some objects um le the motors spin cause thei'r mettal and they compleet the they are conductors and they complet the circet
35,uhm if you uhm some objects are metal and are conductors so the energy can flow through them into the switch,um if you um some objects are medtal ind are conductors so the energy can flow through them into the swish
36,uhm the electricity can't flow through the object that is an insulator uhm it can't complete the circuit the energy just stops,um the lectrisity can't flow through the object that is an incelater um it can't compleeat the circut the ennergige stops
37,uhm they help they let electricity flow through the circuit smoothly,um they helpd they let electricity flow through the circet smoothly

54,this might be because i turned on i turn i turned the switch on and that lit the light,this might be because i turned on i turne i did i turned the switch on and that lit the light
55,this is a series one when one light bulb goes out the other one doesn't,this is a sceries wen when one like bal goes out the other one doesn't
56,i notice that when i turn out a light bulb the other one doesn't,oi noticed that when i turn out a light ball the other one does
57,i notice that i clicked on one but the other two didn't go out,i noticed that i clicked on one but the other two didn't go out
58,there are two light bulbs one light bulb one light bulb burned out so the other one burned out too,there are two lihte bolbs one like ballone like ball burned down so the other one burned out two

867,the water's expanding and breaking the,the waters expanding and breaking the g
868,because um when they go down the stream they get tossed around and it wears off their edges,because um when they go down the stream they get toss around and it wears off their edge
869,they were a rock top tossed around and they their edges curved and they went got smaller and smaller,they were ro ttossed around and they their edges cuarved and they wen got smaller and smaller
870,well it expands and it breaks the rock open,wll it expands and it breaks the rock open
871,the ones on the right,the ones on the right
872,it's breaking the glass,it's breaking the glass
873,the frozen water is getting into the cracks the frozen water is getting into the cracks,the frozen water is getting into the cracksthe frozen water is getting into the cracks
874,good oh yeah,d aga
875,we've been learning about rocks land forms and soil,wie lug roclan foms in the sol la
876,we learned about the mineral properties table two,we learned about the minirl propertys table too
877,something that well like a mineral text testing oh a mineral testing,um something that wil like a minral tex testing oh a mineral testin
878,trying to figure out what rock you have,trying to figure out what rock you have

882,good,g
883,water,water
884,we could leave we could leave it out for a while,we could leave we can see it out for a whi
885,we've been learning about like products and stuff and like mixtures,we've ben learning about like prodduct said stuff and like mixtur
886,well the things that you put into the bag made made the,lum um the things that you put into the bag made made the
887,well the gas is releasing and it's puffing up the bag,bull the gass is releacing and it's puffing up the ba
888,bags are blowing up,bags are blowing
889,your mixing salt with water,you make things salt with water
890,well there's two cups of salt and it fizzed when they put the water in and i do not know what's important about it,well um there's two cups salt and it fized once thy put the water in and i do not know what'sfor gat it
891,because when the bag that is open the air goes out the gas and it doesn't weigh a thing,because when the bag that is ben up the air gos out the gass and it doesn't waigh to t
892,don't,don
893,you can see a volcano,you can see evoca
894,well we did the same experiment and the bag blew up,well wai did the same experiment and the bad blew up
895,good,good
896,i don't know i wasn't listening,i don't know i wasn't mesnam
897,the bag that is open weighs less than the bag that is closed weighs more the gas just floated out,the bag gi is open waed less in the bag that is closed made waite more the guess just floated ou
898,i don't know i don't know but i have to go,i don't havei don't know but i have to g
899,that the salt weighs more the cup weighs more when you add salt to it,that the salt waves more the cup waes more when you have sault to
900,that there's that there is still some stuff product on the bottom,that there is that there is till some stuff proh uon the bottom
901,a mixture,a mixture
902,the solution,this elusion
903,that the water is disappearing,that the water is disappeari
904,um well maybe we could use a grid or oh i know what we could is we could let it evaporate,m well maybe we could use a grat roh i know what we could do is we could let it up that rate
905,to be left out in the sun and the sun absorbs the water,it to be left out in the sun and the sun absorbs the water
906,yes yes we do know that,yes yes we new know that
907,um i think the maybe solution lots and lots of solution,um i think the maybe sillution tots i lots of sallution
908,the solvent,the salvent
909,people are adding water sand into a cup and water salts into a cup with water,people are ating water tand into a cup and water saults into a cup with water
910,that the thing you mix doesn't always disappear and never comes back it's still in there but it you can just can't see but it's adding weight to the cup,that' the thing you maks doesn't always dissappeare and never comes back it's still in there but it you can just can't see it but it's still adding wait to the cup
911,sorry about the mixture i meant it was a solution it's a solution,sir about the mixture i ment it was a sallution it's a salution
912,solution,that mrins are seluti
913,um i see that it's a mixture it's a definite mixture,h i see that it's a mixture isa deponat mixture
914,yes probably,yes probabably
915,i have to do a separating solution because that's how can you can separate solution it's evaporating water i just told you that,bight ave you do with supper yu cause that's how you can clipperates with tem its af aptwats e themwi
916,it's growing bigger and,it's growing bigger and bi
917,uh maybe its role is to dissolve into so it makes a solution,um maybe the roller to desolve  s so it makes a selluion
918,i notice that it's still gaining pounds when you put in the,i noticed that it's still ganing pounds when you put in the
919,a solution,a sellution
920,good,good
921,we've learned about evaporation mixtures solutions weights and about how things make solutions and mixtures and yeah,we've learned about vabborations mixtures sellutions waits and about how things make slutions and mixtures and yea
922,tells you that when you mix stuff it's,telld you that when you mixkd uf fins like v
923,um i think it's like the solution,um i think it's like th so luca
924,it's evaporating,it's evappirating
925,uh i don't know,h i don't know
926,well um since it's in the water what you do with some of them you could probably go away you could probably um get them evaporated and i didn't mean to say go away,well um since it's in the water what you coud do is some of them you could probabble go awa you can probabbly um kept them evapporated and i didn't mean to say go away
927,been learning about mixtures and solutions i'm not that good at them though,fen learning about mixtuares and serens anot tat gt at them t
928,well um the salt it dissolves into the water and it's in the water now and the sand mixed and it's on the bottom because it went down to the bottom,the asalt it doesulved intte water and it's in the water now and the sand mixed and it's on the bottom because it went down to th bottom
929,a mixture because the solution goes into the water,a mixture because the sallution goes into he wat
930,well it's the same but when you add it it changes with all the plussed weight and stuff like that,well it's the same but when you addet it changes with ald puss wait stof like that
931,i notice that um it didn't get stuck and it went through and cause it dissolved into the water and went straight,i noticed that um it didn't get stuck and it went through and cause it desolved into the water and went straight
932,erosion and deposition,rosian in deposition

939,erosion,afrozen
940,well it's where a flood start i mean a canyon is formed,well it's weare a flud sta i mean a canyon is formed
941,i think it spread out and made a delta,am i think it spread out and hmade a deltar
942,yes,yes

956,i don't know,i don't know
957,what happens over time when water comes down,what happens over time when water comes d
958,erosion is where something hits another of something and it makes it smoother and it breaks down,arotian is where um something hits another of something and it makes it smoother and it breakes d
959,they're formed when it hits the bottom of a,um they're formed when it hitsd the bottom of river in it

968,well i'm thinking that maybe water came through to hollow it out to look like a valley deeper,from whelle i'm thinking at maybe water came through to hollow it out to lok qicka valley deeper
969,water running through them,water running throghthem
970,a water comes through and carves it out over years and years,the water comes through and carves it out over ears and ea
971,we've learned about deposition,we've learned about depposition
972,i think it's the piece of rock that formed on the lake when it hit the surface when it hits and it goes in the alluvial,um i think it's the piece of rock that form on the lake when it hits the curface when it hits and it goes nto the oweel
973,erosion,arosion
974,how our regular rain forms cause it's a standard condition,ow are regular rain forms cause it's the standerd conditon
975,a canyon,canyin
976,it's some of what clay sand soil is made of,it's sumof what clay is sa soil is mad
977,we've been talking about land forms soil rocks,we've been talking about landforms soil rocks
978,they're from different areas,theyre from different area
979,well um they're different places it might be like the delta or the desert,well um there different places it might be like the delta or the desert
980,well it's separating into different layers,well it's sepporating into different layers
981,humus gravel clay and silt,humis gravil clay in su
982,um they're mixed around and they are making them sand,on thei're mixed around and they are making u m
983,some of them have stuff floating up above and they all are different layers and have sand silt gravel pebbles so,some of them have stuff floating up above and they all are different layers and have san sill grabbl pebblesm
984,there's different stuff in the soil,there's different stuff in the sky
985,oh i don't know,i don't know
986,the mountains probably have more rocks or pebbles or gravel,the mountains probably have more rocks or pubbles or grable
987,um some of the humus and plants are going up to the top,um some of the humise and plant stuff are going up to the ta
988,they have different layers and different parts of soil in them they're formed differently and have different mixtures,they ave different layors in different parts of soil in them they're formed differently in of different mixtures
989,there is humus sand and pebbles and clay,there is humos sand and pebbiles and cla
990,they're settling on different layers,they are setdling on the layers
991,they're in different layers,tere in different lar
992,they are not all the same it depends on where they are because there's different materials there,they are not all the same  depends on where they are because there's different materiels the
993,the delta mountains and farmland are lifting up and the desert the desert is just on the,the del mountains in farm land wiptit up and the cosert the teter s the sum
994,we've been learning about density,we've been learning about dencity
995,they would float float,they would float float
996,it stays on top of the most concentrated one,it stays on top of the most concentrated
997,it'll float,it'll float
998,the less the one with sixty grams of salt went on the bottom and the one with sixteen went on top and they collided because the one the one that's more concentrated wanted to sink down to the bottom,the um less than the one os sixty grans of salt went o the bottom and th nt sixteen went on top and they colited because they ant he one that's mst concintrated wanted to sink downto the bottom
999,and in this one the one that's more concentrated with more salt stays on the bottom and the one with less floats on top,um and this one the one that's more s more ss at the bottom and the one with less close on top
1000,they stay on top of the more concentrated solutions,they stay on top of the concentrated lasins
1001,they sit on top of each other,they sit on top of each other
1002,the lower the one that is more concentrated sinks to the bottom and the one that's less can just float on top,the um lower the one thaat is more concntrated sinks to the bottom and that one's leg can just float on top
1003,one has more salt,one has more sault
1004,they sink,they think
1005,because with the one with the most solute then then it tries to sink down and it mixes with the one that has less solute,because with the one with the most sollut then then it tries to sink down and it mixes with the one that has less sall
1006,good good,g
1007,because you have the labels,because you have the lables
1008,it'll sink,it'll sink
1009,solution b must have watch this solution b must have more grams of salt,sulucin be must have watched this sellutin be must have more sgrans of salt
1010,well the one with blue solutions has twelve grams and the one with red has six and the one that's green is twelve,well the one with blueslucins has twelve grams and the one with red sluucin has stiks and the one it's green is tw
1011,it would be much more dense than the water that has is less concentrated,it would be much more dence than the one that ihas  less concentrate
1012,been dissolving rocks too,en desolving rocks t
1013,stuff i can't remember,stuff i can't rim
1014,well they had different amount of water,well they had toferent amount of water
1015,a slow process,a slow procee
1016,we have been doing land forms,we have been doing manforms

1021,well it is also much deeper it is lower in the stream,well it is also much deeper it is lower an the stream
1022,slow,slow
1023,i think this was very slow,um i think its was very slo
1024,the water that is flat is not going as fast and the water that is steep is going way fast fast fast,the water that is flat is not going ou fast in the water that is deep is going way fast fast fast
1025,they have different valuables,nthey have different vallue modle
1026,the water that is steep is moving much faster,um the water that is sdeep is moving much faster
1027,it starts to move faster,it searts to move faster
1028,it's,it' t rop up
1029,awesome,otome lamma
1030,a volcano erupted,a vocana ibrupted
1031,well the one with a slope has much more definition because it had more of an able to slide and no slope does not,wile the one with a sloape has much more definition because it had more of um inable to slide and nostoape dos no
1032,well in the flood source the water that's coming is faster and it's getting higher and higher,well in the fludsource um the water that's coming is faster and its getting higher and higher
1033,well the flood conditions has moved more and is creating more of a delta an alluvial fan then standard,well the flud conditions has moved more and itscreating more of a deltwhen you love you and in't stand
1034,i've been learning about land forms and stuff like that,as they ur about tsun the fam that sos ig the
1035,slow change,alow change
1036,quickly,quickly
1037,the one with the slope has gone farther and the one with no slope has gone not as far,um thes one with a slope has gone farther and the oneit no sloper has goneg ot to ai
1038,there's a lot of definition on the left side of the flood source it's happening more on the left on one side and standard is happening more in the middle,there is a lot of definition on the left side of the fledsource um its happening more on the left on one side and thstander is happening round ta middle
1039,a fast,a fa
1040,when it's moving it's going slower like i said,bt wen t smoothing i's going slower like a seid than e ta
1041,well the water in the normal source is going much not as fast as the flood source,well the water in the normal source is going much not as fast as the flit thors
1042,it fell off,it fell off
1043,slow,dwop
1044,by adding more water or less,by adding more water or less
1045,maybe by the color or how it tastes,maybe by color or hout case
1046,that one of them has more powder and the other one doesn't,that one of some has more poder and the other one doesn
1047,good,good
1048,i think it's more concentrated,i think it's more concentrated
1049,we don't know,we don't know
1050,because you don't have as much so it won't get as concentrated,because you don't have as much so it won't get as consentrated
1051,the color,umthe color
1052,it it's color,it's color
1053,adding more water,adding more water
1054,that is more diluted,dad is more delouded
1055,uh well you could evaporate it or taste it,well you could evabbirate it or tast et
1056,um one of them has more powerful stuff in it and the other one has less,um one of them has worne purple stuffin an the other one has a l
1057,a scale,ascale
1058,by adding more water,by adtin for water
1059,i don't know,i don't know
1060,stronger probably maybe yeah,stronger probably maybeye
1061,maybe not as strong like a less flavor like you can't,may maybe not a strong like a less flavort like you can't
1062,changing the number of water,changing the number of water
1063,well we're still doing mixtures and solutions and we're doing we're gonna figure out which one is concentrated,well we're still doing mixture the loand and woud wing work ing a figure out which one is concantrated
1064,maybe sweeter or stronger,maybe spieor onger
1065,the solution,the sallution
1066,it is slightly changing color and rusting away,it is slightly changing collor and resting aw
1067,kinda getting buried in sand over time,kind of getting burried ind sand overtime
1068,abrasion,abrsion
1069,physical weathering,pisical bothe
1070,well the weather made the rock crack which made all of this happen to get the rock in that way,well the weather made the rock crack which made all of this happen to get the rock in that way
1071,cause it is kind of wearing away some color and it is yeah,it it is ing a race of color and it is yea
1072,we've been learning about physical weathering soil rocks land forms abrasion,we've bee learning about pisical weatheringweathering soils axlanforms abrasion
1073,good how bout you,e happ y
1074,physical weathering,is i o te ing et
1075,maybe some air bubbles i don't know i don't know,be some airbubbles i don't rubbble i  no
1076,they are dissolving,they are desolvin
1077,the rocks in the water are reacting to the vinegar just like the statue,the rocks in the water are we acting to the vinigur just like the statchu
1078,when the water went into the crack it broke the rock open and it tumbled down the hill into smaller pieces and now it's rusting and getting sand all over it,when the water went into the crack it brok the rock open and it tumbled down the hill into smaller pieces and now it's rusting and getting sandal ver
1079,dissolving,desolving
1080,well the water is making it split apart so i think it's physical weathering,well the water is making it split apart so i think it's musical weather
1081,lime well we have been dissolving and figure out acid rain and figuring out why this stuff is happening,lime well we have been deolving and figure out ascied rain and figuring out why these stuffis happening
1082,the lime stone is effective to the vinegar and the,but the lime stone is affective to the vinigor ind the
1083,it's rotting,it's  roding
1084,when it was bumbling down the hill it was breaking up the rocks and it's the same um because we were shaking the rocks and walking it watching it go smaller and smaller,when it was bumbling down the hill it was breaking up the rocks and it's the ame um because we were shaking the rocks and walking it watching it go smaller and smaller
1085,were growing and broke into the rock,tuit were growing and broken to the rock
1086,when the sand stone was freezing it didn't really it kinda just cracked off in little pieces it didn't,when the sand stone was breezing it cdidn't really it kind as cracked off in little pieces it
1087,well it was and it was rocking down hitting against each other and getting smaller,well it was first raneant and it was rocking down hitting against ech other and geting smaller
1088,the lime stone is dissolving in the water and it's shrinking and the salt is not dissolving it,the lime stone is desoulving in the water and it's shrinking and sult is not desulving a
1089,we did the same experiment where the rocks dissolved and it's reacting to the rain just like rock was reacting to the vinegar,we did the same experiment whear the rocks desolved in its re acting to the ri rain just like the rock wasreacthe vigor
1090,um it had to do with the rain interacting um interacting with the limestone,um it has to do with the rain um interrupcting with the lime sto inset
1091,i skipped too far,mi skipt too far
1092,that the rock is dissolving,that the rock is desolveang
1093,they are all reactant,they are al re ac on
1094,don't know,don't know
1095,the two reactants made a product a chemical reaction product the product,the two reactions made a produa camical reaction r thathe prodoct
1096,good,good
1097,reactant,the activity
1098,they were making chemical reaction where it was bubbling,um they were making a kemical reaction where it was bubling
1099,when you put the two reactants in it's fizzing,um when you put the tw re acting ans it's fising
1100,maybe they,hum maybe they
1101,yes because they they're just like humans and humans need air to breathe,yese because they um they're just like humans and humans need air to breath
1102,no and well when you ask me if plants will need food if we didn't have food if we would be missing something and not all plants need food,no um and will when you ask me if plants wi'll need food if um we didn't have food if we would be missing something and not all plants need food
1103,yes,yes
1104,well the plant this plant has all sun that it needs all air that it needs and all water that it needs which some which the other plants didn't have all of those put this one does so it's healthy,um well the plant this plant has all un that it needs all air that needs in all water that needs which some which the other plants didn't have all of those but this one does so it's healthy
1105,sometimes it starts from a producer,sometimes mlims it starts from a producer
1106,well you need a plant and a food web,well um you need a plant in a food rub
1107,yes,yes
1108,it doesn't have enough sun,it doesn't have enough son
1109,well not all plants need water to survive,well not all plants need water to survive
1110,that they're sleeping,that they're sleeping
1111,good,go
1112,yes,yes
1113,well it's green and not dead but it is also it's also down because it doesn't have any enough water to grow more,well it's green and not dead but it also it's also down because it doesn't have any enough water to grow more
1114,that yeast is tiny and they're they need to move around,that yeast is um tiny and there um they need to move around
1115,because for because fertilizer can produce water,because fr because virtaliers firtaliser can um produce water
1116,like from people or other plants maybe and maybe just by itself,like from m people or other plants maybe and maybe just by itself
1117,food,food
1118,they they do make their food and they get it from the energy that they get from the sun and the water and the oxygen,they um they do make their food and they get it from the ennergy that they get from the sun in the water in the oxygen
1119,as it it doesn't have enough air,cause it it doesn't have enough  air
1120,this is like a dead plant,is like a dead plant
1121,this plant is healthy and has enough water air and sun,this plant is healtthy and has enough water air and son
1122,well that is wind sometimes a plant sometimes needs that but doesn't always need that,well that is um hwind which sometimes the plant sometimes need that but doesn't always need that
1123,sunlight and water,sunlight in water
1124,it doesn't have enough water,it doesn't have enough water
1125,well a plant needs air for oxygen,will a plant needs air for oxygen
1126,the soil,the soil
1127,so it can start so because like we need water and food to stay active and so does the yeast,u so it can um start so because like we need water in food to stay active and so does theas
1128,yes,ges
1129,the plants need to the sun also,the plants need um the sun also
1130,well we did a project just like this with yeast animal crackers and water,well we did um a project just like this with east animal carkers and water
1131,yes because the the plant needs water to survive and have moisture,syes because the um the plant needs water to survive and have moistur
1132,that you need,that um you needs
1133,it's a house,it's a house
1134,this one is dead and brown,this one is dead and brown
1135,they also need food to grow,they also need food to grow
1136,they don't need juice because they should already have water,they don't need us because they aready should have water
1137,that it's healthy and it has all that it needs to live,that it's healthy and umn has all that it needs to live
1138,well because plants need sun to live,well because plants need som to live
1139,well if a bunny were to eat the grass,well if a bunney were to eat the grass
1140,it's showing that there's air and the roots and the food and the sun,it's showing that there's air and the roots and the food in the sun that's helping the plant gr
1141,that's the sun,that's the sun
1142,because it has everything it needs,because it has everything it needs
1143,yes because plants are a living system and just like us we are a living system too and we also need air to breathe,yes because plants are living sistom and just like us we are living sistom toon we also need air to breathe
1144,juice,juce
1145,that it's a living system and it needs food and water to get active,that it's the living sistom a it needs food and water to get active
1146,well not always,well not always
1147,they well the yeast is a living thing and,thewle the yeast is a living thing
1148,no because it already has air and water which is most important and the sun,kno because it already has air ind water which is most important and the sun
1149,about living systems,about living sistoms
1150,like that's like to so the yeast it's kind of like where the food and water can get into the yeast so the yeast can move,like um an that's like to so the git's cin i like where the food and water can get into the ease of these can move
1151,that you have to have a producer in a food web in a food in a food web for it to work out,that um you have to have a producer and a food blead and a food in a food web for it to work out

1162,well when i look at the heart it looks like it's connected to like a bunch of veins which helps your body move and let the blood flow around,well when i look at the heart it looks like it's conected to like a bunch of vaines and which helps your body move and let the blud flow round
1163,well there's lots of like forests and water where animals can live,well there's lots of like forest and water where lots of animals can live
1164,i noticed that it's also a system because there's lots of parts that work together and help each other to make the body move and stay alive,i notice that it's also a siston because there's lots of parts that work togeother and help each other to make the botny move and stay alive
1165,well there's like the wheels that work together and then there's different gears and lots of different parts that help the car move,well there's like the wheels that workd together and then there's different gears and lots of different parts that help the car moveve

1182,they also help you digest your food,they also heolp you divejust your food
1183,they need pollen,i need pol
1184,there's there's skin cells brain cells and,sthr skin kept their skinsells brnsells
1185,that the leaf the leaf cell it has lot it has more it has more cells than the humans,thad um the leaf the leafsall it has lot it has more it has um more sells than human s
1186,i notice that there's lots of cells in the thigh,i noticed no theres am lots of selles in the pie
1187,that those aren't plants,that those are plants
1188,because we have lots of cells in our body,because we have lots of seles in our body
1189,it helps you swallow down the food and,it helps you swollow down the food andy
1190,that's where all your food goes,that's where all your food goes
1191,that they have,that they have um lot
1192,there's lots of cells and like yeah,there is lots of selvs and um like yeah
1193,it will take out all the bad stuff and it will break things down,it will take out all about stuff and it wi'll break things do
1194,good,te
1195,it brings your food down,it brings your food down
1196,that they look like cells,that um they look like sel
1197,this kind of actually looks like a human body,this kind of actually looks like a human body
1198,that's yeast,that's east
1199,lots of meat and blood and muscle but especially skin especially cells,bots of net and bloud and muscles but especially kis u especially selles
1200,there's like lungs and there's a heart there's lots,there's like longs and there's a heart there's los
1201,it breaks it down so we don't choke,it breaks it down so we don't choke
1202,that that's where your food goes down to your stomach,that that's where your food goes down to your stumic
1203,that they help you like think and if you didn't have brain cells it'd be hard to remember things and smell things and hear things,that they help you like thing and um m she didn't have burnselves and be hard to remember things and smell things and hear things
1204,that almost anything has cells,thet almost anything has seles
1205,well it's showing like living systems,well it's shelling like um living sistums
1206,about how like our food digests and where our food goes and yeah,about um how like our food die jes and um where our food gos andy
1207,the different parts of the body,the different parts of the body

1215,well there's this like chemical in the stomach which is blocked by it and if that ever gets into the food then you'll throw up,well there's this like cemical in the stumic which is sbalked by it and if that ever gets indo the food then youll throw up
1216,well this is an insect but it can it's also an animal and it should it also has cells,well this is an insect but it can it's alsan animal nature it also ourselve
1217,i notice that they look a lot like so they like if they hi if the human had like the human has cells the yeast looks like cells,n i notice that they look a lot like so they like iftehigh if the human had like the human has sells the yuc looks like selves
1218,they're like moving somewhere else because it's going to get cold on where they are or where they are,they're like moving somewhere else because it's gong to get cold on where they are owhere they r
1219,instinctual behavior,instint tu behavier
1220,about like like lungs and how we breathe,about like um like it lungs and how e breea
1221,well it like could blend into the coral,well it like could blend into the quarrel
1222,it's like a reaction and it's like it's an instinct where you don't have to learn to take your hand away you you kind of just do it because it hurts when you burn your hand,it's like a re action and it's like it's  an instint twer you don't hav to learn to take your hand away yu it you cn't of just do it because it hurts when you burn your han
1223,it could have a really weird reaction,it could have a really weard reraction
1224,because like they're so bright and they have their wings can help it fly away from predators,because like theyre show bright and they hu their wings that can help it fly away from preddlers
1225,it like it blends in to the coral and plants in the sea so it and it looks like it could go pretty fast and get away from predators,it like it blins in to the quarel and plants in the see so it and it looks like it co go pretty fast and get away from budlers
1226,good how are you,good how are you
1227,well it's a really hard shell like hard as a rock so if something it's going to be hard for it to get for the tortoise to get hurt if the tortoise can go inside of its shell,wll it's a really hard shell like card as a rock so if something it's gong to be hard fur it's to get if fr the tortoise to get hurt if the tortoise can go inside of its shell
1228,well the the skunk is like making his smell so that the coyote will go away,well the the stunk is like making his smell so the cyodie will go away from
1229,the his smell is like skunk smell because it's really stinky,the his smell his like stunk smell because it's really stinky
1230,number two does because they're canine teeth and they're really sharp and helps them like chew it up,number tudus because they ar tn ine teeth and theyre really sharp and helps them like chewit up
1231,i think that its wings do so it could fly away,i think that it's um wings do so it calnd fly away
1232,because as like the right kind of web kind of in like it it's really like helps it push,because tas like the right kind of web kind of and like itit's really like it helps at pushn
1233,no it isn't a learned behavior because it's like a reaction,kno it isn't a learned behaviore because it's like a re action
1234,it is like one of its adaptations is that it blends in with the sand so if one of its predators come by it may not be able to see it,it is like one of its ataptations is that it bluns in with the sand so if one of its pelers come by it may not be able to see it
1235,it we we're learning about like how animals like use to attractions to call mates or sense danger,it well were learning about like how animals like use atractions to call mates or sense danger
1236,goodbye i'll miss you,goodbye i'll miss you
1237,well the snake is the stimulus and the girl is the reaction,well the snake is the stimuuss and the girl is the re action
1238,well it looks like they're saying like go away i just got that on speaker oh my gosh,well it looks like the'res sing like go whical i just go that on e speaker h magas
1239,well the skunk would use its smell cause it it stinks like really bad it will use its smell to make predators go away,well the skunk will use its smell bcause it stinks like really bad it will use its mells to make predators go away
1240,that they'll show a stimulus and and a reaction i already told you that,that he'll show a stimuluss and an re action i'r told you that
1241,yes you do have to learn how to write because it's not instinctive it's a learning thing,yes you do have to learn how to rite because yit's not instintive it's a learning thing
1242,it helps it blend into things,it helps at blondidn't a thing
1243,well she's like like the snake is warning the girl with his rattle,well she's like lege the snake is warning the girl with his raddle
1244,that they all call for mates and sense danger and let each other know and they try and get away from predators and yeah,that they all call form mates and sense danger and let each other know and they try to get away from pedlars inye
1245,it's about stimulus it's mostly about actually like reactions and stuff,s about stimuluss and it's mostaly about actually like reactionsaid stuff
1246,the the feet is little tiny little cute little feet,the the feet his little tiny little cut little feet
1247,so the human doesn't get hurt he's just giving her a simple warning,wll so the human doesn't get hurt he's just giving her a simple warn
1248,because that is their food and it also can help us,because that is their food and it also can help us
1249,it means that like you produce things like um trees produce air,it means that like you produce things like um trees prettise air
1250,it is because if there's litter or paper like newspaper on the ground they can break it down and turn it into soil so there's no more litter,it is because if there's litter or paper like newspaper on the ground they can break it down and turn it into soil so there's no more litter
1251,that means that they are decomposers also known as detrivores,that means that they are de composers also non as detvors
1252,this is like what um an herbivore an omnivore and carnivore and a detrivore is,this is like what um a h an erbor an onivor in convor in a detcr vorce
1253,like plants and berries and fruits and um meat and bacon and,like plants and bearryes and fruitsand um meeat an baken and
1254,an um the organism a red worm is is a decomposer also known as a detrivore,um the orgonisom of red warm is is a decomposer also known as a detre
1255,well there's decomposers consumers and um,el there's de composers concumers and um
1256,um these are red worms and red worms also eat decaying matter they will help out the earth and if there's a laying around newspaper which is littering then they can break it down and turn it into soil,um these are red wearms and rebrrms also need to ang matter they will help out the earth and if there's a ling around newspaper which is littering then they can break it down and turn it into soi
1257,consumers decomposers and producers,concumers de composers and producers
1258,i have to get um your energy from other organisms,that you have to get um you're energy from otheur orgonisoms
1259,the bear is an omnivore because it eats both plants and meat,the bear is an obnwor because he eats both plants and waite
1260,good,good
1261,they if there's a laying around newspaper that is practically um littering they can break it down into into soil,they if there's a lang around newspaper that is practicaly um littering they can break it down into into soil
1262,decomposers consumers and producers,de composers concumers and producers
1263,they're um breaking down the newspaper and leaves and turning it into soil,air um breaking down the news paper and leaves and turning it into soil
1264,a decomposer,a decomposer
1265,well they're producing things and since they they make their own food and um so they're producing their own food,well the're producing things and since they they make their own food and um so they are producing their own food
1266,no,no
1267,after um a a couple weeks it will turn into soil,after um lo a cople weeks it will turn into soil
1268,it means like that they eat all like they eat everything they'll eat all foods,it means like that they all like they eat everything they le eat all foods
1269,about living systems,about living sistoms
1270,about like the different types of leaves and like the different names and about the roots in the leaves,about like the different types of leaves and like the different names and about the roots in the leaves
1271,that there's a pinnate a palmate and a parallel,that there's a pinte a poll mate and a parrelew
1272,well there are like parallel roots and there's palmate and pinnate types of roots,well theye are like parello roots and there's pallmate and pinate tyipes of roots
1273,there's three kinds of veins there's palmate pinnate and parallel,there's three kinds of van there's pll mat pynate and parrilll
1274,all the roots are different and they're shape is different,all the roots are different and their shape is different
1275,they help you like pump air out of your system and then back in,they help you like pump air out of your sistom and them back in
1276,i think the lungs,i think the lungs
1277,they all help you like digest your food,they all help you like digjustyur food
1278,um helping pump the air into your lungs and out of,i'm helping pump the air in tour lwings and hou
1279,that like it's um like the lung because it's the thing that's actually helping you pump air and pump it out,that like it's um like the long because it's the thing that's actually helpd yo pump air and pump it o
1280,bronchi,bron c broncles
1281,i think it's all about how how your lungs help pump out air and like how they help you breathe and like they're like helping you pump,i think it's all about how how your lungs ume pump out air and like how they help you breathe and like they're like helping you pump
1282,because if you couldn't breathe you wouldn't be alive and,because if you couldn't breathe you want t be alive and
1283,the lungs nose mouth um bronchi diaphragm,the lons nose mouthe um brai difram
1284,your esophagus and your mouth,you're istoicis and your mouth
1285,about the digestive system and um how your food digests and how you breathe,about the die justins sistom and um how your food die just and how you breathe
1286,this is the anatomy,this is the annominy
1287,that this is like it goes through,thought this is like how it goes through
1288,it looks like it helps you breathe and pumps your lungs and it gets rid of bad air and brings good air,it looks like iat helps you breathe and pumps your lungs and it gets reid of bad air and brings good air
1289,i'm good how are you,i'm good how are you
1290,it gets the breathing for in humans,it gets the breathing for any humans
1291,they it gets rid of all of the bad air,they it gets rid of all of the bad air
1292,actually the wind might also be helping evaporate,actua wenmight also be helping a vaporate
1293,well jungle is for moistness cause it has more rain but desert has even if you did put a little water there it'd evaporate really quickly cause the temperature is so hot,well jungle is full of moisess cause it has more brain by a dosert has even if yo ld did bubbo wateter and a vaprat rely quickly cause the temperature is so high
1294,different,ifferent
1295,when it's warm it loses more because um when it's warm that helps the evaporation,when it is warm it rozes more because um when it's warm that helps e avaprbraton
1296,it would easily come and evaporate the water,it would easily come and vepperat the water
1297,when the air's full of moisture or when it's humid when well when the air is full of moisture it has less chance of evaporating but it's humid it has a way better chance of evaporating,when the airs wre more sure when it's humid when wel tairs fuof moysture as the treams of vepirate et's humin it was a wy better chance of e veporating
1298,um because it's pushing it away from the heat,um because itis pushing it away from the hea
1299,it evaporates and sometimes it makes a little rain cloud,a vaprates and sometimes it makes a little rainclo
1300,it evaporates less than the desert,it ivappirates west than it doesert
1301,well cause well it kinda slows it down cause it pushes the water away instead of bringing it nearer for the um temperature to evaporate,well cause well it cont sels t dncause it pushes the water away instead of bring it nearer for the um he temprture to abapr at
1302,good thank you,good thank you
1303,um we've been learning about evaporation,i'miven warning about a vappor aon
1304,when it's very cool like twenty two or twenty degrees or lower it only loses zero or one milliliter,en it's a very go wrked twenty two or twenty degrees  or woler it only ros s zero or one midllaiter
1305,no i'm trying to say that more water evaporates in a desert than it does in a jungle,tring to saymore water about brates in the desert than a doesent the jungle
1306,well since you you can more see that b c d um that well the higher the temperature the more water loss,well sence your ordeitm you can more seed at the b ct um that well the hird a temperature the more water walls
1307,thank you marnie she's,thank you moniy she's
1308,well that's weird it's um the temperature is plus two for a and b then it's minus five for b and c and then it's minus two for d and c,well that's sweet it's m detemperature is pussed two for aan b then its min ast five furb an ce and en it's min us two frdan ce
1309,well we put em in different places to see if they evaporate faster,wil we poin t rm pices to see if they ar vapprite faster
1310,we put one up high which is in the ceiling we put one by a computer which is near static electricity and we put one in the fridge which could be hot or warm or cold,e put one a pie which is in the steling we put one by a computer which is anestic electrisity and we put one in fridge which coul be hot or warm or cold
1311,bye marnie it was very good to see you again um so um i hope other students get to have as much fun with you as i did bye spaghet spaghetti is what you say for spaghetti he he,by marnie it was very good to seou again um so um i hope u oson to get the houses mis fronif you as o d iy i gaspect gaties what you say for coud geti he
1312,eah yes it is,yeah yes i tis
1313,the droplet is slowly getting out of the dropper and dropping on a penny which is gonna make a bigger dome dome is a scientific term and a normal,te drop what is slow wiing out of the dropper and dropping on a penny which is going to make a bigger down do mate a scientific turm and anormal
1314,surface tension is when um is when water forms together to make a shape like a dome or um some other shape,cervouce atention is when um  is when water forms together to make a shape like a dome   sanligha shape
1315,um it makes uh form a small ball because all the water gathers together,um it makes a form a small ball because water gethers together
1316,the water drops all join together in one big object and um yeah so that's pretty much what it is basic,the water drops all during a giver in one big object and um yah so itdoes petty much what it is i
1317,hydrone and oxygen are mixing and more water is gathering together,hidan gin are mixing and more water is gathering together
1318,um good thank you,um good thank you
1319,well cold water is making it move down but or south but hot water is making it move north or up,bil cold water is make ing ot move down but or south but hot water is making move north or up
1320,thank you,thank you
1321,cold,ol
1322,cork and cork um the cork and uh so it absorbs the water through the glass and it doesn't spill,ork and cowork um the cork and u so it absorbs hi water food to grass and it doesn't spill
1323,um room temperature is the temperature of the room,uhm won temperatures the temperature of the rain
1324,thank you,thank you
1325,it goes north or up cause the water is making it go up the heat actually um yeah so yeah basically,it goes north or up cause the water is making it g up to heat actually um yeh so yeah baccal
1326,the temperature's hot so it's going up up up up up but if you make it go down then the temperature would going down down down and it would be have to be cold,the tempertures hats was going up   p p but if you make yo go down then the tempture would going down down down and it would be have to be cold
1327,i did an experiment in class and i know what happens,a do n experiment at class and i know what happens
1328,i've been doing water uh,i have been doing water
1329,hi,i
1330,um i think it feels um cold,i think yut feels um coard
1331,um temperature is all the hot and cold,ou temperature is all that hot and cold
1332,d do you have anything else,ddo you have anything else
1333,when you make it colder it goes south way down but when you make it hotter it goes up or north,hen you make it colder equal south or down but when you make a hoter it gos up or north
1334,thank you and marnie can you say kitty cats,thank you and money can you sic kitty cat
1335,chill he,true he
1336,more space marnie,more space morning
1337,i no when um you're maybe doing a science experiment or again seeing when the temperature is outside,igh nwhen u you'e maer in a science experiment ore again seen when the temperature is outside
1338,um something just came up oh okay,m seven y canaot lokt te drs
1339,yes i have,yes i have
1340,temperature is um yeah it's hot and cold and when um it is hot it can make the water go up but when it's cold it goes down,ea
1341,yeah and yeah yeah but cause it would be um hurtful if,yeah and  yeh yu but prismers aren't markor ann more caus  be um hurtful if
1342,thank you,thank you
1343,it goes down or um it takes up s a lot of space,it goes down or um take ups west space
1344,we put a thermometer in it and then it tells you temperature if you want to be room temperature you let it stay in the room for a while maybe a day,will you put  fa monnagur in it and then it tells you a temperature if you want to be roomtembertree you woul't stay in the room for a while maybe day
1345,the temperature below it is hot,e tempature below it is hot
1346,it's about if it's i think it's not too hot not too cold and that would be room temperature wh and it's right there in the middle too hot would be too up too cold would be too down yeah,it's about if it's i think it's not o hat inot to cold and that would be a room temppture and it's right deare in tha middle too hot it would be too up to cold would be to downye
1347,um thank you marnie can you say kitty cats,um thank you mmney can you say to cat
1348,no cause i already knew about the thermometer so i just thought the thing would be the same,no ecause i already knew but but the pemonetor so i just k the fing wuld be to saying
1349,you are absolutely positively right,you are absallutly posittive ly right
1350,um it goes down like you just showed me or low low low low yes that was really cool,um it goes down like you just show me o loh  we  ye ther as three gold
1351,me i thought it was really cool,mean i fought was reecle
1352,inside the tube is really water with green food coloring but then it goes up with hot water down with cold yes,decied to r water with green food covring but ten goes up with hat water down with cold yes
1353,yes,yes
1354,um when you wanna know what temperature will be outside so you can know how to dress,um when you want know what times you're will be outside so you can know how to tres
1355,thank you,thankyo
1356,that too,that too
1357,marnie this is jackie can you say something please,monniy this is jacky can you say something plice
1358,well soil absorbs water gravel lets it go through but sometimes um gravel um gets wet by water that's most of the time what happens,well soyou obsorbes water gral let's it go through but sometimes um gravl um gets wet by  lor as most of th time what happens
1359,it has it kept some inside it and it let some out so that would basically double the mass the normal mass,it had it kept some inside it and it wet some out so that would basiquy dubble rthe mas the normal mass
1360,the water to the soil the soil absorbed the water,ws to disswod  soil absorbed the water
1361,it's about um how the soil can absorb but a lot but the um gravel can absorb very little,s about um how ta soier can observe but a wot but the um grabble can obsorb very little
1362,comes from us experimenting in the class,tcomes from us experimenta in the class
1363,i see two triangular things they're kind of like um cones one is soil and one is gravel,i see two try angular fang that can't rihe um cones one soil and one is grabvil
1364,we've been um we've been doing stuff with gravel and soil,we've been doing stuff with gravil and soil
1365,good thank you,good thank you
1366,thank you,hank you
1367,originally i think they came from um well soil came from dirt which god invented and um same thing with gravel except gravel did not come from dirt,iginally i fnk tey came from um te soyo came from the dirt which go and planted and um canping of cabooks i grabl did not come from dirt
1368,well um soil can hold more water cause it absorbs it but gravel can hold less water because it does not absorb it,oh i'm sure you can hold more water because it absorbs itbut grabbl can wes water because it does not absorb it
1369,i watered the gravel the water just went through,d wanted to gravile the water just went through
1370,well sometimes the earth material absorbs sometimes the water can go through,wa smetimes that or mate absorbes sometimes of the water can go thrugh
1371,well um it is shorter than the gravel because the soil absorbs the gravel does not cause the gravel is solid the soil is very very soft,well um it is shorter than the gravl because the soil obsorvbs the grable is that because the grabil is sollid the soil is very very soft
1372,that um the um gravel absorbed actually ten milliliters,da hum the um grael absorbed jackory ten milliaters
1373,to um complete further experiments with better experience,pot it to um compleate farther experiments with better experienc
1374,well most of it went through and um some of it stayed on the rocks to like make the rocks wet wet and yeah the rest went through,well most of it went through and um some of it stayed on the rocks so like make e wax ret wet and he had the wests went through
1375,the amount of water that drained through the gravel was less than the it was more than the soil because the soil absorbs the gravel does not,the amount of water that dran ut a ggrabl was less then the was more than the soyl because the soy absorbs the grabl does not
1376,well the water drainage of the rocks really doesn't make them that heavy because they're already heavy and it did not absorb,the water granige of the rocks ray doesn't make them that heappy because are ready heappy and i do not absorb
1377,you put it on gravel and it goes through it go it doesn't absorb anything,you put on gravil air t gos to o it cause it doesn't absorb anything
1378,the hot water is less dense that is what it tells me,the hot water is west than sthat is what it tells me
1379,um i would say it goes up or north and because the water pushes it up and that shows it's less dense,uhm i would say it goes up or north and because the water pushes it up and that shows its west eanth
1380,they float cause they have less density than the water,they flot cause they have lon denciy in the water
1381,we've been doing water and today we saw things float and sink actually didn't but we put hot water and cold water and hot water went to the top cold water went to the bottom cause they put food coloring in,we've been ding water in today we saw things floatand think ashould be did but we but o want o cold water and hobw our went to sap co wr wint to the bottom as i p ith covared
1382,good bye marnie,goodbye marnye
1383,um it is less dense,um it is best dems
1384,thank you,thank you
1385,um it's about the density of the cold water compared to the density of the room temperature water,um it's about the dencity of the cold water compared to the encity of the rom temperature i water
1386,some of them will float some of them would not that's what what we were trying to do actually we were just doing hot water cold water,some of tem  foalks some of butn would not that's what wel we were trying to do afer were just to ing hot water cold water
1387,um that they are more dense than the water,m that they are more dence in water
1388,um it told me that the cold the cork um was less dense than the water which i did not know,um it told me tat the coat the cork um was less dence than the water which i did not know
1389,the cold water um the cold water is um in there and the cold water is actually more dense so it is floating to the bottom and can going all around too,the cold water um the cold water is umand there in the cold water is actually more dencis foting to the buttom and cangoll around
1390,well they're all about density and which ones are less dense and more dense,wide about dencity and which men o restans and more dene
1391,m that um not all of a lot of the red water floated to the top but not all of it be you have to even a vial kind of floated to the top when it was done,m an that um not all of a watr of the red water worded ta jop but not all it bshe even a vil kind fute to the top when it was tun
1392,um it sinks and it sometimes also goes down and spreads,um it's sinks and it simtims obsticles down and spreads
1393,it means to have the things float instead of means um like they will sink cause they're more dense than the water,it means tohave  in boat instead of wants means um buy they will sink car more dency in the water
1394,uh um hot water was more dense i mean less dense than the cold i mean than the room temperature water,um hot water was more denc i mean est enc tan the cold i mean tn a room temprture water
1395,they are both less dense and they are both both have the same density,they are both less dence and dbho the same dencity
1396,that they um would that they are lighter than that they are lighter than the uh less dense than the water,the day um wou that they are whitter han that they are whiter than the west ten tn water
1397,true,trew
1398,it is about um how cold water is more dense than room temperature water yeah cold water is more dense than room temperature water,it is about um ho cold water is more denthn inroom temperture water yeah cold wateris more denctan room temperture water
1399,um they um they are sinking because they are more dense than the water,um they um they are sinking because they are more denctin the water
1400,the red water is floating out of the vial because it is less dense therefore it floats to the top why can't,the red water is floting out of the vile because it is less dens theire fore it fo to the top i ca
1401,a good thank you,good thank you
1402,they stay on the bottom of the cup because um they um are more dense than the water so yeah it all is um it all somehow connects to density,they sit on ta bottom of the cup because um day um a more denc in the water so yeah it all is um it oll some how condectd to dencity
1403,it's exposed to air which co which is evaporating it,s exposed to air which which is avaading it
1404,the hot air,d har
1405,in the wider cup cause it has more it has a more of a way to evaporate,in the whiter c cause it des more it has a mor e way to evapporate
1406,yes,yes
1407,um how big or round the surface area is,um how big or round a scirface area asked
1408,well uh yeah they all lost half as i thought,well oh theyre they all lost hav as i fought
1409,go good thank you,goo good dnyou
1410,b is one hundred but c but a is sixteen but there still the same amount of water,well um you can roll over them and you conce that d is two hundreds squar said mitas ce is twenty four
1411,um they are all um yeah they all uh they all have the same amount of water just in different cases,um they're all um yeah they' alll um they all have to save amout of water  just in different cases
1412,the water on the surface is touching um the side of the container,the water on the cuirface is touching um the side of the container
1413,each one loses half,each one moses half
1414,this area is the area of the water,aara is the arva of the water
1415,um i've been um doing evaporation and today was the second day of where we put stuff in places like the refrigerator the ceiling the window sill the cortec computer,um i've been um dren avapibration and it saiday was a second day if where we put stff and pices i the revrtuater t seailing toe windo sailed a cort t computer
1416,it's about how wide the thing is it was just half because it's so wide and available to be evaporated,it's about how whide e fang is it was is half because  so whide and avaiable to be evappiratod
1417,two hundred square centimeters,to ern discorse and mtors
1418,well the hotter the room and the wider the surface area the more is evaporating,well te hoer o roum and the whieri curface area the more s the bati did
1419,good thank you,good thank you
1420,t the paper towel got wet and soon the water was gone but you could see that it had taken the water into its material,when the paper towl got wet and soon the water was gone but you could see that it had taken awater into its material
1421,um we've been learning about water and um doing lots of fun experiments and and we've played with normal and soapy and even salt water,um we've been worning about water and um doing lots of fun experiments  and we've ed with normal and soapy and even saltwater
1422,just a spot of water but if um but as it i put more drops and it looked started to look like a dome,just  spit of water but it's um but as it i put more drops when it wok started to look like a dome
1423,yes it was really interesting to do that and learn all about the and you learned some about water that i didn't even know,yes it was really interesting todutath and wern't all about the inwords them about water did i din't even know
1424,you have to tilt the paper and sometimes it doesn't work eventually if you tilt it enough it does,you have to tilt the paper and sometimes it doesn't work butventur fut t enough it does
1425,thank you you are very kind,thank you you' here very kind
1426,because the all the um drops of water i think they go together and just they make that shape and cause it's a certain material it doesn't just fall flat,because te au um drops of water i think they go together and just to make that shape and cause it's ert a material orit doesn't just fall fat
1427,water tension is the thing that makes it shape like anything it wants to be like,wat attention is the fhing that makes it shape like anything it wants to be like
1428,it i meant by like what as when you put in more drops on the um soapy water it can hold less than a penny can hold with normal water,it i membywrk it w as when you put more drops on te um soapy water it can hold west than a penny can hold wth normal water
1429,it looks like a tear drop,it locs like a tear drop
1430,so the puddle was so cool it was just like a dome which i believe is the scientific term for something,so the puddle was so cool h it was just like a done which i beweve it's a cientific turm for something
1431,bye she's,by he's
1432,good thank you,good thank you
1433,it goes up into the air,it goes up into the air
1434,um oh wait sorry i,please repeat a wait sory a
1435,m cold cold water,in cold coldwater
1436,well um in one it's cold water which causes surface tension to break and uh water vapor to be seen then eventually goes up to air and turns into what it was,well um an when it's colled water which caued is cerviuse tention to break in  water baper to be seen then o then she goes up the arand turns into what it was
1437,well we've been doing condensation and evapora and then mostly condensation but a little bit of evaporation,welle we've been doing condemation and evebor a and then mostcondesation but a little bit of evapiration
1438,um well some thing's that evaporate are water and water hot water cold water any kind of water,um ws somethings out of vapbarate ur water and water hot water coled water anykind of water
1439,all about the wind carrying the water in the air to different places,all about the winds carrying the water in the air into different places
1440,like a big lake or yeah big lake and wet,bik a big like or yu hava big like and wet
1441,k people make condensation chambers to see if condensation happens in the chamber,people make condencation chambers to se ve convercation happens in the chamber
1442,um water evaporates and hot water and cold water evaporates too well that's still water but yeah,um water veaporate and  water and cold water ivarates to os owater but yeh
1443,t true,true
1444,air,air
1445,true,tre
1446,water droplets form at whatever part has space they get separated into little little little ones make really big a really big one,bollor drop wat's form at whatever part has space thens tiperinwido w widdle ones  make wely bit a very big one
1447,good,good
1448,um it's kind of like the vapor version of water,m it's like de vape pversion of water
1449,eleven twenty four see one one two four connection lost press okay and wait for marnie okay,bt i fit all about how a water vapr sneake in and now you can see what vapr would a bubbles of airwhat work like air anyway
1450,true,trew
1451,well condensation,bo condensation
1452,um it's like little circles but when it goes on the hot surface you can actually see it and when you touch it it becomes little droplets like little rain drops tears that kind of thing,um it's like widdow circles but when it gos on hosivuce you can notr see it and when you touch it it becomes widdow drop what'like widdw rain drops tears like ind of fang
1453,um it was about seeing if condensation happened in the chamber,um it was about cene of convercatio and happened in the chamber read
1454,hello my um,hew my
1455,yeah well it's not that loud,yeh t well was not that loud
1456,mmm they attract to any piece with well it depends with any piece with iron if they have iron in it because there's a minus and a plus side,ther trick to any piece wer well do pens with any peece with ion if they have ironet because there's ar minors and a pluss side
1457,yeah and it's a lot of com it's pretty complicated,yah and lo it's pretty complicated
1458,the it it doesn't work doesn't it it just doesn't do anything it just stays where it is,the it it doesn't work tdoesn't it it just doesn't do anything justtays whre it is
1459,the switch i just have to hit it,the switch i just have to hi
1460,cause we don't have strong enough batteries we just use d cell batteries,cause we don't have strong enough batries we just use te sell bad rees
1461,just that the power was stronger and,just that the powr was stronger and
1462,they just push it forward but there's like this magnetic field in it that's blocking it and just pushing it out but then when you clamp it just and then you let go it just flies out,th just push it forard ther's like this macgnet feld in i't that's blocking it ad just pushing it out but then w n in clamp in just and then you let go just flies out
1463,a the repelling,the repelling
1464,y y if one of it has iron in it yes,if one of it has irn in it yes
1465,then the electricity is broken a circuit,there in the lectricity is broken  circret
1466,mmm yeah,yeah
1467,um the battery was just giving the electricity and power for it to flow through and then yeah do it make a circuit and then make also a magnet at the same time,um the battery was just giving the lectrisiting power for it to flow through and then eah do it make a circete and then at make also a magnet at the same time
1468,um if you turned it well the switch can actually telegraph the thing you have to take the um switch and hit it against the metal part,um if you turned it well the swish to actually telligraff t thing yehat to take it um swish and hitted against the meddal part
1469,magnetic f magnetic force uh i it um if the nother magnet then you can attach like not just be attracted and,magnet magnetic force it um if there's another magnet then you can attatch mike notse be attracted and
1470,uh just like one centimeter away from you,u just like once sent a me tor away from myou
1471,it would like from far away like if you put the metal bar far away then it will con still do it and then you can show how how strong it is,it like from far away  like if you put the meddal bar far away then itl can still do it and then youcan show hhow strong it is
1472,it's a pathway for electricity,it's a pathway ffor alectriscity
1473,a,
1474,so so when you kept hitting the thing with the bar that on the switch then the there's this bar here that was hitting on the rivet,so so when you kept ditting the thing with the bar that on the swish then the there was the sbar here that was hitting on the river
1475,yeah,ear
1476,then it hits it but then it sticks so that's why you have to hit it back and forth really quick,them it hits it bute then it' sticks so that's why i heav to hit it back in forth rall quick
1477,paper well paper clips do work but paper clips and paper clips don't stick together,paper well paper clips do work but paper clipsin paper clips don't stick together
1478,they're inside the wires the electricity is flowing,there incird the wires electrisity is fulling
1479,me maybe possibly yeah,e maybe poily
1480,no,n
1481,th they would just being used,they were just beng used
1482,it makes the bar hit against the rivet,it makes the bar hit against the river
1483,yeah,eah
1484,yeah it's a magnet but the magnet was used to also make um the talking clicks,yeah it's a magnet but the magnet was used to alo make um thei're talking clicks
1485,north and north won't attract south and south won't attract i think,norte north won't attract satn southm trap i think
1486,the electricity did something to it,the electrisity did something t
1487,yeah yeah,yahy
1488,well with other experience we did it,well with other experienced we didn't
1489,yeah the electricity was f fing jumping,ea the lectriscity was ething jumping
1490,um south and north would attract,um south e north would attract
1491,yep,pick
1492,do,to
1493,yep,ye
1494,you couldn't it just screw it just just ricochets off it it doesn't stay,you couln't nd just gojust just licker shaes off it doesn't stay
1495,in five wires,in five wires
1496,yeah,a
1497,yeah but it also worked as a telegraph thing,eah but it also worked as the tegraf thing
1498,uh nope,i no
1499,yeah so it just cutting the circuit,yeah so i'e just cutting the circt
1500,the negative and the a uwe well we should just say north and south,the neggtive an the and what we should just say north and south
1501,yeah,year
1502,i just felt it as i don't know just more electricity and,i just felt it as oh no just morelectrisity and
1503,the bar that hits the rivet,the bar that hits the river
1504,nope,no
1505,s because that's what works the best,s because that's what works the best
1506,yeah,yeah
1507,o th well the dredge bar or the bar that hits the rivet,w the bridge bar orf the bar that hits the river
1508,metal,medal
1509,um you can s s flip the rib rivet around and then see if it works,um you can sslip the rib rib irt around and then see if it works
1510,maybe i don't really know,maybe i don't really know
1511,uh we had a group and the we talked within each other,uh we had a group and then we talked with in each other
1512,no we all used the same thing,now we all use the same thing
1513,you can do a manual one which you just take th the button and then just flick it and just ca e ca do the clicking thing,you can do a manul on which you just take their barn hen just lick it and des ac do he clicking thing
1514,it would be a lot more powerful,it wil be a lot more powrful
1515,the electromag yeah,the chma yeah
1516,the bar iron some sort of metal that magnets like and that stuff that attract like,the bar i on some sort of mettal that magnet's like an that' stuffed at a track like
1517,the but what the problem is is that we only had just three wires so we can't use three wires to a to attach two batteries to the switch,but whent the problem is is that we only had just three wire so we can't use three wies to t attatch two batries to the switch
1518,the plus side is the positive and the minus side is the negative side,the plut is the positive render minosite is the neggutive tin
1519,mmm yes because if the positive side does not touch the bottom and the negative side doesn't touch the side it it won't turn on,yes because if the positive side does not twitch the bottom and the neggotive side doesn't tutch the side i it won't turn on
1520,okay,ok
1521,after that the the light bulb lights up,after that the the la bob lights up
1522,the electricity moves through the wire and into the light bulb,the lectriscity moves through the wire and into the lept bum
1523,yes,yes
1524,yes they're important,yes there important
1525,i think it's about the just both sides have to touch the light bulb some,i see it's about the just both sides have to toutch the light bob someway
1526,you can use two wires and connect each wire to one of the sides to the negative and positive and connect both wires to the light bulb,you can use two wires and connect each wire to one in the sad to the negotive positive and conect both wires to the lat bum
1527,the wires and the battery didn't light the light bulb because because they weren't in the right places,the wires and the batter didn't lkt the light bob because because they were in the right places
1528,yes it didn't light the light bulb,yes it didn't ligkht the ligh bo
1529,they're important because without the negative or positive side the light bulb can't light light up,ther important because without the neggtive were positvcide the light bob cant light light up
1530,the two line is the d cell and the swirly things are the light bulbs,the two line is the t sellan the si things ar the nappals
1531,no,no
1532,good,good
1533,here is showing where where each of the where the electricity is flowing through,here s showing where where each of the where the lectriit is flying through
1534,the green light might connect to it by um each by it shows which circuit is which,the cia my conect by ich by shows which  circis which
1535,by touching i mean the wires are always connecting to each other,i toing i mean that their buiyters are always connecting to each other
1536,i see two pathways,i see two pathways
1537,the other picture the pathways there was two pathways and in this one there is two other pathways,the other picture ther pathways there was two pathways and in this when there s two other petys
1538,mmm some type of circuits circuits only have one way for the electricity to flow through and some of the ones have two ways or more,some tipe of circ circets only have one way for the little ry to flo through and some other ones have two ways or more
1539,in the other picture the energy of the battery was going to two different to two different light bulbs,in do te picture the der the better was going to two different to two differentnat bulms
1540,yes we did,yes me di
1541,and the flow always um always goes right back to the battery,at the flo always m alwayse goes right back to the batter
1542,no,no
1543,the parallel circuits um ha have always have more than two ways for for the el,he prlo circet um ha always a more than two wa for for the
1544,in parallel circuits the pathways there is always two or more,nd pole coick et the pathways there's a wa two ond more
1545,the direction of the flow always goes to one light bulb and then to another,the direction of the float always goes to one like bob and then to another
1546,mmm i don't know,i don't know
1547,we have been learning about different kind types of circuit,we have been learning about different  types of jirking
1548,a circuit is um a open circuit is if it has a hole,a circay is  a open curcat is if it has a h
1549,good i guess,good i guess
1550,if it's an open circuit then it won't the battery won't give energy to the to the motor,if it's an open tirkey and it won't the batter won't give enargy to the to the moter
1551,the receiver's what takes the energy and the wire's are what takes the energy to it and the battery is what gives the wires the energy to take to the receiver,te receeveris wh takes the anergy and the wiest heart what takes the energy to it and the petter is what gives the wires the enargy to take to the receevear
1552,circuit are like are like i think paper clips and and other kinds of metal,te pun of a circut la w i think paper clops and and  kind of medtal
1553,i discovered that only metal any kind of metal could could could make the motor work,i discovered that only metal anykind of medtl cud cu could make the mater work
1554,the the metal can pick up the washers,the the middal can pick up the washes
1555,cause mmm washers er i don't really know,cus mars i don't realy know
1556,the closed switch where well it'll make the electromagnet work,the close witch were w it will make t look for myn work
1557,i have been learning about,i have been learning about
1558,good,good
1559,mmm about electricity,about alectriscity
1560,spacers,aspicer
1561,the magnets attract,oritripor eo
1562,touched under,how strong
1563,yes,r
1564,the washer is to see how stronger the force of the magnet is,the washic obartse hdree theo  i
1565,the number of washers stronger the magnets the magnets are,watch s oi to i
1566,yes,s
1567,i've been learning about magnets and their force,hav en thero
1568,yes,
1569,the magnets can,ef the s can y ttheargr
1570,better than the right,better than the right
1571,the one on the right has two the one on the left has five so the one on the left has way more than the right,the rone on the right has two the one on the left has five so on the one on the left has an wimore than the right
1572,a solution,a luin
1573,you weighed it and the one with the with the most is concentrated i think,you weaid it and the one with the with a mole is conated i think
1574,a solution,a sallutin

1656,they have to do with um,they have to do with um
1657,i don't know,i don't know
1658,i noticed that they are trying to saturate the water with epsom salt and with,i notice that they are trying to satturate the water with epemsalk and with s
1659,by looking at the solubility,by looking at the sallubillity
1660,think it i think it is because the citric acid is more dense than the sugar,think iti think it is because the centrict ascid is more denc than the suger as
1661,that they're all different,but the rolled the fr
1662,i noticed that it takes less citric acid to saturate fifty milliliters of water than it does to saturate the water with sugar,i noticed that it takes less distric assid to stattuate fifty millleaders of waters than it does to tatcur ssave what the water with shuger
1663,citric,centric as
1664,they saturated the water,they caturated the water
1665,i think that the one on the right will weigh more,i think that the one on the right will waigh more

1667,it means bye,meansby
1668,we could weigh them,we could waitthe
1669,the solutions has different masses because one of them has twice as much solute as the,the sallutions has different mates because one of them has twice as much sallute as the o
1670,okay,ok
1671,the rock is a lot heavier than the feather,the rock is a lot heavier than the feath

1877,the solutions have to weigh the same,the seillitions have to waigh the sa
1878,i figured it out by taking the sixty seven grams and subtracting fifty grams from and getting seventeen grams,i figured it out by taking the sixty seven grams in subtracting fifty grams from theand getting seventeen g
1879,fifty milliliters of salt solution is more concentrated than the fifty milliliters of water therefore it weighed,the fifty mill leters of salt selution is moncantrated then the fifty meeters of water there fore it wave
1880,saturated means that we can't dissolve any more of the epsom salt into the h two o,sacrted means that we can't desolve any more of the epsimsalts into the each to o
1881,i noticed that when it's when the solution is saturated the water level has come above where it originally was,i notice that when its when the sallution is satturated the water levle has come above where it orrigionally wa
1882,the these have to do with um what we did about saturating the water,the these have to do with um what we did about satturating the water
1883,this means that the salt in the solution weighs seventeen grams,this means that the salt in the sellution weaes seventeen grms
1884,those have to do with what we did with saturating the water,those have to do with what we did with satgurating the water
1885,i think that it is gypsum,i think that it is gipson
1886,we can cross out all of them except for quartz,son we can cross out all with them except for a qorts
1887,like feldspar opal mica hornblende malachite magnetite,lik fel  spar ob like a mallicite homelint thmagnetite st
1888,because they don't fit the description,because they do fit the description
1889,it tells us that this mineral can be graphite or gypsum,it tells us that this miniral can't be gratfighe or gipsom
1890,malachite mica opal calcite fluorite galena and gold,mallicite might g abul caowgite for rite galana sin gold
1891,lava cooling into a rock,of a coolling into a rock
1892,you know stuff,you know sto
1893,i notice lava,i noticed labo
1894,you would need the luster the break the streak the hardness,you would need the luster tho break the streak the hardness
1895,absolutely nothing,absolutly nothing
1896,because they cleave instead of fracture,because they cleaze instead of fracture
1897,that it did not scratch,that it did not scratch
1898,no no,non
1899,i don't really care i'm just like watching a cool thing it's the igneous rocks you know it's sick,care i'm just like watching the cool thing it's the ignous rocks you know it's dick
1900,quartz,cords
1901,the streak,the stre
1902,yeah,ting ye
1903,it fractured,it fractured
1904,cause because they both scratch,cause because they both scratch
1905,no,n
1906,you know,oc
1907,definitely not,definitely in
1908,metamorphic rocks i'm just playing with the igneous rocks so shut up,yu'r met a rorfi rocks i'm just playing with he young nes rs shut
1909,that is a streak test,that is a strak tes
1910,because the rock we had fractured but those one didn't,because the rock we had fractured but those ones did
1911,the scratch test,the scratchd tett
1912,they narrowed our options down to quartz,they have nard or otions down to qoarts
1913,absolute,amcu
1914,it did not rule out any options,it did not rule out any opcio
1915,you know just the just the basic,knol yust that is the p
1916,yup,yu
1917,we have quartz,we have cords
1918,this mineral exhibited a cleave,this menil exibited a cleave
1919,yeah yeah i guess,yahye guess
1920,i don't know,unno
1921,they look a lot more different,they look a lot more differenter
1922,minerals are more like minerals than anti mineral maybe,minrls are more like minirls than antime miniral mabarbromicumaybe
1923,brightness,brightness
1924,like brightness,like brightness
1925,they're diamonds,their diamond
1926,the hardness,the hardn
1927,the brightness well this connects to what we've been talking about cause we made flashlights,the brightness well this conects to what we've been talking about cause we made flash lights
1928,on one too,kyes on one two
1929,i don't know right now i'm busy watching,i don't know rnow i'm busy watching fo
1930,i don't know,on yong
1931,rock,rock
1932,the diamond draw a line on it,the diamonds draw a line on
1933,it came from the mineral,it came from the miniral
1934,somebody cracked a a rock with a pick axe,somebody cracked apete a rock with a pickax
1935,from the,on a min
1936,this is this is doing with what we did that we made flashlights,deat is itrding it what we do we made light flash ie
1937,i don't know,ant on the not
1938,they're that i noticed that that guy has two right hands it's creepy trust me,um there that i noticed that the guyes to righte hands it's creapy trst me
1939,tile got a z on it,ammic tile got as z on it
1940,it's a mohs hardness scale,it's a ma hardnessg
1941,i don't,i don't n
1942,it's marking,it's marking
1943,pay attention right now i'm playing with frogs,it hunt o right now i'm i a'm planed with frogs
1944,no,pn
1945,i don't know i wasn't really paying attention i was just playing with your computer program,fu knoin i don't know i wasn't really peng atteention i was dust playing with youre gombuder brogram
1946,s r l soil rocks and land forms,um i saw a el soile rocks on land for
1947,you know like the brightness and where the shadows are in that mineral,and il liked the brightness and where the shadows ar in that minirl
1948,it has to do with what we did earlier today about those like stuff that like rocks and,it has to do with what we did allyar today about thes like stuffed that like brocks in
1949,it's marking,it's mark a
1950,the tiles got z,the tiles got z
1951,a diamond,a diamon
1952,what's a cleavage,what's a pla bide
1953,i just drew on your face with a sharpy i'm sorry marney,i just drum on your face with a sharp beating sorry m
1954,the diamond is a lot shiny more shiny than the like gypsum whatever it's,the diamond is a lot shiny more shinier than thea gipcana
1955,i'm not really paying attention i'm just having fun playing with your,umt  t really man yu centine that iar just having fun playing with you
1956,nothing and then i think diamond's right again,nothing and then i think diamonds right again
1957,volcanic rock,volcana g
1958,this is very this is a fun computer program you know marney it's like hilarious,this is very this is a fun computer programe yuno marni it's like a halarias chg
1959,uh,s
1960,there is humus gravel clay and silt,there's humos gravil clayin sult
1961,i,i don
1962,we've been learning about soil land,we've been learning about soil rumland f
1963,i don't know,i don't kno
1964,um,o
1965,clay,clay
1966,um uh,o
1967,they're in different,t i yong
1968,they're getting mixed together,they weregetting mixd together
1969,they're from different places,they are from different places
1970,the delta has more um clay has more gravel mountains have more,the dalta has more clay aer ahappins ea
1971,they all look different,they all looked different
1972,humus gravel clay and silt,humis graviel clay ind sult
1973,good,goo
1974,cause one of them has more solute than the other one,ione of them has more sollu than the other one
1975,okay,ok
1976,solution b is more concentrated,yo sellution b is more concentrated
1977,no,
1978,the penny is more concentrated than the cork,the penny is more conctrated than the cort
1979,the less concentrated one will go on the top and the more concentrated one will go on the bottom,the less concentrated one will go on the top and the more concentrated one will go on the bottom
1980,more concentrated solutions are more dense than less concentrated solutions,more concentrated selutions are more den than less concentrated selutions
1981,concentrated solutions float on the top,concentrated cillytions float on the top
1982,they sink,a sink
1983,good,good
1984,just means that solution b is more concentrated than than solution,tis means that suluin be is more concntrated tha than solu
1985,we added the lighter one first and then the more the denser one tried to sink to the bottom so they got mixed,we added the lighter one first and then themre the dencer one tried to sink to the bottom so they got mixed
1986,if it is more concentrated it is denser,if it is more concentrated it is dencer
1987,if it's less dense it will float more,if it's less denc it will float more
1988,it are mixed together because solution b is trying to sink to the bottom,it are mixed together because selucin be is trying to sink to the bottom
1989,that's so cool,that's so co
1990,the penny weighs more,the penny waves more
1991,the lighter if we add the lighter salt solution last then it will then it will just stay on top,the lighter if we ad the lighter saultsilution last then it wil then it will just stay on t
1992,i don't know,wha a
1993,uh okay,og
1994,cause it's far away from the sun,could es far away from the sun
1995,spongebob,bunpl
1996,well i guess,i guess
1997,um how hot or cold something is,um how hard a cold something is
1998,right there,right there
1999,yeah um pluto pluto three hundred eighty below,ya pluto pluto three hundred eighty below
2000,a minute,a minute
2001,th it's the freezing mark,it's the freezing mark
2002,uh yeah,ya
2003,actually the liquid in the thermometer is uh alcohol,actor the liquid in the fhromomeateor is a aulca hall
2004,we used paper clips sh miss shelby tricked us and some were small and some were big,we used paper clifs s  sell be tricked us in sumer small summer bink
2005,yeah,jac
2006,yeah,yah
2007,well obviously in the assignment those two were the same actually,l obviously in the assignement those two were ascay nactually
2008,no i wasn't there but i did heard about it,no i wasn't there but i did heard about it
2009,you just let it in,you just let it in

2014,yeah,yeah
2015,i just don't get why america have to use different it's harder,i just i't get why america have to use different it's harder
2016,miss shelby told us then we got thermometers and we actually did yeah,msellby told us then we got famominers and we as we did yeah
2017,on our planet thing i studied pluto so,on ur plant fing i studied pluo so
2018,that's negative and that's below it,dad's neggotive and that's below it
2019,cold,cold
2020,testing testing testing,testing testing testing h
2021,and it's really cold,and it's we cold
2022,that it's not a standard unit it's the standard that's volume and capacity uh celsius,that it's not a standerd using it's the standerd that's folum iccopassiu selies

2024,no everybody got c a and b then miss shelby told us that the eh the c and a is actually the same and b is the coldest,no everybody gut see a me then sell be told us that the the cean ay is actually the same and t is the coldest
2025,well at how long it is so that you can get it through there and around,well a how long it is so that you can get it through there and around
2026,uh how to estimate length,uhow te estimate lingt
2027,no,c know
2028,what,wat
2029,yeah but mostly too little i mean too big yeah,you ah but mostly too little i mean too big yeah
2030,that you could imagine how many of doorknobs up from the door how many s stuff like that how many is there,that you can imagine how many of dornaobs up from the door how many is stuff like that how many is there
2031,uh to estimate how much schools there are in the united states or like houses or buildings,uh deathmat how much schools there are in the unites states re like houses or buildings
2032,uh since we're doing the metric system we're doing meters and stuff like that i usually got everything wrong,isince were doing the metric sistom were doing meaters and stuff like that i usually got everything wrong
2033,well how much there already is and how much land we have how big they are they're pretty big,well how much there alreay is and how much land we have how big they are r pretty bing
2034,mostly using our hands i think,mostly using her hands i think
2035,too big too little,to big to little
2036,yeah,yah
2037,yeah,yeah

2039,yeah yeah,yeah ye
2040,six things,six fings
2041,uh what,h what
2042,yeah,yeah
2043,no cause estimating was not really a right or wrong,now cause estimann is not really a righter wrong
2044,well you kinda look at it and i kinda visual how much it is in real life and try to guess it,well you kind of look at it and i kind of visual how much it isnt real life and try to guess it
2045,estimating first then uh measuring them,astimating first then u measuring them
2046,no,no
2047,uh i think if i visualized it better and maybe tried it a few times then,ui think if i visualized thet better and maybe tried it a few times then
2048,yeah,yeah
2049,yeah,yeah
2050,yeah,yeah
2051,yeah yeah,yeah yeah
2052,well what'd you say i didn't hear you,h whatdo you say i did hear
2053,yes,yes
2054,well you guess the guess um estimate it's like where you guess how much of it is there so that's guess estimating,well you guess the guess um estimate is like where you guess how much of it is there so that's guess ess the mat
2055,yes,yes
2056,like desks and like the white board and like our de um the easel lamps stuff like that,like dess and like the white bird and like our deat um the ea sol lamp stuffli tat

2444,you get more magnet er more washers or something like that,do you get more magnet or i mean waters or something like that
2445,it's a graph okay okay that means all the wire wraps are there to power,it's a grah ok ok ytha means a old yo wire raps are yeare power
2446,it's a wire wrap,e water
2447,they're shutting down,trs shutting down
2448,they're separate pa,thei'r sepret
2449,they share a pathway,they sre a pathway
2450,a is dull and b is more brighter,atall ind bee is more brighter
2451,the circuit isn't lit up yet only one is,the circute isn't lit up yet only one is
2452,it will be more brighter,so
2453,wait b circuit is way different than a circuit,be circuis way different in a circ
2454,the energy is flowing through a certain pathway,the energy is flowing through a certaen pathway
2455,it still lights up but the other one gets brighter,it still light so but the other monk ets briter
2456,energy,energy
2457,long string of light is like,long string of light  is lik
2458,you must not interrupt me today,you must not interrupt me today
2459,it just shuts off,it st chuts off
2460,from bulbs out,flim buls out
2461,one's burned out and one's still perfectly good it it's just shut off plus the energy isn't flowing through,ones burnk out in one still perfectly good exi's just shut off plusti anergys thant flong through
2462,it's energy well if click on,it's energy well if you click go
2463,if one gets off the other one gets brighter,it fun't guts off the other one gets priter
2464,it,i
2465,parallel circuit,at well circat
2466,the energy flows just one way,energy flows just one way
2467,ring,n
2468,if a white bulb ge runs out that means the other one's getting brighter,if the lige ball gruns out that means the other ones getting briter
2469,if one bulb burns out it the filament is broken,t flim b birds out it the fillmet is broken
2470,the other one still lights up but gets way brighter,the other one still lights up but gets way brighter
2471,if,yi
2472,um the other,mthea
2473,the filament powers the bulb so if it burns out the filament will break,devll t powers the ball  so if it burns out to fill ment or break
2474,um it still burns out,it still burns out
2475,the other light bulb gets brighter,the other light bob gets spriter
2476,two,ch
2477,i've been studying more about magnets,i've been studdying more about magnets
2478,i'm going to need help talking,it was bacically just like
2479,good,good h
2480,is very good uh could you be a little more pacific,is very goucan you be littlemore peciciffic
2481,bye bye bye ba ba bye bye bye,by bybott  by by thy by
2482,and well i need help hi,because it's bascically just doing something different like if i click on this it i'll do something like if i get on the mant
2483,if you have a magnet right here on this piece on the big piece of paper and a magnet right here on the thin piece of paper and a pencil right here it won't be strong enough to pull towards this with a pencil behind it,if you have a magnet right here on this piece on the big piece of paper nd a magnet right here on the then piece of paper and a pencil right here it won't be strong enough to pull towards this with the pencil behind it
2484,the force okay,the force oka
2485,well the nail has a magneta field around it so if you put the magnet on it and push it down it's like the magnet will stick to the paper clip always,well the nai has a magnanifeled around it so if you put the magnet on it and push it down it's like the magnet will stick to the paper clip always
2486,it's basically just it's basically the paper clip is always gonna be magnetized rather what you do it's going to be magnetized but if you have something too thick the magnet won't stick to the paper clip,it's baically just it's bacicaly the paper clip is always gong  be magnatized rather what you do it's god on be magneatized but if you have something too thick the magnet will stick to the paperclip
2487,the nail isn't forcing the paper clip up to it because the magnet's off it and also the force is off it so the magnet still has a force and abserbed it like it up,the nail is for seing the paper clip up to it because the magnets off it and also the forees off it so the magnet stll has te forest and absorbed it like swelld it up
2488,well mostly i've been like just trying to discover what else is magnets by rubbing a magnet on something that's not magnetized and it worked,well mostly i feel like just trying to discover what else is magnets bye rubbing a magnet on something that's not magneatized ar it worked
2489,because of the force is forcing it to stick together,because f the forec is forcing it to sstick together
2490,okay so it's the gravity it's called a force and if it doesn't stick that's forcing it away from it,oka so it's the gravity it's called ta force and if it doesn't stick that's forcing it away from it
2491,the nail won't pick up the paper clip because it's not magnetized yet,the nail won't pick up the paper clip because tit's not magnetized yet
2492,the nail isn't picking up the paper clip because the force is always in the magnet,the nail isn't picking up the paper clip because the forces always in the magnet
2493,netism basically is very very important,is only basicay is very very important
2494,cause the nail is getting the magnetic force from the magnet so for instance if you kept doing it it will make the paper clip stick,cause the nail is gaining the magnet at fourct from the magnet so for instance if you kept doing it it will make the paper clip stick
2495,it's called a show flow,call shoflow
2496,everything will drop because most of the rings are getting stuck from the magnet,everything will drop because most of the wrings are getting stuck from the magnet
2497,the rivet is um surrounded by all the wires that are tying it up,the rivve is umsurrounded by all the wirs that are tying it up
2498,okay okay can we just move onto another thing,oka oka can we just move on to another thing
2499,because all the energy flows around and around and around and around the rivet and goes back into the battery and does it again,because all the energy fl mounte arounda around round the river and gos back ito the batterin does it again
2500,cause if the switch is closed that means the circuit works cause it's an electromagnet,cause if the swish is close that means the circu works bcause it's an electral magnet
2501,everything will fly up,everything wials fly up
2502,clo ho hose,clu her hos
2503,so all the energy can come and stick together,i se all the energy can come and stick together
2504,that means it's an open circuit,that means is an open circut
2505,because the energy is it's because it's called an electromagnet dum dum,because the energy is it's because it's called an electral magttumpupb
2506,energy,energy
2507,electromagnet magnets,electro magnt magnets
2508,it's called a rivet,it's called a riv
2509,the washers are getting stuck by the thing duh,the waters are getting sark bthin the
2510,the circuit is uh it's a open circuit now cause the switch is not on,the tircet is int open circuet now bcause the swish is not on
2511,it will just stick to everything,it will just stick to everything
2512,it when it's closed that means all the energy flows through a closed circuit,it when it's close that means all the energy flo througer and may his ha clos seccd
2513,the circuit is closed so that means there's no open spaces,the circet is close so that means thers no open spaces
2514,it will just fir stick ri,it would ost stick wear
2515,good,good
2516,the circuit is switched on,the circut is switched on
2517,all the metal rings will stick,all the medal rings will stick
2518,a show flow,a showflowr
2519,i described it as an open circuit cause the motor isn't spinning,i describe it as an open circu cause the motor isin't spining
2520,i did it uh huh,i did et u
2521,it will stop,it will stop
2522,well magnets connect,magnets connect
2523,they're all metal or steel or copper,there all medtal or steel or copper
2524,cause whenever i tap on something metal it will spin because like it's metal it'll will always spin,cause when iver it tap on something meddal it will spin becaus like it's middal intitwill always spin
2525,it's a circuit,it's a circu
2526,it stops,it stops
2527,insulators and conductors,incilaters and conductors
2528,an open circuit wait a by circuit,an open circu wait a close circu
2529,well they're all metal so that's how it will go cause that's how it will power a motor,using te aina turcat is lik
2530,insulators are not metal but conductors are,insilaters are not medale but conducters are
2531,insulators are metal,incilaters are medal
2532,uh hello,that ll
2533,it's not spinning,it's not spinning
2534,it will not spin,it wll not spin
2535,alright a conductor is metal so it will repow,or a conductor is metal sur power
2536,plus and minus means this side or the negative side,plesent minu means theside or the neggutive side
2537,the two,the tu
2538,it's spinning,it's spining

2548,bye,by
2549,in my own words a circuit is the e,ind my home irculte is t
2550,e it in this setup has no switch,get in this seter it pas no swish
2551,you put the wires on,you put the wire ume
2552,this is what a real circuit looks like,this is what a real circe it looks like

2562,left side isn't lighting up as well but the right side is,left side isn't lighting up as well but the right sigde is
2563,we've been doing in science is lighting two bulbs up with two batteries and two wires,we've been doing in cience is lighting two ballbs up with two badrees in two witeres
2564,good how are you,g are you
2565,they're lighting up green that means the energy's flowing to make the light in the light bul,the lighting up dream that means the energy is flaing to make the lit an apl
2566,the battery flowing through the light bulb,the battery flying to the lipe bolb
2567,it's about four wires two bulbs and one battery,it's about four wires two bollbs and one batter

2574,what i remember about that is trying two batteries and two wires and two bulbs to light up,but il  remember about that is trying two batries and two waiters and two mops lide up
2575,um most of them are la lit up but,most of them are look litta but
2576,i see that the energy's flowing through the light bulb,i see that the ennergye's flowing through the live bulb

2581,i forgot,i forgot
2582,i don't know,i don't know
2583,if it's shorter it will go fast slower,if it's shorter it will go facslower
2584,they're not all the same they're a little different a little different way,they know al this sine theyre a little differen in a little different way
2585,this one's longer that the others and um you only should change one variable at a time,this one's longer than the others and um you only should change one very elater time
2586,since it's smaller it goes faster,sence it's smaller  it goes fast
2587,it's like the other one the shorter the string is then the higher the amount of swings are,it' likes the other one the short of the stringing is thethe high ar the meo wings are
2588,how many times the pendulum swings back and forth,how many times the pencelum swings back in forth
2589,we taped a pencil to our desk and then we let it swing back and forth and see how much how many times it swing it swings back and forth um in twelve seconds,we taked a pencil to our desk and then we'd let it swing back and forth and see how much how many times it's swin it' swing back and forth um and twelve seconds
2590,actually the bigger it gets the more swings it has,actually the the bigger it gets the more ings at hats
2591,um we made a penny with so it went back and forth like a pendulum,um we made u enny with so it went back and forth like a pan
2592,they both have a penny at the end,they both have a penny at the end
2593,a few days ago we flew paper airplanes,a few days ago we lew paper airplanes
2594,if you changed too many variables at once then you might not know if you changed too many and it might not work,if you changed to may veribals at once then you might not know if you changed to many and it might not work
2595,cause if you changed too many things at one time it you don't know if you've changed too many things,cause if you changed to many things at one time it you don't know fyou've changed to many things
2596,the shorter it gets the fa the more swings it does it takes,the shorter it gets a fat the more swings it de it takes
2597,hello,hello
2598,um let's see the bigger the longer ones take longer to go back and forth so it's not as much as it's a shorter one,um let's see the figur the longer ones take longer to go back in forth so it's not as much as it's shorter one
2599,right,right
2600,well we changed it to see if we got it right that time or if it made that worse or make it better,well we change it to see if we got it right that time or if it made that worse or make it better
2601,hello hi,hello high
2602,hello,hello
2603,or you can figure out if that thing made it worse or,ell you can figure out if that thing made itwor sir
2604,hello,hello
2605,we have been we've been putting two passengers at a time and then seeing how far it will go with twenty five winds and then we add two more and then see how far that will go and we keep adding until we get to ten,we have been we've been putting two passengers at a time and then seing how fare it will go with twenty five wines and then we ad two more and then see how far that we'll go and we keep adding til we get to ten
2606,well we figured out the more paper clips it has the s the the slower it goes and it doesn't go as long,well we figure it out the more paper clips it has the the the slower it gos and it doesn't go as long
2607,well we added two every time so two four six eight so we could see how much it the difference would be between how much we put on,well we added two every time soh two four six eight so we could see how much ithe difference would be between how much we put on
2608,yes because uh,yes because at
2609,well if we did more winds it might make it go a little farther but not that far because of the pressure of the paper clips,well if he did more wines it might make it go alittle farther but not thought far because of the presure of the paper clips
2610,it'll make the plane go slower and it won't go as far,it will make the plane go slower and it will go as fa
2611,how far it will go,how far it will go
2612,bye,y
2613,well we we added two paper clips each time that affected how the distance how far it was,well we we added two paper clips each time that effected how the distance how far it was
2614,yes,f
2615,hello,o
2616,well if like you take off one of the of the straws it might affect the plane,ell if lake c you take off lik one of the of the straws and leit effect the plain
2617,it better and you could only change you'd only change one at a time because if you change too many you wouldn't know if that one of em out of that would make it better and the other one just made it worse,it better and you could only change yous only sould change one at a time because if you change to many you wouldn't know  that one of them out of that would make it better and the other one just made it wors
2618,well the,well the
2619,good,good
2620,well it wouldn't be exactly,well it wouldn't be exactly
2621,we've,we
2622,well it depends if you add too many passengers it'll it'll make the,well  it i if you ad to many passengers it ll itl make the
2623,um wow we um it was interesting how much the paper clips affected the plane,um we we um it was interesting him which the paper cliffs effected the plane
2624,good,gad
2625,we added t well you added too many paper clips at a time then you took t too many out of it uh too many off,we added well do you aded to many paper clips at a time then you took tto many tterat to mini off
2626,well the more the less passengers you have the longer the distance will be and the more passengers you have it won't go as far,well more the less passengers you have the longer the distance will be and the more passengers have it won't go as far
2627,we made four paper boats and see how many how much water they can hold and how much pennies it can hold,we made four paper boats and see how many how much lottes they can hold and  how much pennis tit can hold
2628,size is com uh matter what how much water it can hold the size is you know kind a determine what how much water it can hold,pies com  matter what how much water i can hold escizees you know can o deturm in what how much water i can hold
2629,to hold pennies and see how much water it could hold,to hold pennies and see how much whater it could hold
2630,um let's see if you drop the pennies in you can have less you'll probably have less and if you stack em on one side you can have more but if you stack em on the edge it'll tip over and you could have less,um let's  if youd drop the pennisand you can have less you'l probly have less and if you stack him on one side you can have more but if you stack him on the edge ell tip over and you coun have less
2631,well we put,well we put
2632,if you made them all the same you wouldn't know if you made em a smaller or bigger size that they could hold more or less,if you made them all the same you wouldn't know if you made him a smalleror bigger size that they could hold more or less
2633,capacity is uh how much water it can hold and if,asity is that how much water can hold and if
2634,if you put em all over the place then it won't stay up that hard far and it'll just sink but if you put them like in the middle and stack em you can fit more pennies,if you put tem all over the place then it will stay up that heart fa and i'll just think but if you put them like in the middle and stack them you can fit more penies
2635,if you put it on the side it'll sink and if you put it in the middle you can hold more pennies,if you put it on the side i'll sink and if you put it in the middle you can hold more pennies
2636,paper cups,paper cuts
2637,if they're smaller they won't hold as much and if they're bigger they'll hold more,if they're smaller they won't hold as much and if they're bigger they'l hold more
2638,we put the wa,we put the
2639,the smaller ones don't hold as much water and pennies but the taller ones and the bigger ones hold more,the smaller one don't hold as much water ind pennies but the taller ones and the bigger ones hold more
2640,we're gonna s we s see how many capacity it can hold and how many pennies they could hold,yor gan toswe see how much copassitty they can't hold in the how many pennies they could hold
2641,good,ge
2642,better and hold more,better nhold more
2643,you're welcome,you're welcom
2644,if the water's too rough the boat could tip over but if it's calm it'll be easier to put the pennies and it'll stay up,if the waters too ruffh the boat can tip over but if it's calm wi'll be easier tbut the pennies than it ill stay up
2645,then we um we would know how much water it would hold,in the boat and see how much it could hold and um if when it wancs o go en over or it son  then
2646,the s the smaller ones well the smaller one won't hold as much and the biggers one will,the sthe smaller ones will the smaller one won't hold as much in the bigger as one will
2647,how wide and how tall the boat is,how widint ho tall abot is
2648,if you put em all on one side it'll sink but if you put it in the middle they'll stay even and you can hold more pennies,if you put him all on one side i'll sink but if you put it in the middle they'll stay even and you can hold more peniyes
2649,the um the cap,thet um they c
2650,thank you,thank you
2651,f you drop them in it might not hold as much but if you set em in and you keep them even it'll hold more,you drop them an it might not hold as much but if you settamman and you keep them even ill hold more
2652,we made four different sizes to see um which one would,we made four different sizes to see um which one would
2653,if you like put them on one side it would sink over if you balance em it might ha be able to hold more,if you like put them on one side it would sink over if you bowanced theme it might hav be able to hold more
2654,they're about when we're trying to see um w how many pennies can fit into it without it sinking and um,and how much water it can go over ca it can fi before it goes over
2655,if you change too many,if you changed o man
2656,we um we made four boats out of paper cups and we had to make it between one centimeter and four centimeters,we um we made four boats at o paper cups and we had to make it between one sentameetor and fourc enimitors
2657,paper cups,paper cups
2658,if you don't use accurate measurements then it could um let's say you do one that's eight centi,if you don't use acorent measurents then it could um let's say you do one that's eat senm
2659,um there we designed them to hold pennies and to hold a certain amount of water and to see how um much water they could hold,um ther we designe them to hold pennies and to hold a certaonamount water andto see how um much water they cot hold
2660,okay i'm not sure on this one,oky i'm not sure i'm this one
2661,if the water is like ha it's really tall waves it'll knock em over but if it's calm and kind of flat and just sitting there then it'll be easier to stack them,if the water is the hus really tall waves nt will knock tam over but if it's calm and kind of flat and just sitting there then it'll be easier to stack them
2662,if you only change if you change one variable at a time it will be easier to see if you're doing it right or wrong,if you only change if you change one verible  time i'll be easier to see if you're doing it right  wrong
2663,that if you stack em it will stay evenly and that it could hold more and if you just kind of put them all over the place it doesn't really work that well without sinking,that if you stack them ill stay even ly and the it could hold more and if you just kind of put them ul over the place it doesn't really work that wil without thinking
2664,you're only stacking on one side and if you stack em on one side it's gonna sink if you stack em in the middle like the one on the left it'll stay up longer,yu're only stacking on one side and if you ack im on one side it's going to sink if you stuck him in the middle like the one on the left it'll stay up longer
2665,if let's see um we're,if uld se c
2666,i can't i'm not sure,i can't i'm not sure
2667,to see which one would work better if the smaller one or the medium sized one or the bigger one and so we could just choose different kinds and see what the results are for different ones,to see which one would work better if the smaller one or the meedium size one or the bigger one and so we could just chose different kinds and see what the results are for different ones
2668,that the smaller one might hold less amount of pennies and then the medium will hold a little more and a little more and a little more,that the smaller one might hold less samount of pennies and then the meedium hold a little more and a little more and a lttle more
2669,if you only change one thing at a time it might be easier to see if that thing made it worse or better,if you only change one thing at a time it might be easy to sy if that thing made it wors or better
2670,if you set them down it might be easier to put more in if you kind a just drop em in it might you know make it sink,if you set them down it might be easier to put more ind if you kind of just drop amin it might youno make it sink
2671,um let's see if w,an e s i wi
2672,at one time you could,s at one time you coul
2673,if they're smaller then it'll be harder to put more pennies in and if they're bigger it'll be easier since they're taller and you can put more pennies in without it sinking,if the're smaller then it'll be harder to put more pennies in and if theyre bigger i'll be easer since they are taller and you can put more pennies than without it sinking
2674,if you put them in the middle they'll be able to have more since it's balanced and if you put them kinda everywhere it'll sink faster,if you put them in the middle yo'll be able t have more since it's baolancet and if you put them kind o everywhere i'll sink faster
2675,um the smaller ones might not as hold as much pennies because they're not as taller and it'll overflow faster,um the smaller ones might not s hold as much pennies because theyrenot as toller and itl overflow faster
2676,know if they're wrong or right,no if they were wrong right
2677,you should stop there because if you put any more in you'll probably overflow the boat,you should stop there because if you put anymore in you' probly overflow the boat
2678,if you would let's see um,if you say m
2679,with string and then the other one's supposed to be eight too but if you do one that's accidentally nine it'll end up being a little different,song was string and then the other one supose to be eight two but if you do one that's accidentally nine h and u being a little different
2680,um it was important to make sure there's different sizes and if they weren't different sizes they would just carry the same amount of water and pennies,um it was important to mak sure there ws different sizes and if they weren't different sizes they would just carry the same amount of water and pennies
2681,well you should um,well yo should un
2682,like you could have if you added too many things you,like you could ave if you added to many things you'
2683,how much how tall the boat was and how wide it was,how much how tall the boat wasn't how wide it was
2684,once the boat sunk you took one penny out and then counted how many pennies you have left and see that's how many passengers your boat can hold,once about sunk you took one tenny al and then counted how many pennies you have left and see that's how many pascangers your bult can hold
2685,when the boat,when the boat
2686,that the difference if they're wider or taller they'll will hold more water and more pennies,that the difference if they'r whiter or toller thel will hold more water and more pennies
2687,the one that's under water has too many pennies because they're all piled up and they're spread out but the one um that's still above is even and it'll be easier,the one that's under water has to my pennies becuse i're all piled up and they spread out but the one um that's still above is even and i'll be easer
2688,cause if they were the same then you don't even know if you know other kinds would work better or work less,cause if they were the same then you dt wuln know if you know other kinds would work eter or work less
2689,well the smaller one might be um might not as m,well the smaller one might be  might not as
2690,if the boat is smaller it'll be harder to put the pennies in since if it had more pressure and weight on it and it's not as tall and it'll sink with more less pennies,if the boat is smaller i'll be harder to put the pennies in since if i had more pressure and wait on it ints not as tall and itll sink with more less pennies
2691,u,n
2692,this week in science we've been working on the capacity of boats with little paper cups and we've been seeing how much water they can hold and how much pennies they can hold,this week in cience we've been working on licpascity of bots will little paper cups and we've ben seing how much water they can hold and how much pennies they can hold
2693,cause it depends how you put the pennies in if you kind of drop em in they might be less if you set em in it might be easier if you put em on one side it might be harder to do that and if you stack em evenly it might have more,cause it depends how you put the pennies in if you kind o drop them in they might be less if you set a minit mght be easier if you put thim on one side it might be harder to do that and if you stock me even lay it might have more
2694,bye,by
2695,yeah we'll probably try out and launch those tommorow,yowl proably try out and lanc os tomorrow
2696,well the um the straws hold up and the stick holds the rubber band and the propeller and the straws hold up the whole plane,well the um the straws hold up and the te stick holds a rubber band and the perpeller and the straws hold up the hole plane
2697,a i'm not sure since we haven't learned much about this,y i'm not sure since we hhaven't learned much about this
2698,um all we did so far is we did the predictions and the questions and she hasn't described all the parts so we're not really sure,um all oh e did so far as we did the protections in the questions and she hasn't described all the parts so were not rily sure
2699,well that's pretty much what we did so far and we're going to start um making this actually making it tomorrow,well that's pretty much whatwe deds so far i' wereging to start um making the actually making it tomorrow
2700,yep,gp
2701,well we um spinned the propeller like twenty five times and we added two paper clips each time to see how far it went with more paper clips,well we um sbend the perpeller like twenty five times and we added two paper clips each time to see how far it went with more paper clips
2702,can i see a picture of,can i see a picture o
2703,yeah the rubber band,a thee river band
2704,um probably the flipper base and the um stick that holds it up and the rubber stop,um probably theflipper bace and the u um stick that holds it up and the rubber stop
2705,well we could instead of a cork we could like use a ball of tin foil like mister suggested or we could use something heavier and that might affect how far it goes,well we coult insead of a corke we could like yu was a ball of tin foil like mter ing cist saggested or we could yuse something heheavier and that might effect how far it gos
2706,hi,i
2707,we'll probably make either a graph or we'll probably make a chart,wi'l probably make either a graft or bur will probly make a cchart
2708,yep the weight may um affect how far it goes,yet the waight my uhm effects how far it gos
2709,can you show me a picture of the flipper,can you show me a picture of the flipper
2710,that they all have a different purpose the cork is what we're gonna launch and then the rubber stopper helps it um stay up and then,that they all have a different purpose the quorckrs what orgon to logh and then the rubber stopper helps that um stay up and th
2711,well we're gonna put a cork and then we're gonna launch it at different heights and see how far it'll go,well work gon  put a cork and then rgn lanch at at different hights in te see how far i ill go
2712,hold on,um you can use the flipper reace te um set up the um the
2713,yep,deap
2714,we've been making predictions and questions on the flipper and the launcher of the flipper,we've been making predictions and questions on the flipper ind the buncher of the flipper
2715,stick is um holding it up and the flipper base is how we hold it up and launch it,lip stick is um holding it up in the flipper bace is helty hold it up in thechr
2716,um we could see how it could when we spin it how far it could go,um we could see how it c when do we spend it how far it could go
2717,well,well
2718,the straws tried to h to hold up the string and the popsicle sticks we narrowed it down so it would fit in to those little things that hold the rubber band and their propeller and that's how it works,the straws tried to the hold up the string and the popschol siks we nerred it down so i fet in to those little things that hold the rubber bean n their pepeller and that's how it works
2719,well the one on the bottom's not as straight as the one on top up and i think that if the one on the top's straighter it'll be easier for it to fly but at the one at an angle it might be harder for,well the one on the bottom s not as stright as e onetop and i think that if the one on the top straight er itll be easier for it to fly but at the one i the angle it might be hardy for it
2720,we used popsicle sticks and a propeller and straws and then were we were spinning the propeller twenty five times to see it how far it could get down the string,we use pop scal sticks and a pepeller and straws and then were we were spinning the perpeller twenty five times to see it how far could get down the string
2721,effects how much it can fly,efects how much it can fly
2722,is that you you have the propeller and something that holds the propeller up and then you have,is that you you have the prepeller and something that holds the prepeller up andthen ye
2723,well me and my partner we put our string at an angle and we learned that if you put it at an angle it,well mean my partner we put our string the angle and we learnd that if you put it at tha angle it
2724,body of it and then you have something that holds it up and makes it fly,body of it and then you have something that holds it up and makes it fly
2725,peller up so we could se,pellor up so we could s
2726,well flight line hold,well sight ligne hod
2727,bye thank you,i thank you
2728,they they held up the um propeller and it helped to spin it and it kept it from falling down and it helped a lot,theythey held up the um propeller and it helped to spen it and it kept it from falling down and it helped a lot
2729,good,get
2730,and making planes with straws on a propeller and we took the string and tied it to two chairs and wind up the propeller and see how far it could get,hen making plains with draws on a popellor and we took the string and tihted to two chears and wimed up the propellar and see how far it could get
2731,what makes a propeller so,at makes up a plaine s
2732,well you need to think about how far you should spread apart your straws and what kind of string you should use and how many times you uh wind up the propeller,well you need t think ofl how far you sould spead part your stras and what kind of streiam you should use and how many times you a wind up the propellear
2733,hello,ello
2734,what's important is the body the propeller and what the string and what's holding it up,what's important is the body the prepeller and what the stringan was holding it up
2735,well how how big the boat is and how tall it is affects how much passengers it can hold,well how how big the boat isn't how tall it is effects how much passengers it can hold
2736,we've been making paper boats and seeing the capacity and how much passengers they can hold and we've been doing graphs,we've been making papr boats and seem the copassity no how much pasagers they can hold in the wep an doing grafts
2737,well it depends of the size of the boat how much it can hold and how much you would be able to estimate how much you can it could hold,well it depends o the size of the boat how much it can hold and how much you wold be able to ask mar how much you can it out hold
2738,if you change too many at one time then you won't know if you got it right at the beginning or that you had too many change or you had just right amount of change,if you changed too many at one time then you won't know if you got it right at the begining or that you had too many change you had just right mouthchang
2739,well the you can you can find that maybe one it like one boat can hold more passengers th and one can hold less but it depends on the size,well that you can you can find that maybe one it like one boat can hold more pascangeristic and one can hold less but it depends on the size
2740,the higher it gets the more passengers it gets and more capacity it can get,te higher it gets the more passangers that gets in more copascity it can get
2741,what we did here is we we found one,what we did here is we we found
2742,um if you change one variable then the other if it works better or less then you don't have to change the other variable so you only ch so change one at a time,um if you change one veriable than the other if it works better or less than you don't have to change at other verable so you only chsaid change one at a time
2743,we were in charge of seeing how much capacity it can hold and how much pennies we can hold and we did four different sizes of boats so we could see what the difference was,we weren carge of seying how much capasiti  can hold and how much pennies we can hold and we did four different sizes a boat so we could see what the difference was
2744,well on the bottom of the graph is how much the number of passenger no yeah is the number of passengers that it can,well on the bottom of the graft is homuch the number of passnnotyeah is the number of pasengers that e can
2745,well the s smaller the boat is the less passengers it can hold,well the ssmaller the boat is the less passangers it can hold
2746,good,ged
2747,kay yeah,e yeah
2748,well we,well we
2749,that as the capacity gets higher so does the number of passengers,that as the cpascity gets highere so does the number of passengers
2750,well on the bottom is uh how much capacity it can hold and the passengers and then,as usuallthe copassity and the pasengers usually stay rund the same melt and they really don't have some big difference in between
2751,well we put down how much capacity until we get to the highest number and how much the passengers until we got,well we put down how muchcpasity untill we get to the highest umber and how much the passengers untill we gott
2752,well they're putting em in the middle so it can hold more but if you put em all to the side it'll tip over um with less amount in pennies than it actually can hold,well tey'e putting thm in the middle so it can hold more but if you pud mold the side it'll tip over um with less ammot an pendies than it actually can hold
2753,the different size of the cup depends how much capacity it can hold and how many passengers it can hold,the different size of the cup dpens how much pass  e can hold and how many passengers tcan hold
2754,we,we
2755,well we did four different sizes so that we could tell which one could hold more and which one could hold less,well we did four different sizes so that we culd help which one could hold more in wich on could hold less
2756,alright so let's see,i so let's s
2757,that the more capacity it can hold the more passengers,that the more capaste it can hold the more passengers
2758,we did four different sizes of boats so we could tell which so if we did all four the same we wouldn't know if different sizes could hold more or less,we did for different scize of the boat so we could tell which so if we did ll for the same we wouldn't know if  different sizes could hold more or les
2759,you well that the more if you look at the pattern the more the capacity is the passengers always less the capacity it can hold,but tha
2760,it's how capacity is how much water it can hold,its copassityes how much water can hold
2761,it shows you what where the where the the capacity and the passengers meet up on the graph,it shows you what where the where the the capassity and the pasengers met up in the grafft
2762,uh um they're and uh um x and the y are matched up so they're pretty much the same,uh um thei'r boos lising mistings and u um e the w are matched up so they're pretty much the same
2763,well the more you add the passengers the distance will it it won't go as far,well the morning add the passengers the distance will an it won't go as far
2764,so you can um,so yu can m
2765,hello oh my,hello
2766,okay bye,ok by
2767,well we um listed the numbers of passengers and the distance and we realized that the more passengers you have the um it doesn't go as far,well we um listed the numbers of passengers in the distance and wre reallized that the more passengers ou have the um it doesn't go as far
2768,well it's um other side so it'll be easier to list,well place like on theother side it ill be easier to lis thm
2769,we've been making pa we've been making planes and testing um them and seeing we've been changing some variables and seeing what it would do,we've been making papwe've been making pleans and testing um them and seing we've ben changing some veribales and seing what they would do
2770,the number of the numbers that it goes up to the number of passengers and the distance and how far that goes up to,the number off ao  the numbers that it goes up toou the number of passengers and the distance and how far that goes ut t
2771,well you place the y there because it's on the line of the and then it'll be it'll be like right there so you it's easier,well you please ewythere because it's on the line of the red and then it'll be it'll be like n there so yu it's easyer
2772,well x is number of motors or rubberbands and y is the distance,well x is  number of motors the rubber bands and why is the distance
2773,it'll go pretty far,bans ill go pretty far
2774,well we could change like how many rubberbands we had or put on some extra passengers or me and my partner made wings,well we cit changed like how many rubber bands we had or put on some extra passengers or mean my partner made wings
2775,okay,ok
2776,well you can,all you can
2777,well um usually it doesn't matter but you have to like list like the number of passengers and the distance and it doesn't exactly matter what side you put it on though,well um yusually i dsn't matter but you had the lake list like the number of passengers af a distance ind doesnot exactly matter what cide you put it on togh
2778,well that so we could tell which the difference is and it'll be easier to explain,well that so we could tell which to the differences and it'll be easier to explaine
2779,and but he thought it was sixty two milligrams and he thought that it it was monster,and but he thought it was sixty to lligrad sai ind he thought that  it was a monster
2780,a hundred,a hundred
2781,a gram's about as much as a paper clip,um gram's about as much as a paper clip
2782,that there's a hundred grams there,et there's a hundred grams there
2783,milligram weighs as much as i don't know maybe a grain of sugar or a grain of salt maybe i don't know i don't really i'm not sure but,mello gramay is as much as i don't know maybe a grein of suger or a grain of salt maybe i don't know i don't realyin the nett sure but
2784,um mmm let's see,mce
2785,okay,ok
2786,yeah let's see i wanna see the tips i wanna s look at the tips what does i mean,ye let's see i want to see the trips i want ost look at the trips what does i mean
2787,i've been well i didn't know i think but on friday we we just heard about a gram we just heard about a gram like on friday,i've been well thes idn't know i think but on friday we we just heard about a gram we just heard about a gram lik on friday
2788,a hundred,a hundred
2789,okay,in
2790,yeah,yeah
2791,um like having it on there,ummnt like having it on thereon't n
2792,it was the interactive tips,as the intractiv clips
2793,i actually learned that from mother and father because i didn't learn any th uh i haven't learned that that much about grams from my teacher because well we,i leto learned that from my mother and father because i didn't learned anyi haven't learned that that much about grams om my teach er because well we
2794,no,no
2795,um that the net one of the beans equals a gram,um tha the net one of the beans equals a gram
2796,and also i like x and i've also heard exograms my mother and father told me about that and also,and also i like x an i've also heard about xgrams my mother and father told me about that and also
2797,um twenty grams,n twenty grams
2798,um you s the balance would be straight it wouldn't be sorta slanted,um yuth the ballence would be strat it wouldn't be what is lanted
2799,smaller,smaller
2800,a thousand,a thousand
2801,one equals one gram five what's a five five grams it's a five gram,one equal one grm five what's a five five grams sa five c
2802,just weighs as much i mean,dust weas es much ti mean
2803,um paper cli um one side was um,om paper con one side was um
2804,yeah,nea
2805,all of those things went in and the orange weighed more,all of those things went in and the orange waiged more
2806,mmm yeah thousands,yeheah thousand
2807,one side was the,one side was the
2808,okay but i wanna see the interactive chips,ok but i want to see the enterractive ships
2809,um we would add one hundred if it wasn't enough,um we would ad one hundred if it wasn't enough
2810,mmm you could hold it steady there no no oh um,you could hold it study there no no what about um
2811,mmm each side would weigh the same and it would be one line,each side would way the same and it would be one line
2812,milligram is a s thousandth of a gram with a thousandth of a gram,oe melleigramather thousand of a gram waie a thousand of a gram
2813,a hundred beans equals,hundred eanequ
2814,um a a gram is just about as much as a paper clip,um aa gram is just about as bns orpaper lip
2815,different masses i wanna see the different masses,different masses i want to se the different mases
2816,th the th the thing the yeah,tthesnake the thing the alla you
2817,we had to more like that one,we had t more like that one
2818,a hundred grams one thousand,a hundred crams one thousand
2819,um three actually thirty five,three actually  sevety five
2820,we we can add more of that stuff,we we can ad more of that stuff
2821,and we did weigh it with paper clips,and whe did wayit with paper clips
2822,wait,wait
2823,oh those things push out the water and it's wherever this little point is that's how much water is in there,o those things push out the water and iswherever this l point is that's how it's water is in theire
2824,oh a hundred yeah a gram is equal to a hundred of those,oh a hundred yeah a gam is equale to a hundred of those
2825,one milliliter probably equals a millili a millimeter,one milo leader travilig equals ally amilo ether
2826,or depth,good depts
2827,wha what's one milliliter spoo we did that one al we one milliliter spoon i'm wait i need to look at the oh yeah we already didn't miss that,what whats one mi leater spon we did that one awe kew it thigone minut later sp i wait i ned t look at the  yet we already didn't miss that
2828,yeah it's not just it's the height with depth and height and length height with debt and length,e hats not te it'ss height with depth and height and length height with depth and length
2829,um you would find the cup that looked like that and you would pour it in yeah,on you would find the cup that looked like ad and you would poll it inyh
2830,um a hundred,mhundred
2831,th um probably the either the this one or those,thatmaum probably the ether the this one f the os
2832,i'm not i i know it not exactly like that hey was that the next one down i can what is that one,not i i know it like not exactly like that bu hey was that the next one donkin what is that one
2833,liquids the v volume of things,liquids the volume of things
2834,we haven't used with those things yet the teacher has only shown us we did the vial thing and then the teacher also showed us but,we haven't used with ths things yet the teacher has only thown us we did the vil thing and then the teacher has also showed us but
2835,oops,opes
2836,we have to figure out a standard,we have to figure out a standerd
2837,that the only thing that we we again i forgot again where we were,that the only thing that way l wer we again i cot agin where we were
2838,yeah you could lose those things oops,yeu you could do those things oops
2839,a hundred,a hundred
2840,mmm what what what do you say what were you thinking what were you saying,wo what wet w beaing what we is the what woe you saying os
2841,i know but what's f number four it said it was,i know but what's fnumber four it sa thse
2842,over,over

2852,what what what i w um the probably the hundreds,what what what i wa um the probably the hundreds
2853,any liquid,any liquid
2854,what does this mean but i wanna see the um that means a hundred of those equals one of those those are li milliliters i think,ht does this mean hat i want see the um that means a hu red of those equals one of those those are lea midl leaders
2855,okay hey it's going it's going it's doing it it's doing it sed hmm,oky he it's going it's going it's doing at it's doing it said
2856,um the volume it's the amount of it the amount of the stuff,um the volume it's the amount of it the amount of the stuff
2857,i wanna look at more of that stuff i wanna see w wait oh oh yeah a hun ten of those equals one o the liters,n an look at more is at's defthi want to see w oh oh ye a hunten of theots equals one of the leaders
2858,um we came up with using the liter or the meter or the gram,um we came up with using the leater or the meator or the gram
2859,hey can you make this bigger i think you i can,hay can you make this bigger i think you can
2860,le le i wanna do graduated c,let let i want to do gratuate is nu
2861,wait what what were we ta,what what what will you telm
2862,yeah,yeah
2863,liters now can we look at this,leadernow can we look at this
2864,no,o
2865,um with milliliters and also these things um those are each of those is a hundred milliliters,um with milo leaters and also these thingsum those are each of thoses a hundred midloleaters
2866,um you could s measure out,um you could s meter out
2867,um s thousandth,ms thousand
2868,that we sort of did,act b sort of did
2869,well that tells you how much water it is,well that tells you hon wth water  it is
2870,i'll get it,i'll get it
2871,yeah that's,ye that's s
2872,hey i think this is on backwards that's why it's keeps on falling off,haytho this as on backwards that's why it som fallin of
2873,yeah,yeah
2874,yeah no actually we didn't,ah no actaly we didn't
2875,a tenth,attem
2876,the weight,the wait
2877,a milligram no a no no no not a milligr gram a centigram if there was ever such a thing as that a hundredth of a gram,a melliam no i no nno not a mlliggram as centagram if there is every such thing as that a hundred of  gram
2878,before that looked like before sorry gr no not that one w did we do this one,before that looked like before us hurry g no no that one did we do this one
2879,well like well um because then some people say that it's this amount w of vials and some people say it's th a different amount,well likhe well um because then some people say that it's this amount  of vils ind some peoples siy t's a different amount
2880,um prob probably milliliters,mprobly rs lyprobably noble leaders
2881,mmm that's a hundred that's a thousandth of it that's a tenth and that's tenth of it and that's a whole of it,that's a hundred that's a thousandof it that's e tenth and that's a tenth of it and that's a whole of it
2882,oh yeah those,oo s
2883,what,aro
2884,no no neither we haven't done it yet,no no d neither they haven't done it yet
2885,um a hundred milliliters,um a hundred midle leaders
2886,no let's s compare vials yeah that's like what ours were,no let's se compair viles that's like what ours were
2887,mmm wha the what'd you say paying attention i was thinking about this thing,w what d you say i asn't pink densner s thinking about this thing
2888,no no no a gram,no no no gram
2889,that like in the i'm th the thing about,that like in the une thing about
2890,yeah we used that thing,yow we use that thing
2891,then for those you just pour it in for those you pour some you put water in those,and for those whou just pore it in for those you pu some you put water in those
2892,two hundred milliliter graduated cylinders equal what's that,two hundred midle leter grantuated sulendervs equal what's that
2893,yeah,yeh
2894,yeah,d
2895,it's interactive or in soda look see it says orange soda,inteactive r and sod lucks ly it's his oran sota
2896,that's two hundred milliliters but what what is it called is what i'm wondering oh a tray,that's two hundred mile leders but what what is it cald is whatwondering oh tre
2897,yeah,yeah
2898,mmm no no we have one cup and it has an a line a b line a c line a d line,no no we have one cup and it has nt a line to be line in a se line a d line
2899,um how many oh that's a thousand in that big thing in one liter,umhow many oh that's a thous didn't that big thing han the on leader
2900,well because that's one's wide it's too flat and those two out it would be the same size as that,well because that one's wide if you flat in those two ot it would be the same sesthet
2901,what was the soda can the interactive soda can i like the interactive ones aw,wh wis the so cain the interactive sot cani i like the interactive ones
2902,yeah that was a long time ago that was before winter break,yeah that was the long time ago that was before winter break
2903,well by those things on the,will by those things on the
2904,well m l stands stands for milliliters and then the number in front of it that's how many milliliters it is,well am all stowns stands for mil leaders and then the number infront of it that's ho many mole leaders it is
2905,yeah mmm well not well sort of that's sort of like what we did last time,ye mwell no wells sort of that's sort of like what we did last time
2906,we what you do is you have to have you look at where the water's lined up and the one that the water is lined up to is the one that you're,what you do as you have to have you look at wher the water is lined up an the one ha the water ws linked up to his ptt ear
2907,but i wanna look at the int that's the only interactive thing though,but i want to look at that in that's the only intactivin about
2908,milliliters are um are thousandths of a liter they're thousandths of a liter,mill leders are m are thousand of a eader the thousandof e leader
2909,because the vials were different yeah s milliliters,because the viles were different smid leaters
2910,uh huh but i wanna videotape my tonsils,but i want to vitiotat my tonsels
2911,milliliters,mellaters
2912,um fifty most of are graduated cylinders but those ones have a hundred,um fifty n most of our grattuated silenders but those once have a hundred
2913,and you pull water out of the you pull the water out of the cup and into the syringe and then you squirt it back in and then measure the amount of water that was in the cup with the syringe,and you pull water out of the u you pull the water out of the cup and into the srvin andthen you scored it backgin and then you' meer the amount of water that was in the cup with this arange
2914,uh the syringe is a is a thing that sorta sucks up water it's and then it tells you how much is in there that you sucked up,the sarvin is s a thing at sourt o sucks up water it's and then it tells you how much isn there that youe sucked up
2915,and we weren't using vials we l used vials a long time ago,now we weren'tly using viles we used viles a long time ago
2916,wait how is that po pos i wanna look at that again i forgot how how is that possible oh yeah counting the top it was possible,lwit how was that po past i wolnt t look at that again i forgot how how was that possible oh yeah counting the top it was pluss
2917,no but whoa a hundred millili that looks ne equals,no but w hundrednl that looks neat it was
2918,it's the only interactive one,sam ln teractio
2919,one liter,one leader
2920,um um hmm not really,mmnot realy
2921,um oh that one's really well that one is the same as that so that one weighs the same as that other one the middle one that we saw before in that thing and that was two hundred,um oh that one's really well that one is the same as that so that one s the same as that other one the middle one that we saw before and that thing and that was two hundred
2922,syringes yes you just ta i ju hey i just saw a syringe i just saw fifty and we also lews used fifty milliliter ones,cnes es you ist hei tes hey i  saw rin te saw fifty and we also lse used fifty milllater one
2923,maybe that's a wait but there's something a bit in inaccurate there they the it isn't exactly because look see that thing's the same amount wide as that oh it might be l longer that way,but that's ay but ther's something abut an inaccurite there thetdid it isn't exactly because look see that things the same agount why is that oh it might be longer that way
2924,yeah with no,yeah what's now
2925,um well because we wouldn't know if it was exactly two hundred milliliters,um well because he wouldn't know if it was exactly two hundred milelaters
2926,mmm oh yeah we measured our desk with straws,moa we measured her desk with straws
2927,um well,um wel
2928,ten are in one ten millimeters are in one centimeter,ten  oneten millo meters are in one cenc metor
2929,those things marks centimeters okay,those things marks sent meutors ok
2930,okay,ok
2931,um a meter is three point something feet,um a meteor is three point something feet
2932,um it's a meter tape and you write your name there,met u tape and you'e r you' named they are
2933,mmm reading writing and math mainly,reading riding and math mainly
2934,a millimeter,milmater
2935,one ten millimeter equals one teeny centimeter,ne ten metequals one ten he said to me
2936,by to yeah because to be a nine tenth is al i mean two and nine tenths is almost three,close two yerh because three and nine tenth as al i mean two or nine tenth here's almost three
2937,by to it because like most people desks were three by two but mine was two and nine tenths by two,close to it because like most people desks with three bye two but mine was ton nine tenth by two
2938,no the it uh it isn't colored at all,not it do it dosn't color it at all
2939,because my desk seemed shorter than all the other ones at my table,because my desk seemed water and all the other ones at my table
2940,a centimeter is a hundredth of a meter it is a hundred and one meter going all the way,urcent a metor is a hundred of emeedothse a hundred and one neeer ing l tewyaon arther
2941,maybe,maybie
2942,what a scale one millimeter,whit a scl one milo mater
2943,oh well,i will
2944,okay,ok
2945,mmm hmm okay,sua ok
2946,no we just start we just started cutting it out and glued it together,no we'd jes start we just started cutting it out and gle it together
2947,i wanna see what else is there i don't wanna get,i want to see what else is there i don't want to get rid of the
2948,no oh yeah we did we we did,can mak no oh yeah we did
2949,hi look that thing is going look that thing goes,he lk that thing is going  et tink gos o
2950,no we already had rulers but we didn't use them we learned about the metric with meters and centimeters and all the oth and the rest of the world uses,no we alrady had rlers but we didn't use them we larned about the metric with meetors and centry meeters and all the oth in the rest of the world use is
2951,yeah probably,year probably
2952,nope not at all,no not at all
2953,that's wha the red line is one centimeter one two three four five six seven eight nine ten of those,that's  the red line is one sent to beone two three four six iin ten those
2954,whoops aww,y saw bl
2955,no,no
2956,yeah you might color it though i i have no idea we might color it sometime,you might collor it thoh id i'vea no idea at we might collar it sometime
2957,okay,okind yufor
2958,no,no
2959,okay oh this is red,no her her w flashes red

2983,good bye i'm really gonna miss you,goodbye i'm really get a miss
2984,it would pollute it,m it would plod it
2985,that's a really good question and i'm not sure we've studied enough of that to know,um that's a really good question and i'm not sure we've studied enough of that snow
2986,it was pretty quiet i don't think it made any sound,it was pretty quiet i don't think it made any sound
2987,gasoline and coal are nonrenewable energy sources and i do not know what they are called,gasclin and cole arenon renewale energy sources and i do not know what they are cal

2989,can you repeat that,can you repeat th
2990,the candle the wax the candles burning and the wax of the candle is melting,um the candle the waxthe candle is burning and the wax of the candele is melting
2991,it it will pollute the air,it it will palut the air
2992,there's a person playing drums and they are using the energy from their body to play the drums,there is a person playing drums and they are using the energy from their body to play the drum
2993,please repeat that,please repeat b
2994,i'm good how are you,i'm good how are yo
2995,no usually not,no yusually n
2996,like i've said about five times you're being really annoying now is it it will pollute the air,like i've said about five times you're being really annoyingd now is it would up i will plut the air
2997,it would it will basically do nothing except for run the motor and take the energy it needs but it will not pollute the air or anything,it will it will bascically do nothing except for run the moter and take the energy it needs but it would not preluat the air anything
2998,the motor runs,the motor runs
2999,most of the ones that conduct electricity is metal,most of the ones that conduct alectriscity or mettal
3000,good bye,goodbye
3001,i'm good how are you,i'm good how are you
3002,well like i told you before they're mostly metal and made of that,will like a tol dey for their mostly medtal made of that
3003,it tells you that the insulator basically has to be metal,it tells you that the inselater racicay has to be medal
3004,if it's the right material you make an open a closed,if it's the right materal you make it open a close ser
3005,um well to use them in a circuit you it's just basically like a wire,um well to use them in a circet you it's just bace og like a wire
3006,can you please repeat that,can you please repete th
3007,i observed that the motor does not run,i observe that motor does not run
3008,we've been learning about um what kind of materials other than just wires make the circuit run,we've been learning about um what kind of materals other than just wires make the circet run
3009,they're basically made of metal and other kinds of metal,they are baceicclea made of medal another kind of met
3010,you want any of these,you want anyd
3011,it's an open circuit well it's not exactly an open circuit but the wood is not it is an open circuit because the wood is not able to connect metal to metal,it's an open circut well it's not exactly an open circet but the wood is not it is an open circut because the wood is not able to conect medtal to medtal
3012,air food water soil and sunlight,air food water soil in sunlight
3013,um the yeast um eating the graham cracker the little cracker,um the east um eating the gram cracker the cracker
3014,that plants need food to survive that plants do not not not not not not need food to survive,but plants need food to survie thet plants do not not not not not not need food to surviv
3015,plants need air to survive because without air plants would not be able to survive,plants need air to survive because without air plants would not be able to survive
3016,plants making their own food connects to the food webs because a food web there is some plants who make their own food on a food web,plants making nn food canex to the food webs because of food we there some plants to make their own food onfood web
3017,they're the same um wheat but one of them has been grown in the dark and the other one has been grown in the sunlight,the're the same um it but one of them has been grown and the dark and the other one has been grown in sunli
3018,because one of them has not had sunlight no,because one of them has not had sunlight no
3019,because it has air water and sun,because it has air water and sun
3020,well that's those are the materials you need for the experiment,well that's those are the materials you need fear thenoexperiment
3021,yes plants do need sun to survive,yes plants do need son to survive
3022,a healthy plant,a healthy plant
3023,plants need water to survive because they're a living system,plants need water to survive because they ere living sister
3024,uh this relates to the way it looks because it is not getting the sunlight it needs to survive,this relats to the way it looks because it is not getting t sunlight at needs to survive
3025,if producers weren't in the food web,if prorducers weren't o food web
3026,we've been studying um living systems,we've been studing  living sistoms
3027,plants need air to survive because a plant could not survive without air because it needs carbon dioxide to survive,plants need air to survive because a plant cannot survive without air because it needs carndi oxcide to survive
3028,i'm okay,hi okay
3029,i observed that they are one cell organisms,i observe that they are one sell oranisoms
3030,the plant does not have any sun so it can not survive,the plant does not have any son so it can not survive
3031,because they both they've one of em the darker one has been has grown in the dark and the other one has grown in the light,because they both theye one of them the darker when has been has grown in the dark and the other one his grown ind the light
3032,plants do not need fertilizer,plants do not need furtaleize ar to survive
3033,yes because it is a living system,yes because it is a living sistom
3034,this is related to what we were doing in class cause we did this too,this is related to what we are doing in class cause we did this to
3035,yes not getting enough sun could be a problem,yes not getting enough son could be a problem
3036,this connects to what we've talked about in class cause we are growing wheat too,this connect what  talked about in class cause we are growing week to
3037,i think plants need water because plants can't live without water,i think plants need water because plants can't live without water
3038,i think each of the circular cells is um part of the yeast,i think each of those circulor selves is m part of the east
3039,do not need fertilizer to survive because they'll do perfectly fine without fertilizer fertilizer's only given to a plant because they want special growth to happen plants do not need fertilizer to survive,s do not need furtaleizer to survive because they will do perfectly fun without furtaleizer furtalizer is only given to a plant because they want special growth to happin plants do not need furtalightertosurvive
3040,this plant has all the resources it needs,this plant has all the resourses  it me
3041,they make their own food,they make their own food
3042,we know that yeast are one cell organisms,we know that yeath are one sel orgonisums
3043,if producers were not in a food web the food web could not happen,if producers were not in a food web the food web could not happen
3044,because yeast are living systems,because yeaster living sistoms
3045,it is the wind so it's showing us that a plant needs wind to survive,m it is the wind so it's showing us that a plant needs wind to survive
3046,it does not have any water,it does not have any water
3047,well this is an experiment we did,well this is an experiment we did
3048,that the plant is healthy and can live,that the plant is healthy and can l
3049,plants do not need food because they make their own food,plants do not need food because they make their own food
3050,plants do not need food to survive,plants do not need food to survive
3051,plants make their own food through photosynthesis,plants make their own food through poto cencecess
3052,the plant does not have any sun so it can not support so it's it can not live,the plant does not have any son so it cannot support so it is k it cannot live
3053,this plant does not have any water so this can not survive,this plant does not hut f any water so itdos sickly and cannot surv
3054,plants do not need shelter to survive,plants do not need shelter to survive
3055,sunlight,sunlight
3056,the plant does not have any sun so it can not survive,the plant does not have any son so it cannot survive
3057,this is trying to show that plants need sunlight because without sun plants would not be able to do photosynthesis,this is trying to show that plants needs sunlight because without sun plants would not be able to do thoto sinthiic
3058,good bye,goodbye not din tr
3059,no not be missing something because it makes it's own,no not be missing something because it makes  it so
3060,that food webs show show different,that food webs showshow different
3061,that yeast is no longer dormant,the east is no longer adorment
3062,plants make their food through photosynthesis,plants make their food through poto simthecis
3063,this plant has everything it needs so it's growing healthy,this plant has everything it needs so i's growing heify
3064,i know that if a plant didn't have air it wouldn't be able to survive cause it needs c o two to survive carbon dioxide,i know that if a plant didn't have air it wouldn't be able to survive cause it needs ceo to to survive carbondiox
3065,it is showing the plant without air the plant can not survive without air because if it does not have air it can not complete the system it needs,it is showing the plant without air the plant can not survive without air because if it does not have ai it cannot plt this compleet ths sistom n y
3066,um electricity has to be able to flow all the way through the light bulb,um electriscity has to be able to flow all the way tur the light ball
3067,well i i'm i think that the light bulbs will get dimmer,well i i'm i think that the light bulbs will get dimmer
3068,well i think that the light bulbs will light up and become more they will become a lot brighter when we put another battery in,well i think that the light bulbs will lighte up and become more they will become a lot brighter when we put another batterend
3069,well it has to flow out of the battery through the first light bulb into a few wires through the second light bulb and more wires and into a battery,well it has to flow out of the battere throgh the first light ball binto a few wires through the second lght ball o more wires and into a battery
3070,um the electricity always flows out of the plus side into the light bulb and into the wires,um the electricity always plows flows out of the plussside into the light ball and through the wires
3071,um i do not quite understand that question could you please maybe try repeating it in a different way,um i do not quite understand that question could you please maybe try repeating it in a different way
3072,well um i think that when we add more d cells to a circuit the light bulbs will actually last the same amount of time i'm not sure if i'm right but i think they will last the same amount of time,well um i think that when we ad more tetells to a circelt the light bolls will actually last the same amount of time i'm not sure f'me right but i think they willast the same amount of t
3073,um well this is a complete circuit that the energy has a nice pathway to flow,um well this is a compleet turcult that the energy has a nice pathway to flow thr
3074,the energy is flowing into the battery and well it's flowing through the battery through the wire into the light bulb and back out,the ennergy is flowing into the battery and s flowing through the battery trough the wir into he light ballban back
3075,well the series circuit if that's what you mean is all about so it has the wires the two batteries and the two light bulbs or the two motors,well the ceries circu if that's what you mean is all about um so it has the wires the two batteries and the two light ball playn the two motors
3076,bye,
3077,um well they they connect from my thinking about electricity they make me think about um energy the little electricity things it makes me think about electricity,um well they they connect for my thinking about electriscity they make me think about um energy the little electriscity things it makes me thin about electriscity
3078,well we've been working on series circuits the circuits in which two light bulbs are run by one battery or two batteries,well we've ben working on um serieus circuts the circuts in which two light bulbs are run by one batter ay or two batteryes
3079,it is flowing through one d cell battery,it is flowing through one deesail battery
3080,i'm very good how are you,i'mvery good how are you
3081,there is one complete pathway but there can be more in some situations but not very many there's really just one pathway,there is one compleet pathway but there can't be more in some situations but not very many there's there's really just one path way
3082,they are well the positive is facing the positive and the negative is facing the negative,they are well the pousitive is facing the positive and the negutive is facing the negutive
3083,um well they're important because they're what is made up of a simple circuit,um well the're important because they are wetes made up of a simple circu

3134,it benefits the skunk by it it benefits the skunk by scaring away predators,it benifits the stunk by um it it benifits the stunk by scaring away creddetors
3135,i'm good how are you,i'm good how are you
3136,cause the snake rattling its tail is the stimulus and the girl backing is her reaction,scause the snake raddling its tail as e stimuluss and the girl backing wes her re action
3137,one of it's adaptations is its shell which protects it which benefits the animal because it will protect it from predators and bad weather,one of its adatations is a shell which protects it which benifits the animal because it will protect it from pretors in bad weather
3138,well it's an adaptation since it's bad odor and it scares predators and things away,well it's an atiptation since it's bad odor and it scares predetors and things away
3139,we've been learning about animals their and their communication sight and their other senses,we could learn about animals their comutan their comunication sight and go other senses
3140,benefits the turtle by protecting it from harsh weather and predators,benifits the turtle by protecting it from harsh leather and predetors
3141,the coyote could smell and think it smells bad so he would run away,the cyoi could smell it and think it smells bad so he would run aw
3142,it connects to what we've been talking about because it's it's the skunks odor is the adaptation,it connexed to what we've been talking about cause it's it's it's a the um scunks oder is the ateptat
3143,the person is backing away or becoming scared and the rattlesnake is rattling its tail as a warning,the peron s um backing away or bin becoming scared and the raddle snakeis raddling its tailes a warning
3144,because lions need meat to survive so,because um lions need meet to survive so u
3145,well the skunk is the stimulus letting off odor and the odor is the stimulus actually making the coyote probably run away eventually because of the smell,r the stunk is the stimuluss letting off oader and the odors the stimuless actually making the cyoty probly run away eventually cause of thi sme
3146,the stimulus well it is please repeat that,this temuless wllit is please re peet thout
3147,well it will blend in to different like the coral behind it and things so you can't see it if you're swimming you can't see it very easily that is,well it will blend in to different like the corel behind itthings so it you can't see it if you are slimming can't see it very easily that is
3148,it's the behavior where it it's not instinct it's their response to the cold winter,it's the behaviere where it's it's not instinctd it's the responce to the cold winter
3149,well the snake's the stimulus to the person and the reaction is like to get scared and back off,well the snakes the stimuluss to the person and the reaction is like to get scared an back
3150,yes,yes
3151,well the stimulus for the human is the rattlesnake and its tail and the human's reactions is to step away,testimuluss for the human is the raddle snake ind its tal and the humans re action is step away
3152,i'm not very well how are you,i'm not very well hr you
3153,the wings because it's telling them the butterfly is toxic,the wings because it's telling that the butter flyes talk sick
3154,scares away predators the smell scares away the predators,gets away predetors the mell scares way predtetors
3155,the skunk is letting off odor to scare away the coyote so the coyote does not eat it,this scunk is letting off oder to scare away the cy so the cyo does not eat it
3156,the rattlesnake is rattling its tail to tell the human not to come close cause it might strike the human and it thinks the human is a predator,the ratddle snake is raddling its tail to tell the human not to come close cause it might strike the humand and thinks the human is a preaiti
3157,we've been learning about animal vision sight and hearing and communication,ben learning about animals vision sight and hearing in comunicat
3158,this is a non learned behavior because the turtles when they're born out of their shells they know that they have to go to the ocean,this is a nomlind behavieure because the turtles when they're born out of their shelles they know that they have to go to the ocean
3159,the cat is falling from a tree but it sits in it's non learned but it just naturally shifts it's shifts itself around to land,the cat is falling from a tree but its its in it's nonlearned that it just natually shiftsits shifts itself around to land
3160,bye,b
3161,the the snake is scaring away the person cause it thinks the person is a predator,the the snake is scaring away the person because it thinks the person is a preddettour
3162,number two because it's their teeth and it will bite into the meat and so it kills the animal,number two because it's their teeth and it will bite into the mat and so it kills the animal
3163,bye,by
3164,the number two the flipper the paddle on its foot,thenumber to the flipper the patddal on its fo
3165,well in my own word,l in my own word
3166,the number two the flipper the paddle,the number to the flipper the paddal
3167,this is like an the turtle has a shell and that's its adaptation and the fish has a pattern and that's its adaptation and the skunk has the odor and that's its adaptation,um this is like an am the turtle has a shell and that's its atdeptation hand the fish has a pattern and that's its atdeptation and the skunk has the otor amounts its atteptatio
3168,because it well,because um it well it
3169,this is showing animals we've been learning about and like their sight hearing and senses,this is showing animals we've been learning about and like their ate hearing nsensces
3170,for an adaptation this animal has the camouflage pattern,for an atiptation this animal has the caa fleish pattern
3171,i think this is a reflex because yeah,um i think this is um reflects ecause yah
3172,it probably makes predators think it's toxic or toxic or something,it probably makes pe pretetors think it's talk sic or talk sick or someth
3173,well the canadian geese are flying in a v and it's just all the it's just the stimulus and reactions basically,well the conaidion ges are flying an a ve and it's just all that it's the stimulussin re action spacicl
3174,the smell so the skunks reaction no the skunks smell will ward off the coyote cause it smells bad,this smell so a scunks re action or the stunks smell will war it off the ciode because it smelts bad
3175,this is all about like just a stimulus and response,this is all about like just e stemmuan respontcs
3176,because ducks swim and so they need flippers to swim,because ducks swim and so they need flippers to swim
3177,it's showing animals defend themselves,it's showing how animals defend therselves
3178,this is a learned behavior,this was e learned behaviour
3179,they are i don't quite know,they are i don't quaint now
3180,the difference is that an instinct is just doing something naturally and a reflex is reacting to something,he difference is that instint ist just doing something natually no reflecs is reacting to something
3181,the coyote could run away so it didn't have to smell the odor anymore,the um kiotie could run away so it didn't have to smell est oator an
3182,well it's a skunk warding away a coyote with its smell,well it's a stunk wording away a kyotie with it smell
3183,number two because it's showing it's warning predators that the butterfly is toxic,number to because it's showing swarning creddetors that thet butterfly is taxick
3184,because it will bite the prey and not kills it if it bites it in the right place,because it will bite the pray and nat kills it if it bites it in the right place
3185,because it the butterfly is toxic and predators do not want to eat toxic prey,because it the butter flies talk sick and pretetors did not want to eat talksic pray
3186,this has to do with what we've been talking about cause this is a rattlesnake warding off a girl telling her that he's dangerous cause the rattlesnake thinks that the girl's the predator,this has to do with what we'v been talking about cause this is um a ratdle snake loding off a girl telling her that he's dangerous cause the reddle snake thinks that the girl is the preaddeto
3187,it's teeth,itsteeth
3188,this has to do with what we've been talking about because this is all the stimulus and reactions of animals,as has to do with what we've beent alking about because this is all the stimuluss and re actions of animals
3189,well well we've been learning about how they have different things to survive and protect themselves,wll wellla in learning about how they have different things to survive and protect themselves
3190,yes,yes
3191,the um the flag would not run cause there is no solar energy or energy that it can pick up from the sun the clouds all block the,the um the flag would not run because there's no soller anergy or eanergy that it can pick up from the sun the clouds i'll block the
3192,um it means that the motor is on,um it means that the motor is on
3193,if the sun is out yeah so energy it's collected into the solar panel and it goes through the wires and into the motor which runs,if the sun is out yea so energy it's collected into the soller pandal and it goes through the wires and into the motor which runs
3194,it stops the electrical flow the electrical flow will end right there at that first little wire,it stops the electrical flow the electrical flow will end right there at that first little wire
3195,the switch needs to connect to one of the wires or it needs to connect to that metal that the wire is holding onto,the swish needs to connect to one of the wires or it needs to conect wit that meddal that the wires holding on to
3196,there must be a complete circuit bringing electricity to the motor and back down into the battery,there must be a compleet circut bringing ellectriscity to the motor and back down into the batter
3197,because it's a full circuit so the electricity can run straight through it and the metal yeah it can run through the metal,because it's a full circet so the electricity can run straight through it and the meddal yea it can run through the meddal
3198,the d cell battery is the wires are connected to it and it's um it's um turning on the motor,the tsell battery is the wires are connected to itin it's um it's um turning on the mot
3199,the switch is um open so the motor will not turn on,this wish is um open so the motor will not turn on
3200,i'm good,i'm good
3201,it's showing the electricity flowing through the battery and up into the motor,its showing the ellectricity flowing through the batter and up into the motor
3202,a it has to have a complete circuit and there has to be enough power in the battery,a comit has to have a compleet circet and there has to be enough power in the batery
3203,can you repeat that please,can you repeat that please
3204,um the d cell the power the electricity coming from the d cell battery through the wires powers the motor,um the desell the powur the electriscity coming from the deetail battery throughthe wires polers the motoer
3205,it is connecting the two metal pieces that the wires are connected to to make a complete circuit,it is connecting the two mettal pieces that the wirs are conected to to make a compliet circet
3206,the motor turns on and the flag starts moving on the motor meaning it's a full circuit now,the moter turns on and the flag starts moving on the moter meaning it's a full circet now
3207,it could if you held a very bright lamp to the solar it could work,it could if you helled a very greigt lamp up to the soler it could work
3208,we've been working on we've been learning about motors so i was hoping today that maybe we could learn about some motors if that's good with you,we've been working on lea we've been learning about motors so it's hoping today that maybe we couldlearn about sem motors if that's good with you
3209,um wires have to connect from the solar panel to the motor,um wires have to conect from the soler panda to the motor
3210,it has to be connected all the way so there can't be a it has to flow all through metal it doesn't flow through plastic or anything so it has to be a complete circuit for the motor to go,it has to be conected all the way so there can't be ait has to flow all through medtal it doesn't flow through plastic or anything so it has to be a compleet circet for the moter to go
3211,the flag stops moving so it can't pick up any sunlight so it stops moving,the flag stops moving mso it can't pick up any sunlight so it stops moving
3212,the motor starts to run,the motor starts to run
3213,electricity is flowing through the wires meaning the d cell battery is powered,electrissity is flowing through the wires meaning the deetail batter is powered
3214,i noticed that the motor runs once they move the switch the motor runs but when i click on it again the motor stops running it's as simple as that,i notice that the moter runs once thy move the swish the moter runs but when a quick on it again the moter stops running so simple is that
3215,bye thank you,by thank you

3370,bye marnie i enjoyed speaking with you,by mongy ienjoyed speaking with you
3371,you should add another gram until it's equal,you should add another gram until it's eag
3372,i'm have to have to think on that you can ask me in a bit,i'm n  have to think o that you cant ask me n obit
3373,yes there is another way you could have used five grams ten grams or twenty grams but it would mo most likely be five grams,yes there is another way you could  used five grams tengrams or twenty grams but it would m most likely be five grams
3374,thank you for the comment that i have made some good observations,thank you for the coment that i have made some good servations
3375,we've been doing um well we've been measuring oranges and apples rocks and legos,we've been doing um well we've been measuring oranges and apples rocks and legrs
3376,i'm good,i'm good
3377,yes there is,yes there is
3378,the best sized pieces to add would be twenty grams or ten grams,the best scized pieces to ad would be twenty grams or ten grams
3379,that is true,that is true
3380,i ob observed that the coin would be um heavier than just one gram,i obobserved that the cin would be um heavier than just one gram
3381,you can add five grams again and again um til you get the right answer,you can
3382,well these objects are about weight and how like well basically weight and size,well these objects are about wight and how like well bacicay wight and size
3383,um you i really don't know,um you i really don't know
3384,marnie i didn't hear you could you please say that again,marnie i didn't hear you could r plese say that again

3386,it's an import marnie i didn't hear you very well,it's importmarney i didn't heat it very well
3387,we've been doing temperatures and we've been sticking our fingers in water and to see what it wa,we've been doing temperatures and we've been sicking our fingers in water and to see what itw
3388,we never mentioned dan bridger in because i'm in a different math class as somebody else he was in a different math class and so yeah,we never mentined dam bridger nd because i mee frnt m clas is somebody ouse here was in a different moclos and so ya
3389,marnie i have to go bye,monney i have to go by
3390,temperature,temperature
3391,marnie you have to leave me a minute for to um to think for okay,wai you have to leave me a minute for the um thnk for ok
3392,it's been nice talking to you too i'll see you next time,it's been nice talking to you too i'll see a next time
3393,i'm good marnie,i'm good money

3396,um that um we are putting our fingers in water and,that um the hors son on the screen is putting his fingers in water
3397,marnie i did not hear you,ohny i did not hear you
3398,um marnie you're gonna have to give me a moment to think on that,u money you can have to give me a moment o think on that
3399,well not really i think you are pretty,well not realay i think youre pretty
3400,pretty good,pretty good
3401,um the rubber band is untwining and that's how the plane goes,um the rubber band is on twining and that's how the plane goes
3402,it is fun,it is fun
3403,we um put it the airplane on a straw and twisted the propeller and that made it fly,we um put it the eairplayine on a straw and twisted the preopeller and that made it fly
3404,as our teacher calls the two straws there's one that's clear and they call that the super straw and the other one the super big straw,as ar teacher calls the two straws there's one that's clear and they calld that the super straw and the other one the super big straw
3405,you need to think about how many times you turn the peller,you need to think about how many times you turn the pellar
3406,um the rubber band and the rubber band twists and it let go lets go of the propeller,um the rubber band and the rubber band twists and it lck let's go wo the prepellar
3407,pretty good um it's a little awkward talking to a robot though i guess,pretty good um it's s a little okward talking to a robot though i guess
3408,um you twist the,um you twist te
3409,if you don't have a propeller it won't go anywhere and if you don't have a rubber band it won't turn the propeller,if you don't have a prepeller it won't go anywhere and if you don't have a rubber band it won't turn the prepeller
3410,we have been creating um airplanes and um flying them on wires,we have ben creating um airplaines and um flying them on wires
3411,i appreciate your help with my science thanks,i oprechiate your help with my cience thanks
3412,you need to be consistent with how many turns you do and if it doesn't go far enough you need to twist the propeller more,you need to be consistan't with how many turtls you do and if it doesn't go far enough you need to twist the prepeller more
3413,r and that's ter spin,er and that' t spin
3414,you just twist the propeller and let go and it flies if you twist the propeller twenty five times,youd just twist the prepeller and let go and it flies if you twist the prepeller twenty five times
3415,me and my um friend that helped me do the plane didn't really have any problems,me and my um friend that helped me do the plane didn't really have any problems
3416,um what works together is,um what works together i
3417,predicting is all about thinking of something that's going to happen,prodicting is all about thinking of something that's goine to happen
3418,i noticed that it's going much faster than the last one,i notice that it's going much faster than the last one
3419,one says that the the number of swings and the other says the pendulum length i think that's important,one says that thet the number of swings and the other says the pinrlen length i think that's important
3420,that's an x and a y axis,that's an ex in a wide axess
3421,you can figure out h how many swings that each length has,you can figure out how many swings that each length has
3422,yes we did this in class and i don't think the pennies matter if you add them on or not,yes we did this in class and i don't think the pennies matter if you ad them oor not
3423,p predict,ppdict
3424,it,it's all about
3425,the information is important because you couldn't think without the information,the imfermation is important because you couldn't think without the imfrmation
3426,there is a large space in between there and it kind of looks like something's missing,there is a large space n between there and it kind it looks like somethings miscing
3427,it was the same there was no not really a difference,it was the same there was no not really a differenc
3428,every time,the imfermation on the grafft tells you that
3429,one has to do with the pendulum length and the other has counts the number of swings the pendulum does,one has to do with the pengelan length and the other has counts the number of swings the pendelem does
3430,you should use a string that is the length of one hundred and forty centimeters,you should use a string that is the length of one hundred and forty cenimeators
3431,see you some other time,to ou some other time
3432,each number of swings makes the graph go down by,the length of the string
3433,we've been learning about pendulums and we made graphs about them,we've bee learning about pindlums and we made grafs about them
3434,i mean swings,i mean swings
3435,i don't think so i think the graph is perfect now,i don't think so i think the graff is perfect now
3436,good,good
3437,the data goes downwards,the data goes downwards
3438,i would guess that it would go approximately seven swings,i would guess that it would go a proximatally seven swings
3439,if your string is really s long you have less a less number of strings,if your string is reallased long you have less a less number of strings
3440,we've been learning about,we've been learning about
3441,i think it should go somewhere in between the fi the third and the second to last dots,i think it should go somewhere in between the the third and the second to last dots
3442,so that you have an even variables you know what's causing problems if there are problems,so that you have an even verioblesyou know what's caausing problems if there are problems
3443,um you're changing different variables i think,m you're changing different verables i think
3444,um we have been um testing the catapults and flicking corks,um we have been um testing the cattapults and flicking corks
3445,they're about changing something that change something else,there about changing something to change something else
3446,the small aluminum ball is staying the same also,the small arthoaman inbuled is staying the same also
3447,good bye,by
3448,to make sure that you got the experiment right,to make sure that you got the experiment right

3451,okay,k
3452,yes,yes
3453,launcher base,long o your bace
3454,if you get an inaccurate result you should s um make sure you know what that is and not do a variable,if you get an in accurit result you should sum make sure you know it what that is and not do veriable
3455,we kept the ball size the same,we kept the botl size the same
3456,you can find out that um the farther you stick the popsicle stick out um the farther it goes,you can find out that um the farther you stick the pobtical stick out um the farther it goes
3457,um what's going on is the is going up and down,um what's coling on is the degr is going up and down
3458,you'll get um an even result,you li um and even result
3459,you can sometimes get a different result,you can sometimes get a different result
3460,if you change more than one it will mess up the experiment,if you change more than one it will nescup the experiment
3461,um the independent variable is the length it grows as the distance grows,um the indipendant very buld is the length it grows as the distance grops
3462,we've been doing things with catapults,we fin doing things with cattbuls
3463,um it's what's important to keep the variable the same is that you don't change more than one,um it's what's important to keep theveriable thecame is that you don't change more than one
3464,the angle is staying the same,the angle is studying the same
3465,the less farther it goes,the list farther it goes
3466,okay,ok
3467,hello,odo
3468,okay it tells you that um,bacicly it tells you that how far the plane gos when you have how many river beands on the um plaine
3469,it's a graph and um,i don't know what it's about because it doesn't have a title yet
3470,thank you,thank you
3471,if you um,if you uhm
3472,add across in the um,at a cross in the um
3473,um graphs help you determine how things work in um when you change them how that affects it,um grafts help you deturmin how things work and um when you change them how that effects it
3474,i think about um how many motors you put on and the distance and where i should put the different dots,i think about um how many moters o put on an the distance and where i should put the different dots
3475,we've been doing plain graphs for our science class,we've been doing plain grafts for um cince class
3476,every time i do a test i put a dot where the i should put the dot on the graph,everytime i do a test i put a doct where the i should put the doct on the graff
3477,how much something can hold and how far it goes when you put it on,how much something can hold and how far it gos when you put it on
3478,that the um number of passengers goes up,that the um number of pasengers gos up
3479,that's the distance the plane flies when you add a certain number of motors,that's the distance the plaine flies when you add a certain number of motors
3480,um if you wait,um if  you wait
3481,it tells me that if you add more motors the distance increases,it tells me that if you add more motors the distant inc incrieces
3482,good,good
3483,well if you make the um number of winds more um it'll go farther,well if you make the um number of wines more um it will go farther
3484,i think incremental change is when you add something something either decreases or increases,i think incramental change is when you add something something either decreces or increces
3485,hi,hi
3486,that names the x and the y axis,that names the ex in the wise axces
3487,number of winds and number of passengers,i see agraf with on
3488,it is um parallel to the y axis,it is um parelel to the wie axcess
3489,the x axis tells you the number of m um rubberband motors there are,the exaxcess tells you the number of um rubber band motors are

3513,to a solution,tolut a sallution
3514,good,but
3515,that shows that a solution is a mixture where the solute or the solid dissolves in the solvent or the liquid,that shows that um a salution is a micture where the solu or the solid desolves in the solthe or liqui
3516,it is a mixture because you can separate it using a filter,it is a mixture because you can seporat it using a filtur
3517,the water would be the solvent because it's a liquid,the water would be desolven because te lick
3518,we we've been learning about mixtures and solutions in chemistry,we we've been learning about um mixtures and sallutions and kmmistur
3519,it dissolves,it deso
3520,okay,k
3521,producers are plants consumers are animals and decomposers are things that we might call plants like mushrooms and bacteria but they really just eat a bunch of dead stuff worms are also decomposers,produces our plants consumers oure animals and de composers ore things that we might call plants like mushrooms in backtariea but they really just eat a bunch of ded stuff warms are also te composers
3522,dead plants and animals,es boog plants an animal
3523,consumers are animals so consumers can't make their own food,and sumers at animals so consumers can't make their own food
3524,is a food web and food webs are ecosystems basically,is af food web and food lebs are equal sistms bacil
3525,because making your own food means that you produce food for yourself and then you become food for other animals,because making your own food means that you produce food for yourselves and then you become food for other animals
3526,been learning about living organisms and how to wake them up like wheat and yeast,e as ben nameabout living work and mdiconsand how to weak them op like weat in theast
3527,good how are you,goody
3528,food webs and food chain,food weps and food chain
3529,to be a consumer means you don't make your own food you just eat other smaller consumers or you eat producers,to be a conser means you don't make your own food you dit eat other smaller conumers o you eat producers
3530,they eat producers and then sometimes they'll eat other consumers,they eat producers and then sometimes the'll eat other consummers
3531,just tell me i can't remember what we're studying in this unit,just tell me i can't remember what we're studding dering tiss younit
3532,they do because if you performed a they would need it would show that they needed carbon dioxide to live,they do because if you porform a tas they would need um it would show that they needed carbin dio sid to live
3533,definitely,definately
3534,it shows a home,i it shows a hone
3535,the sunlight is shining on the chlorophyll where the water's coming up to the roots and it's on the leaves and that's creating a sugar that goes throughout the whole body,the sunlight is shinted on the cloifill wheare the water's coming up tro the roots and it's meanting on the leaves and that's creating a shuger that goes through out the whole body
3536,that i'm done with you,that i'm done with po
3537,it shows a home,it shows a home
3538,the sunlight the well the light,the sunlight ta w the light
3539,they do using photosynthesis,they do using otals sinc le ses
3540,yes plants do need water to survive because they the water,yes plants junnd  water to survive because they the wat
3541,plants give off oxygen which humans need to survive and they need the carbon dioxide which humans give off to survive,plants give off oxygen wheich human need to surrive and they need the carbin die off side which humans give off to surrive
3542,they are the yeast cells,are te yeathsos

3547,that they are living when you give them what they,that thea're living when you give them whon the
3548,sunlight and water,sunlight and water
3549,definitely to create photosynthesis they need the sun water and the air,definately to create oto cin to this they neean the sun water in the air
3550,plants it's nice for them if they have a shelter but like i keep saying plants in the wild don't really have one,ands it's nice for them if they hav a shelter but like i keep saying plants in the wild don't really have one
3551,well the fact is it creates its own food so have you ever heard of plant food well i didn't and i don't think we feed them hamburgers,well the fact is its creates its own food sou have you ever heard of plant food well i didn't and i don't think we feed them hair purkrs
3552,not necessarily because plants that are in the wild don't always really have,not necesearly because plant are in the whild don't always really have fur
3553,it's showing the wind,it's showing the wind
3554,you're giving the yeast a,you're giving e ease
3555,it's showing photosynthesis,a and shelling photo sinthoci
3556,the yeast is a living organism and you're giving it what it needs to survive,the yeast is a living orgonisom and the you'e giving it what it needs to survive
3557,it's asking you if they need sunlight to survive,it's asking youif they needs sunlight to survive
3558,well it can't really do very well without any sun,um well it can't really cdo very well without any son
3559,that they're single celled organisms and when they are given the water they produce an amount of gas that extended the bag,that there were single selles orgonisam and when they would give him the water they produced in amount of gass that exdidn'tid the bag

3564,it it has no water,it it has no water
3565,it's been deprived of air,it's been deprived of air
3566,it has all three factors it needs to survive now it's recess time so please stop asking me questions,it has all three factors its needs to survive now it'so reces times so please stop ask him  questi
3567,it's a bunch of little organisms floating around in water,it's a bunch of little organisoms floating around in water
3568,well we've already classified that it needs water air and sunlight and if it's not getting the air well that's not working out very well for it,well we've already classifyied that it needs water aigr in sunlight and if it's not getting the air well that's not working ut very well for it
3569,plants need water to survive because they need it for the process of photosynthesis,bans need water to survive because they mad it for the pprosesse of o to sin the ses
3570,no because plants in the wild where they can't get fertilizer survive just pretty well on their own,asno because plants in the wild where they can't get firta lives ers arrived just pretty well of their own
3571,cause i've been telling you all day,en as i've been telling you all tay
3572,it's saying that this plant has had water air but has been deprived of sunlight and showing how it looks,it's saying that this plant has had water air but has been deprived of sunlight in showing how it looks
3573,do because we learned it in science class,do because wev learneded in sciencc
3574,it's growing perfectly because it has all three things it needs,than it's growing perfectly because it hase all three things it needs
3575,that the plant needs the same things as yeast,um that the plant needs the same things as east
3576,well it's showing that it's deprived of sunlight and it needs sunlight to survive,b it showing that's deprived of sunlight and it needs sunlight to urr
3577,it's has no carbon dioxide so it's turning orange,it's had no um carbn dy oside so it's turning rond

3583,in both you're mixing and creating a mixture of the solid and a liquid,in both you're mixing m and creating a mixture of the solid and a liquid
3584,there are nuts there are candy and there are raisins and the nuts the candy and the raisins were all mixed together and you separate the mixture,there are not theare candy and there are reasos and the nat's the candy and the rasons were all mixed together and then you seporated the mixtu
3585,the sand falls to the bottom,the sand falls to the bottom
3586,it dissolves,it desolvs
3587,you were separating a mixture by putting the small water particles through the thingy so that way the marbles would separate from the water,you were supporating a mixture by putting the small water particles through the thine so that way the marbles would sepporate from the water
3588,first you would have to put it together,first do ild have to put it together
3589,the grape and the water mixed together and the grape dissolved and it colored the water,te grape and te um water mixe together and the grape desolved andn't color the water
3590,dissolving,desolving
3591,oh it's definitely a solution,s definitely a sillution
3592,good,good

3693,the wires are connecting the battery to the light bulb and that makes it a complete circuit,the wires are condecting the battery to the lightball and that makes it a compleet circuet
3694,one wires touching the positive side of the battery another wires touching the negative side of the battery the other side of the negative wire is touching the casing the other side of the positive wire is touching the base,um one wiere touching the positive side of the battery another wire touching the negtive side ftebattery the other side of the negotive wire is touching the casing te arte side f the pos of wires touching te base
3695,cause the moving blue dots are acting like energy,cause the moving blue dogs are acting like eneargy
3696,three,three
3697,it flows in the casing out the bottom of the bulb or out the base of the bulb in the casing of the other bulb out the base of that bulb and back into the battery,it flos in the ca siing out the bottom wif the ball or out the bace of the ball in the cassing of the other ballb out the bace that ballb and back into the batter remar
3698,wires but when it comes to light bulbs it is flowing through the light bulbs through that wire and in through the other light bulb back to the battery,wires but it um when it comes to the light bobs it is flowing through the light bubs through that wire and through the other light bl back to the battery
3699,energy,energy
3700,how to make two light bulbs run run at once,m how to make two lihte bubs want run at once
3701,where did the microphone go the d the batteries are running out they are yeah running out,wheream im the t the batteriyes are running out they are m yeah  running out
3702,marney,to lose money
3703,just turn one of the batteries around,m us turn one f te betteryes around we
3704,now the the batteries are correctly and energy's flowing,um now thee the bettersis quickly and el an energis flowing
3705,the light would not be as dim and they would be more bright,the lights would not because tim and they would be more bright
3706,good,good
3707,they will all they will get dimmer and dimmer and dimmer and dimmer until they don't work anymore,they wi they ill get dimmer and dimer and dimer until they don't work anymor
3708,when the two negatives are touching the two positive are on the other,um when the two niggitives are touching the two postives ore on the other s
3709,they all have to be touching like they all have to be connected or else it is not a complete circuit,theythey all have to be touching like they all have to be connected or elsce it is not a compleet circut
3710,there will be more energy so therefore the bulbs will glow brighter,there will be more anergy so therefore the bus will groow briter
3711,well in a basic circuit there's an energy source usually like a connector like wires and a receiver,us well in a bacic circat there's an anagy source um usally like u connector like wires um and a recever
3712,energy can not flow through wood so therefore there can not be energy that gets to the other side of the motor,anergy can not flow through wood so there for theyre can not be ennergy sadgege to the other side the mote
3713,when there's a plastic object it does not work,a when there is a wod or plstick object it does not w
3714,five objects make it run and one two three and five do not,five objects make it run and one o dand five do non
3715,the motor has no movement,the moger has no move it
3716,energy can not flow through wood so therefore there there's no energy reaching the other side of the wire so the motor can not go,um energy can not flow through r wood so there fore the there's no energy reaching the other side f the wir so thoh moter can nok a b
3717,marney don't leave me don't leave me good bye marney see ya tomorrow,barny got d money feed o mrl a
3718,most insulators are made out of like sponge or plastic or paper or wood or something like,um most intilaters are made out of like um spunge or plastic or paper or wood or something like d
3719,the,so
3720,open,open
3721,insulators are materials that are not metal and energy can not flow through them,intiplaters um are um materials that are not metal and annergy can not flot thrum
3722,conductors and insulators or what are conductors and what are insulators,um conjucturs and instalaters are what are conductors and what are insilla
3723,marney do you like my sponge,money do you like my spunge
3724,good,dead
3725,when a metal object or a conductor is connecting the switch to the wires oh that's cool the motor runs,when a medal object or a conductor is connecting te swich to the wer pcum the moter run
3726,the straw is made of plastic so therefore it is an insulator,the straw is made a plastic so there fore it is a a alta h
3727,marney what am i supposed to do,morningmarta what a't y supose to do
3728,um energy is going out of the negative side of the battery and into the positive side of the battery energy is flowing through the wires,um ennergy is going out of the negotive side f the batter and in to the aroom said thebatter energy is blowing thru the wires
3729,um well the solar cell is absorbing the energy from the sun and using it to make the uh uh motor,um well the soller sell is absorbing tennergy from the sun and using it to make the uh u motorr
3730,it has to be facing the sun,atach will be facing the son
3731,you have to close the switch you have to move the switch,you have to close the swish you have to move the swish
3732,the wires are connected to the positive and negative side of the battery so it is making the motor spin,the wieres are condected to the posit of a niggutive side f the beatter he so it is making the moter spi
3733,the circuit does not the circuit does not have the amount of energy it needs,the circet does notte the circet does not have the amount of ennergy it need
3734,what's your last name,what's your last name
3735,the battery produces energy through the wires so that the motor can run,the battery produces ennergy throwgh the wires so that the moter can run
3736,the thing spins so it would be a closed,the thing spind so it would be a close s
3737,um the it it can not run,um thi t it can not run
3738,the flag is spinning or it has movement because the battery is producing its energy to the motor,the flag is spinning or it has a movement because the batter is producing its energy to demotor
3739,when it is touching that metal part it the motor is when it is not it does not run,when it is touching nat meddal part it the moter  when it oes nt it does not run
3740,um well the solar cell is absorbing the sun and the wires coming out of the solar cell are connected to the motor so then that would make the motor run,um well the sor sellws absorbing the sun sand the wirs were coming out of the sore shell ar condected to the moter so then that would make the moter um run
3741,it would like anything it's connected to would not run or light or any of that,it would like anything its connecte tue would not run or light or anyoth
3742,well i can see is in this photo is that there is a d cell battery a a motor wires and a switch,well i can see as the at this photo is that there is a dse battery u a comotor wires and a swish
3743,the solar cell has to be in sunlight,the souller sell has to be in sunlight
3744,magnificent,magnifhicent
3745,when the sun is out the solar cell absorbs the sunlight it turns it into energy so that the motor,wwhen the sun is out the soer sell absorbs the sunlight it turns iniinedres so that the moterc
3746,no,no
3747,have a good day,have a good day
3748,it is open so that means it would be a closed circuit,it is open so theat me n do  be a closed circet
3749,the the flag just stands still it does nothing except just stand still there,the flug the flag dos stand still and yet it does not thing except you stand still there
3750,how to um make a motor run,how to make a moter run
3751,the motor does not run because the solar cell there is no sunlight shining on it so it can not absorb the energy to use it as energy,the moter does not run because the souller sell there is no sunlight shining on it so it can not obsorb the energy to use it as an ennerg
3752,you have to have wires connected to the positive and the negative side of a battery and those wires have to be connected to a motor,you have to have wires condected to the positive ante negotive side of a batery and those wires have to be condected to a moater
3753,when the switch is open the motor does not run,when the swish is open the moter does not run
3754,the electricity is flowing out of the negative side of the light bulb and the electricity is flowing out of out of the base of the light bulb and flowing into the positive side of the d cell,thelericity is elling out of the neagitive sigte in t ligh bolbd and the lis a use like out of the b of the baslighe bub ind falling into the paretive side of the deeville
3755,the wires um wait travel source for the battery to go to the light bulb,the wires u travmake the atravels s for the batton to go to the lit balb
3756,i notice that the energy is still coming out of the negative side of the battery up into the light bulb,i notice that thaitedo't s still coming out of the neiggoeside of the battery up into the light boalt
3757,um well a filament inside there it gets hot so it produces light so the energy of the battery,um we fin that instead there they get hart so fs the might from the eneargy of the battery
3758,good,d
3759,well they're the receivers so so they um it is the receiver so it it receives the energy to make it light i,a barecavers o so they um it it is the receaver soit receeved the energy to make it light i g
3760,the batteries are the energy source they that what gets the energy to make the bulb light,but batters o the innergy saurs they mat that' t gi the energy to make the bulb light
3761,it means that it takes the energy out of the d cell and it lights the bulb like bing,it means that it sakes the ennergy out of the deps u and it likes te bulb like the
3762,electricity goes out of the negative side into the battery and electricity comes out of the battery into the positive side,acwist gos out of the neaggutive side into the battery and afexpe comes out of the battery in the positive si
3763,light bulbs are the receivers they're the one that those are the things you're trying to light,light bub are the receevers thee te one that you'r thosea the things that youre ging to light
3764,like how to make the circuit work,like how to make the curpat work
3765,uh what do you mean,a what do you mean

3771,i notice that now the light bulb lights and if i change it back it will not light,i noticed that now the ligt pub light to the fin n get back it wol not l
3772,the negative side,don neggutive side
3773,well the energy is coming out of the base of the light bulb is coming towards the positive side of the battery and into the positive side of the battery,wll i tut energy is coming out of the ball at the bace of the light balb tit's coming towards be posit was id o the battery and int the positit side of he battery
3774,they carry the energy from the d cell and to the bulb,tey ca the eniny from the beasa and he bulb
3775,um the energy continues coming out of the positive side of the or the negative side of the battery,umthe tangy continus coming out of the positive side of the bar the neggutive sideof the batteo
3776,an energy source or a battery,an annergy source or a battery
3777,a bulb a d cell battery and some wires,a bub a piece of beattery and tm wires
3778,wires are the they travel they it's the travel source of energy they go through the energy from the d cell goes to the wires so it can light the bulb,waers are  they travel theybe it the traveor enearg they go through the wire the ennerg from the desoethe vions and so it cu like the bo
3779,uh um well the d cell is the source of energy that you need to light the bulb,u uh well the dec is the sorce of eannigy that you need to like the bulb
3780,it would not light,it would not like
3781,that the wires must that one wire must touch the negative side and that one wire must touch the positive side,that the wieres must that one mier must touch the neggutive sid and he one wier must touch the parsitive sid
3782,well you connect the wires to the bottom the base or to the casing and you connect the other two sides to the positive and the negative side of the battery,well you connect the vyrs t the bat of the bs and to the cain when we conect the other two sihes the positive and the naggoutive igt of he battery

3820,it's all the different parts that they move together to make a system to make it go or work or run,it's all the different parts that they moved together to make a sistom to make it go or work or ru
3821,it is a car and it has a system and that is how it runs,it is a car and it has a sistom and that is how it wrun
3822,it is a a car system like like it's a system makes the car move it is a system system,it is a ucarcislike like it's  sistom makes the car move it is oster
3823,this is also a food web but a but it is a a different area looks like in here humans are still the main predators but there are lots of other different,this is also a food with but ibut it is f a different area looks ike n her humans are still the main preters but thelots of lother differen
3824,it is made of plants and animals and humans and trees and living things,i moo of plants and animals and humns and trees and living ting
3825,that's food what eats what,that should wat eat
3826,is made out of uh how many times do you want me to say this it's made out of borough forest tundra and wetland,ua stood a whild pears made of how man imess you want me to stay this is e made out of bear forest tunga and wet lan
3827,systems are what make up the biosphere,cimtoms a what make up the biye is fr
3828,well the subsystems all do something different but when they work together it makes a it makes a full system,well the subsistoms i'll do something different but when they work together it makes  ai
3829,uh we have been doing living systems such as food webs and things like that,h we have been doing living sistom such as food th webs and things like th
3830,different lands like different kind of lands,different land like different kins of land
3831,lands there's desert and forest and wetlands and and and tundra,o to poliions thou desart and w forest in wet lands and and hin ton dr
3832,this is a body system ooh that that's actually kind of cool,this is a body sistom  that's that's axtrakind of col
3833,good,good
3834,these are the different parts of the system,these are the different parts of the sisstome
3835,the oh uh earth is a system,uh oh uh earth is a sistom
3836,the human body is a bunch of different parts put together to be system,the human body is a bunch of fifferent parts put together to be sistom
3837,the body and organs inside it,a the body in the orgonimside it
3838,the arrows point to things that eat each other,the air was point to things that eat each
3839,animals and food chain and all that,animals and food changes and all that
3840,i see mountains trees houses some little barnacles under,i see mountains trees houses some little barnocles under
3841,a system,a csistom
3842,well when i think about length i normally think that like something is a couple feet long luk or like inches long centimeters long s something on that line,we any think about length and only yo think that like something is a coupe of feet long alok or like inches long senimaters longs something on that line
3843,good bye,goodbye
3844,length is like is like from is like how long it is from one place to a whole nother place,length is like is like mis like how long it is from one place to ta whole nother place
3845,it'll tell you like how long it'll take t pre like if you're on a road trip it'll tell ya how long how long it's gonna take to drive to where you want,you'll tell you like how long it'll take t like if you on't a bot ship it'll tell you how long how long it's gong to take to dry ito wheare you want
3846,really good,yea a good
3847,measuring is about like giving an answer on how long or how wide something is or even how tall,measuring is about like getting an answer on how long or how wide something is or even how tall
3848,i would say that it was a hundred centimeters long that it is not short it is like pretty long it's not super small it's pretty big,i s that it is a hundred centimeaters long that iis not shard it is like pon it's not supr small it's pretty big
3849,you're gonna get a different number like you answer's gonna be different like if you use centimeters you're gonna have a different number of centimeters than you're gonna have of inches,you' an i get a different number like yur anceris going to be different like a cending u des you cin ahabitient number of sun meetos than y an have of inches
3850,um you use um centimeters and millimeters for small things instead of large things,um s um send the metols and millio metoles for small things instead of large things
3851,well a meter tape is always a meter long um a meter tape is all about that like pretend you want to measure something it's lke um you it's too,well a ment is always a mear long um a meator tapis all about that like petend you want to measure something it's like um yuit's to
3852,you're always gonna get different size like you're always gonna get different number like sometimes somebody will get four and a half and someone else is gonna get two and a half,you' always ae  get a different size like you' always gan to get a different number like sometimes somedy i get or ant i have but someone else s gn't gett want t hav
3853,one hundred,one hundred
3854,i noticed that um that the door knob is a meter from the ground and uh it's just a meter from the ground it's not any bigger or any shorter it's about a meter,i knows that um the barno was a meate on the ground and u it's a mate om the ground it's not any bigger or any shorter i's about a meeter
3855,a decimeter um is like a millimeter it's like a it's like a s it's like um so it's like a centimeter there are ten decimeters in centimeters,a dest meter um it's like a mlmeor it's like it it's like its it's like um so it's like a cenimeto te ten bes metors an cenimeters
3856,um a measurement standard is when you just use one size only to measure something like inches they're all the same size no matter what centimeters they're all the same size no matter what,um a maiit standyard i's when yeu tust used one scize only to measur something like inchs the all the same scienut no mater wat senmters  the same scize no matter what
3857,it is going really good,it is going rea a good
3858,if you use inches you're gonna have a different amount of inches than you are than centimeters so if you use like inches and centimeters then you can have a different amount of inches than centimeters,if yo use inches aregoing t have a different amount of nches the you are sin cenimters sr if use like inches ind centmeters thean you can have a different amount of inches then cinimeeters
3859,um it's important so um like a like a big distance you wanna use you wanna use a big thing to measure it so so stuff like that is really good,um it's important so um like it like a big distance eu when s ye and heares a big thing to mesur it so so sup like that is really good
3860,i have been studying measurement,i have been studing measurement
3861,well if you use centimeters it's gonna be it's gonna be a lot smaller than it's gonna be with like straws because s most straws are bigger than centimeters,one sanimts is gen ing m it's gong ng be a lot smaller than it s goin to b with like stras becau motruls are bigger hn the cetimutrs
3862,a millimeter relates to a meter because i think it's um larger than it's like ten meters i'm not i think,a mi meter relats to a meetor because i think it's um larger than it's like ten metles on wet i think
3863,well the first time we did it y we used straws and we figured out that everybody's um measurement will be different because the straws were all different sizes,wu s by eat w grals and we foget out that everybody's o mesrment will be different becaus the straws were all different sizes
3864,um you normally use meters when you want to measure something large not small like for example if you wanted measure the height of a whole door you'd use meters instead of centimeters or inches,um you knew is meatle is when you want to measure something large not small like for example of yu and ind measuret the hight of a whole door yu'd use meaters instead of steany meaters or inches
3865,centimeter relates to a meter by because there are a hundred centimeters in a meter so a meter is actually just a hundred centimeters,a cimeter  reli store meater by because there are a hundred centmetors in a meter so a meater is actually just a hundred centimeters
3866,well i observed that it's um different um there's going to be a different length like you're gonna have a different number always no matter what,well i observe that it's um different um there's gong to be a different length like you can't have a different number allways no matter what
3867,you're trying to figure out how long it is or how wide it is,you en vigra how long it is or how wide it is
3868,um well in one centimeter there are ten millimeters,u well in one seiy  ter are ten millon metors
3869,um you can measure things um like with with um with millimeters you're gonna get a more precise answer than with centimeters,um you can measur things on like ith ith um with mila mano sgin agi um more precice answer than with sun meeters
3870,one thousand of them,one thousand of them
3871,uh measurement is when is when you see like how tall something is how wide something is or how long something is,uh measur mant is wheis when you see like how tall something is how wide something is how long something is
3872,well in a wet sponge all you really have to do is put it in the water for a sec and you don't and you don't w and you don't make it soak up all the way,well in o wet sbunge all you really have to do is t put it in the water for the sack and you don't nd you don't and you don't make it sok up all the way
3873,the dry sponge is gonna weigh it's going to weigh the least um the wet sponge the wet sponge is gonna to weigh a little bit more and the soaked sponge is gonna weigh the most,the dry spung is getaway it's get away the least um the wet spunge the wet spung is gotng away a little bit more and the soak spunge es get away the most
3874,um well what you can do is see that like um that th a wet sponge and a dry sponge and a soaked sponge will all weigh different amounts,um whel whay you can do is see that like um that thea wet spun  a dry spunge and ta soak spunge were allway different amounts
3875,the sponge is dry it should be pretty hard and it should be um pretty it should be pretty hard and it and it should be pretty small also,spung is dry it should be pretty hard and it should be um prettty it should be pretty hard and tand it should be pretty small also
3876,we have been um measuring the mass of stuff,wa we have been u measuring the mass of stuff
3877,well the dry sponge or the wet sponge so the the water the water is what makes is what makes the wet sponge heavier so that's why what i just told you works,wel the drye spunge on the wet spung so th the water in the water is what makes is what makes the wet spunge heavier so that's why what i just told you works
3878,you um you use gra you put grams in the other side you put grams in the other side to figure out how heavy the sponge is,you um yused grat you put grams in the other side you put grams on the other side to figure out how heavy the spunges
3879,you don't want to measure too heavy things or else i ca or else you can't put enough grams in one side and you won't and it will be like extra heavy,you don't wa't to measure two heavy things or else i k or else you can't put enough grams on one side and youo and it'll be like exter a heavy
3880,um well you have the dry sponge or the wet sponge so the wet sponge you minus the you minus the grams of the wet sponge and when you minus the grams of the dry sponge to the wet sponge,uhm well you have the dry spend of the wet buncge so the wet spung you mine us the you mine us the grams of the wet spunge i mean ou minus the grams of the dry spunge to the wet spunge
3881,well when i looked through it i figured out that the wet sponge is heavier and it is sixteen grams,oh when it lookd through it ifrigat ouht thought the wet spinderis heavier and it is sixteen grams
3882,well i observed that there is three grams in one cup and then there's the sponge and the li and the two lines match up on the balance so that means that the sponge is three grams,well i observed that there is three grams in one cup and then there's a spunge and the li and the two lion match up on the balence so that means thi spunge is three grams
3883,a soaked sponge will be bigger a lot heavier because it's full with water and yeah,a silk spunge will be bigger a lot happier because it's fill with water and yah
3884,it is going good,it is going good
3885,goodbye,goodbye
3886,um i do what i just did but with a wet sponge,um i do what i just did but with a wet spunch
3887,the dry one will be the least heaviest the wet one will be heavier and bigger and the soaked will be the biggest and the heaviest,the dry one will be the least heaviest the white one will be heavier and bigger and the socktonol be the biggest and the heaviest
3888,um the wet sponge was heavier than the dry sponge,um the west bund is heavier than the dry spunge
3889,we find out that um the dry sponge is not very big um and it doesn't look too heavy,yo find out that um the dry spunt is not very big um and it doesn't look too heavy
3890,um well we used a balance to figure it out and um with grams we would try to even everything out,um we'll we used a ballions to figure it out and um with gram's we wuld try to eaven everything out
3891,well the sponge in the middle would be little less heavier than the soaked cause it won't be soaked all the way and and it'll be big bigger and heavier than the dry,well the spenda a middle would be a little less heavvier than  starks becuse it wodn't be sealked all the way and and it'll be big bigger and heavier than the dry
3892,um uh what is going on is there's this sponge this sponge is heavier than the than the empty cup so so the cup with the sponge is going is um tipping over,um our waygoing on is there's te spunder the spnde is heavier than the than the empty cup so so the cup with the spunge is going is um tipping over
3893,the wa the thing is um the thing in the right cup is a lot heavier than the air,te waby the thing is um the thing and the right cup is a lot heaver than the air
3894,i noticed that the sponge is exactly three grams in this picture,i noticed that the spunge is exactly three grams in this picture
3895,you were trying to figure out how heavy how heavy each object was,you were trying to figure out how heavy how heavy each object was
3896,you can use your balance like to figure out how heavy for example you can figure out how heavy a piece of a cu a gold coin is or money,you can use your ballnts like to figure out how heavy for example yu tha figure out how heavy a piece of a ca gold coin is or money
3897,um well you can measure,um well you can measure
3898,it tells me that um you would just basically um one gram is like half of a gram a kilogram is half of a gram,it tells me that um you would just kep bacicly um one gram is like half of a gra a killy gram is half ofa agram
3899,so um i don't know,so um i don't know
3900,i found out that the shoe was one thousand one hundred grams,i found out that the sho was one thousand one hundred grams
3901,i figured out that the orange was three hundred twenty five grams,i figured out that the orange was three hundred twenty five graans
3902,you couldn't do it because there's not enough gram pieces,you couldn't do it because there's not enough gram pieces
3903,you could um get you could make um one hundred gram gram piece and then you could put that in and see what how it was going then,you could um yet you could make um one hundred gram gram piece and then you could put that in and see what how it was going then
3904,we were seeing like how many gram blocks it took to like weigh a pencil a glue stick a scissors a ruler and a thermometer,we were seing like how many gand blox it took t like way a penc glocic a sisers a ruler and its hermometer
3905,you um so you i can't tell anymore i kind of said it all,you um so you i can't tell anymore i kind ofset at all
3906,one thousand,one thousand
3907,you would use it when there like when it's bigger when something weighs more than one thousand,you would use it when th li when it's bigger when something weis more than one thousand
3908,i noticed that there are five twenties which equal one hundred and then there's gravel on the other side so the gravel must be one hundred grams,i notice that there are five twentis which equaled one hundred and then there's gravil on this other side o the gravil must be one hundred grans
3909,it tells me that the metal disk is eight grams,it tells me that the middal desk is eight graons
3910,grams are the um metric system of weight of weight and mass i think,grns are the metric sistom of weight of weight and mass i think
3911,i observed that there is um i don't see i don't really observe anything,i observe that there is um i don't see you i don't really observe anything
3912,you can f you i don't know,you can y i don't know
3913,you would get a really accurate um answer,you would get a really accurite um answer
3914,um two of the two of the five grams it equals a ten gram and then after you have two ten grams it equals a twenty gram,when you have um five ble little grams then it equals five um one of the five grans and once you have
3915,to use you would need to use the same if you were measuring a pencil you would need to use the same pencil and um and you would need to use grams,tu you would ned to use the same if you are measuring the pencel you wuld need to use the same pencl and um and you uld need to use grayoms
3916,you would you would um d do you would do um like you would measure s you would weigh it with something that's a thousand grams or more,yo w you would mdo you would do m like you would mater syou would wi it with something that's a thousand grans or more
3917,i noticed that that um i don't that maybe that there is ten kilograms in one gram,i noticed that um i d that maybe the there's ten killigrams in one gram
3918,i'm good thank you,i'm good thank you
3919,when you weigh an apple or an orange um you would need a lot more like materials that you can measure and actually get it balanced,when you r an apple or an orange um you would need a lot more like materieale so you caln measure it and actually get it balluncet
3920,the car in the picture weighs seventy grams,the car in the picture was seventy grns
3921,you could use it as a reference because if you had a nickel you could know you can like if you had a lot of nickels you could put em in a cup and then measure it like that,you could use it as reverence because if you had a nickle you could kno you can like if you had a lot of knickles you could put him in a cup and then measure like that
3922,a kilogram is less than a gram you use it when something's less than a gram,a kiigram is less than a gram you use it when somethings less than a gram
3923,um i would describe em that it would go down really far and then it started to go up up up,um i would describe him that it would go down really far and then it started to go up u um
3924,that um in ten minutes it dropped all the way to it dropped a the way to ten,ta um in ten minutes i dropped all the way two i dropp  the way to ten
3925,i discovered that it got much colder,i discoverred that it got much colder
3926,um you can look at it and you know because the starting thermometer is at twenty and the finishing thermometer is at five,um you can look at it and you know because the starting termometer is at twenty and the finishing thermometer is at five
3927,um the temperature is changing,um the temperature is changing
3928,it dropped fifteen celsius,it droppd fifteen secius
3929,and then you would add em together and get your answer of how ma difference it was,and then wou would adthem together and get your answer of how much difference it was
3930,it helps because you can know how it rises in time and how it drops in time,it helps because you can know how it rises in time and how it drops in time
3931,they're about like about i don't know that,they help you the are like about
3932,i displayed it by writing it on a piece of paper and yeah,e jusplayed it by riting it on a piece of paper and yeah
3933,i do not know that question,i dero not knew that question
3934,i drew um my data and numbers on a little piece of paper,i dew um my dada and numbers on a little piece of paper
3935,graphs are to help you um like measure and keep track of your stuff,grass are to help you um like measure and keep trackin your steappf
3936,you can use it to get i don't know,you can use it to get i don't know
3937,they can freeze,they can freeze
3938,it goes up and it gets warmer,it gows up and it gets warmer
3939,it's when it either goes down um the red stuff goes down on a tem thermometer or up,it when aether goes down um the red stuff goes down on a temther monager or up
3940,yeah,i noticed that in ten minutes it dropped down five degrees and then an
3941,it's getting colder and warmer,it's it a colder and warmer
3942,it went down really far and then it's going up,it went down really far and then it's going up
3943,you can count the degrees celsius it dropped,you can count the dgree sacies it dropped
3944,you put numbers on the side,you put numbers on the side
3945,it drops lower,it drops lower
3946,and it dropped really far to only five degrees celsius and it dropped fifteen degrees celsius,and it dropped really far two only five degrees sulcis and it dropped fifteen degrees scacius
3947,you could do twenty degrees celsius minus um whatever how much it dropped on that side equals and then something,you co do twent degrees seci us minos um what ever how much it dropped on that sige equals and then something
3948,i put like how it dropped and how it how it dropped in temperature and how it went up in temperature,i put like how it drobbed im how ithow it dropped in temperature and how it wen  up in tempereature
3949,it helps you keep track of like ten minutes it's five degrees twenty minutes it's thirty degrees like that,it help you kape track of leg ten minutes it's five degrees twenty minutes it's tirty degrees like that
3950,i the parts of the graphed i don't know that,i the parts of the graft i don't know that
3951,it goes down and it's kinda like contracting and so yeah,it gos down and it's kind of like kontracting and soia
3952,e were seeing how much um a water the water temperature would drop when you put ice in it and waited for ten minutes,yo were seing how much um a water water temperature would drop when you put ice in it and waited for ten minutes
3953,you can write it on a piece of paper and yeah,you can wride it on a piece of paper and
3954,for ten minutes,for ten minutes
3955,it's going well thank you,it's going well thank you
3956,you you could add up like you would add up the dropping and like add up how much it dropped and how muched it how much it rised,you you could ad up like you would ad up the dropping and like a op how much it droppbed and how much dit how much it rise
3957,um because if you because you would get a much more accurate answer,um because if he because yu would get a much more accurite answer
3958,i forget,i forget
3959,you would get better because you would just keep practicing and you would get more used to it,you would get better because you would just kep practicying and yould get more used twith
3960,um you measure stuff with meters and that that's basically all of it like you just measure stuff,um you measure stuffed with meetors and bet that's sbacicaly all of it like you just measure stuff
3961,um my the heights of my desk,um my the hights of my desk
3962,um estimating is an educated guess,um estimating is an egicated guess
3963,it would it's kind of good cause then you kind of have like something that will help you when you're like estimating,i word it's kind of good cause then you kind of have like something that will help you when youre like estimating
3964,estimating's all about um like if you don't have a ruler or something then it can help you because you would have a pretty good like guess,estimatings all about um like if you don't have a ruler something then can help you because you would have a pretty good like guess
3965,um from the ground to the doorknob,um from the ground to the doornob
3966,they all have centimeters in em,they all have cenmeters in a
3967,in math we've been doing multiplication and division,in matth we've ben doing multiblacation and devision
3968,it is three units,it is three units
3969,you would estimate because you would estimate,you would estomit because you would estimit
3970,um because like m in like i forget,um because like mns like i forget
3971,you can keep practicing and then your estimates will get better and better,you can keep practicing and then you're estimits will get better and better
3972,good how are you i'm very good how are you,ut how are you i'm very good how are you
3973,it stands for the campacity of the can,it stands for the campassity of the can
3974,i do not know that,i do not know that
3975,we u the metric system uses milliliters and right now in school we only used milliliters,wi you the mattic sistom uses mill leaters and rigte now in school we only use mello leaters
3976,you could use water to help figure out the campacity of a can,you could use water to help figure at the cmpasity of a can
3977,that is the campacity of the soda can,that is the canpassity of the sotakam
3978,i discovered that it was i didn't really discover anything,i discovered that it was idoldn't really discovere anything
3979,they compare because they're usually prewedy by to each other so that you can actually get so i don't know yeah,they can pear because they're usualy pri close to each other so that you can actually get so i don't know dea
3980,is doing a math equation to get you to your answer,is doing a mathaquasion to get you to your answer
3981,you measure how much um liquid is in something,you meatter how much um liquid is in something
3982,there's a syringe a graduated cylinder and a liter a liter like cup thing,there's a srand ah grauated ti linder and a leader a leader like cup thing
3983,i noticed that the liquid isn't all the way to the top,i noticed that the liquid isn't all the way to the top
3984,when we worked with the soda can we were seeing if uh the number on the bottle was um campacity or volume,when we worked with the soata cane were sing if  the number on the battle was m capascity or volume
3985,i observed that the campacity of the orange soda can is three hundred thirty three milliliters,i observe that the campassity of the ornge sodctan is three hundred thirty three miloiters
3986,i do not know that,i do not know that
3987,um a graduated cylinder and put water in it and then dump it into the the into the soda can,um a grattuated silunder and put water in it and then dump it into the the into the coata can
3988,you you would add fifty and fifty and that would get you to one hundred,y you would add fifty and fifty and that would get you tw one hundred
3989,the printed number tells you how much soda is in the can or whatever liquid is in the can,the printid number tells you how much sota is in the can or whatever liquid is in the can
3990,that it would have to be full to be volume and full all the way to the top to be be volume and campacity,thet it would have to be full to be volume and full all the way to the top to be be vollume and cantassit
3991,i observed that it's at its capacity and its capacity is three hun three hundred thirty three milliliters,i observe that it's a its campasity and its campasity is three hund three hundred thirty three miloleaders
3992,in math we saw we tried to see if,and matth we saught we tried to see if
3993,i'm well,i well
3994,i do not know,i do not know
3995,campacity is the is the is the thin is the amount of something in something when it's filled all the way to the top,capassity is the is the s the thing is the amount of something in something when it's filled all the way to thetop
3996,so that you can know you got the right answer,so that you can know yougot the reight answer
3997,you would use a syringe or a graduated cylinder and with the syringe you would pull the liquid out and with the graduated cylinder you would pour the stuff in it and yeah,you would use a sin or gradty waited cilunder and with the curganc ye would pull the lo liquid out and wth the gratuated cilunder you would pu the stuff in it and ma
3998,i observed that the three hundred milliliters is the volume of the liquid and three hundred thirty three is the campacity of the liquid,i observe that the three hundred milleators is a vollume of he liquid and three hundred thirty three is the kempasity of the liquid
3999,i observed that the tall container holds two hundred milliliters of water,i observe that the tall container holds two hundred melo leders of water
4000,th i don't know,i don't know
4001,you could look at the container and see how big it is and then look at the syringe and see how big it is and then think how many of the syringes will go in to it,you could look at the intaner and see how big it it is and then look at this range and see how big it is and then think how many of the carrangees will go into it
4002,we figured out the volume by using a syringe and um a graduated cylinder o,we figured out the vollume by using a srin and m a grattuated cilender
4003,you can you ha can find an object that you know how much water it holds and then use that to measure the volume of something,you can you can find an object that you know how much water it holds and then yuse that to measure the volume of something
4004,you measure something things that are smaller than a liter s b yeah,you measures something things that are smaller than a leter  ye
4005,that object is a syringe and it has forty milliliters of water,that object is a sorange and it has forty milon leaters of water
4006,i realized that the cup was filled with one hundred forty two milliliters,i realized that the cup was filled with one hundred forty two mirs
4007,syringe we used um could go up to you could get it up to fifty and then it would stop so yeah,certused um could go up toiyou could get it up to fifty and then it would stop so ye
4008,it's when you it can't hold anymore water,it's when you it can't hold anymore water
4009,they're all two hundred milliliter vessels,the're all two hundred milier vessils
4010,volume is um the stuff volume is what is inside of a um of a um of a container or something,volume is um the stuffvolume is what is in side of a um of a container or something
4011,i notice that it has one hundred milliliters it can hold one hundred milliliters,i notice that it has one hundred millleaters it cant hold one hundred mlle leaders
4012,capacity is um amount it can hold when it's to the tippy tip top like yeah,timpassity is the amount it can hold when it's to the tippy tip top like yeah
4013,it's going well thank you,it's going well thank you
4014,i discovered that different containers hold different um amount and if you have a bigger container you have a bigger answer and you have if you have a smaller container you have a smaller answer,i discover that differentcontainers hold different um amount and if you have a bigger container you have a bigger anwer and you h if you have a smaller contner you have a smaller answer
4015,yesterday we saw how much a plastic cup how many um how many milliliters a plastic cup had um like we used yeah,yesterday we saw how much a plastic  how many um how many millo leaters a plastic up had um like and we used yeah
4016,i noticed that um at the cup's capacity it had one hundred forty two milliliters in it,i noticed that um at the cups kinpassity it had one hundred forty two midl leaters in it
4017,i do not know,i do not know
4018,i don't know,all of
4019,that tool is a graduated cylinder,that tule is a gratuated cilender
4020,i learned that it doesn't really matter what shape it is if it holds the same amount of water,i learn that it doesn't really matter what shape it is if it holds the same amount of water
4021,you would measure things that are smaller than a liter and that are bigger than one milliliter,you would masure things that are smaller than  leader and that are bigger than one midlo leader
4022,when you have an empty cup you can use it for um putting in in the balance or basically anything,wen you have an empty cup you can use it forver um putting in in the ballenc or baciccleat anything
4023,it makes them good cause you can suck up a prec very precise amount of water,it makes em good cause you can suck up a persovery percice amount of water
4024,you can use a vial,you can use a vil
4025,these tools are useful because you can go from so you can i don't really know,these tles are ouseful because you can go from so you can i don't really know
4026,um they i don't know what they represent,um they i don't know what they reppresent
4027,it's a liter,it's a leer
4028,good,good
4029,it would tell you how big or small the cup is,it would tell you how big or small the cuppis
4030,i noticed that the first vial is much bigger than the second vial,i noticed that at the first file is much bigger than the second file
4031,a liter can be broken down into milliliters,e leater can be broken down into millo leaters
4032,um we used um vials b and i don't really know,um we used um viles be and i don't really know
4033,you would um there's numbers on the side and you would see how many mmm um some i don't know,you would um there's numbers on the side and you would see how many smi don't know
4034,the plastic cup,the plastic cup
4035,i noticed that both of the cups have um mmm one hundred milliliters on them,i noticed that both of the cups have um one hundred millo leaders on them
4036,you wouldn't get a very good an answer because they're different size and it's not a very good way to measure liquid,you wouldn't get a very good al answer because the're different size and it's not a very good way to measure liquid
4037,you would fill the cup with water and then you would ta you take a,you would fill the cup with water and then you would tae you take a
4038,i don't know what the metric units are for measuring volume,i don't know what the me tricunuts are for measuring volume
4039,it's a syringe with um water in it,it's a cen with um water in it
4040,i do not know that,i do knot know that
4041,ten of them make up a liter,ten of them make a e leader
4042,ere are one thousand one thousand milliliters in a liter,are one thosand one thousand mia leaders in a leader
4043,there are one thousand milliliters in a liter,there are one thousand m leders in a leaer
4044,s telling me that you milliliters are less than a liter,stelling me that you milaters are less than a leader
4045,i forget,i forget
4046,milliliters are less than a liter so that you can um measure the volume of something less than a liter,milators are less than a leador sho that you can mesur the volume of something less than a leater
4047,you would need to um weigh them and like weigh them and then put them on on and then put them in order from heaviest to lightest,would need to um and wa them and like wetem and then put them on on and then put them inn order from heaviest to lightest
4048,it's that the like gray line a adds up with the like elevated blue space,it's that the like gray line a as up with the like ellevated blue space
4049,that picture is of a little is of a cube that is one gram,that picture is of a little is of a kute that is wotn gram
4050,i forget and i don't know,i forget and i don't know
4051,the they're the they put the um metal chip in one side of the um scale and then they're putting grams in to see how much it weighs,theytherthe they put the u middle thrip in one side of the umscale and then they're putting gramsin to see how much it waves
4052,because then you'll get a much more accurate answer than with your hands,because then you'll get a much more accurite answer than with your hands
4053,you could do it by if you if you were just estimating you could like i what i wrote is i thought the heaviest was the um metal and then the plastic and then the wood,you could do it by if y if you were just estimating you could like hi what i ra is i thought the heaviest was the um meddle and then the plastic and then the wood
4054,it's that um the materials weigh more and that when some materials weigh more than other materials,it's that um the materals waight more and s that went some materials way more than other materals
4055,um you are using a scale to measure to measure the weight of the plastic disk,um you are using a scail to measure to measure the weight of the plastic desk
4056,the um,se um
4057,you would measure the weights of things,you would measure the weaights of things
4058,i don't know,don't know
4059,you would need to,you and na
4060,i for i don't know,i fer i don't know
4061,we used paper clips,we used paper clips
4062,it would affect because i don't know,it would effect because i don't know
4063,um it was one gram,m it was one gran
4064,i don't know,i don't know
4065,it was eight grams the little the metal disk was eight grams,it was ate grams the little the medl desk was aht gran
4066,i do not know,i do not know
4067,um grams are um what like the metric sy grams are the metric system are in the metric system,m grams are m what like the meticgrans are the metic sistom arin the metic cistom
4068,then we used grams to actu to figure out the real answer,sudnaly used gram's to actal to figure at the real answer
4069,the weight and the mass is that it is eight grams,the wih and the mass is that it is eight grams
4070,it's not a good technique because um miss our teacher gave us two different kinds of paper clips so we all we got different answers,a good tucnin because um in us our teacher gave us two different kinds of paper clip so we all we got different answers
4071,paper clips,paper clips
4072,i think it's the material that makes them different amounts,i think it's the material that makes some different amountais
4073,you uh i don't know i think,you i don't mi think
4074,it means that it is eight grams,it means started is at gran
4075,i discovered that our paper clips weighed one gram,i discovered that our paper clips waihed one gram
4076,i forget,i forget
4077,on c the temperature is twenty degrees,an see the temperature is twenty degrees
4078,it works better because then you get the accurate the correct answer and yeah,it works better because then you get the accurate te corect answer andy
4079,you use a thermometer to measure the temperature of something,you usas ther momedur t measure the temperature of something
4080,i do not know,i do not know
4081,it measures,something
4082,um there is no more i can say,um there is no more i can say
4083,i do not know that,i do ot know that
4084,i think he is trying to figure out w um which one is hottest which one is coldest and which one is in between,i think he's trying to figure out um which one is hottest which one is coldest and which on is in between
4085,yesterday we used our fingers to see um if cup a cup b or cup c's w water was warmer,yesterday we used our fingers to see um if cup a cup earcup ce water was warmer
4086,so that everybody can know like have a standard thing for like room temperature and like when you don't go outside and stuff like that,so that everybody can know like have a standere thing for the grom temperature like when you don't go out side and stuff like that
4087,we estimated with our finger,we estimated with our finger
4088,you can sense the different temperatures of the water,you can cent the different temperatures of the water
4089,um i do not know,um i do not know
4090,good,good
4091,i do not know that,i do not know that
4092,it tells you that it's much much colder,it tells you that it's much much colder
4093,we used a thermometer to see the temperature in the water,we used a termometer to see the temperature in the water
4094,i think about is it hot cold or just warm,i think about is it hot cold or just warm
4095,so that you can all know the exact temperature of the water and nobody will get confused in between which one is warmer and which one is colder,so that you can all know the exact temperature of the water and nobody will get confused an between which one is warmer and which one is colder
4096,we were seeing ha which cup was warmer and we figured out that the b cup was the coldest but a and c were the same temperature,we were seing a hat which cup was warmer and we figured out that the bea cup was the coldest but eay and se were the same temperture
4097,it's when it's hot when it goes up and it's cold when it's go dow when it goes down,it when it's hart when it gos up and it's cold when it's go down  when it goes down
4098,you u we're using celsius in this unit,you you were using scalciuss in this unet
4099,um we we i found out that the it went in between fifty and ten which is thirty and yeah,um we v i found out that the i one en between fifty and ten which is thirty and yeh
4100,we're mixing the ice and the co and the hot water together and we're gonna get a new temperature of water,were mixing the ice and the col in the hot water together and were goning get a new tema ture of water
4101,we put a thermometer in,we put as a mamiter in
4102,you use grams,you use grams
4103,i found out that the dry sponge was three grams and that but that it was three grams,i found out that the dry spun was thee grams and that whatbat it was thr gn
4104,i forget and i don't know,i forget and i don't know
4105,a soaked sponge um i don't know,ah silk spend um i don't know
4106,i know that if you um put a dry sponge in water that it will like z absorb and get much bigger,i know that if you um put i a dry spunge in water that it will ab absorb and get much bigger
4107,um the s i observed that the sponge the dry sponge soaked up um thirteen grams of water,um this i abserved that the spun the drye spunge soaked ub um tirten grams of water
4108,um i don't really know anymore,um i don't really know anymore
4109,the sponge in the middle is wet and it doesn't have as much water in it as the soaked sponge,the spunge in the middle is wet and it doesn't have as much water in it as the soat sunc
4110,i noticed that the dry sponge equals three grams,i no just that the dry spen equoe three grams
4111,you um when you don't you would count you count the grams and the cup without the sponge in it,you um when you don' you would cu you count the grams in the cup without the spentnit
4112,i noticed that um that they were balanced and the white thing was in line with the blue um line,i noticed that um that they were ballanced and the white fing was in line with the blue u vine
4113,you can see how much water the sponge soaked up by um doing the answer you got minus the weight of the dry sponge,you can see how much water the spunge soked up by um doing the answer you got minest the wight of the dry spunge
4114,it's going good thank you,it's goo good thank you
4115,we were trying to figure out how much they weighed,we were trying to figure out how much they wied
4116,so these objects there's a dry sponge a wet s sponge and a soaked sponge and the dry sponge is the lightest then the wet sponge then the soaked sponge is the heaviest,so these objects there's a dry spung owet s spunge an a siak spung and the dry spung is the lightest then the wet spung then the siak punge is the heaviest
4117,um a wet sponge is um soft is squishier and um it feels softer and yeah,um a wet spund is um soft is squusstier and um it feels softer and yeah
4118,when you have a balance and a sponge you can um put the sponge in one side and put gram pieces on the other side to see how much it weighs,when you have a bolence on a spunge you can um put the spungin oneside and put gram pieces on the other side to see how much it weies
4119,i found out that the dry sponge when it when it's soaked absorbed like um like ten times its own weight,i found out that the dr spens when it went to soaped absorbed like am like ten times its own wight
4120,it's when it stops absorbing water,it's when it stops absorbing water
4121,you can use a balance to measure the weight and the mass of something,you can use the ballence to madsure the weight and the mass of something
4122,i figured out that the wet sponge was sixteen grams,i figured out that the wet spunge was sixteen grams
4123,i do not know,i do not know
4124,i forget,i forget
4125,t,d
4126,you would need to think about how long is your hand or your finger and then you can measure it,you would need t think about how long is your hand or your finger and then you can masure it
4127,you would use centimeters,you would use senimators
4128,it tells you that it's one centimeter wide,it tells you that it's once on a meeter wide
4129,you use millimeters when something is smaller than a centimeter,you' use melmeters when something is smaller than a sent meater
4130,and generally usually um two things are like the same heighth,in genral usually um two things are like the same hith
4131,that the biggest like thing with centimeters on it is a meter then it goes to the decameter then a centimeter then a me millimeter,that the biggest like thing wit sentimeters on it is a metor then he gos to a decmter then a senameter thenammet mil meter
4132,i see that her nose and her ear are the same length,i see that her nose in her eair art the same length
4133,to check your answer so you can make sure you got it right,to check your answer so you can make sure you got it right
4134,centimeters,senmeters
4135,because um a meter stick is more is like you can have a more accurate answer than if you used your hand,because um a metor stick is more is like you can have a more accurite answer than if you used your hand
4136,um it's a i for i don't know,um it's all i fer i don't know
4137,i forget,i forget
4138,i measured my foot and the distance around my wrist i think it was cool because it w um because i it was just very cool,i measured my foot and the distance around my rist i think it was cool because it w um because i it was just very col
4139,but my arm span and my heighth,the my airnspand and my heighth
4140,i measured from my wrist to my elbow,i measured from my rist to my elbow
4141,i don't know,i don't know
4142,you use a ruler or a meter stick or like something like that,you use a ruler or a metor stick or like something like that
4143,you would um have to measure it so you would get the right answer and be sure you know how like tall you are like measuring the heighth,you would um have to measure it i you would get the rid answer and be sure you know how like all you are sensewere him like masuring the hight
4144,you wou you could still use a meter stick but you would use the centimeters on it,you woul you could still use the meeter stick but you would use the scinmeters on it
4145,you have to begin at a corner and end at a kind of corner otherwise you won't really have a quite accurate measurement,you have to be gin at a corner and end at a conn corner otherwise you won't really have a quite acurate measurment
4146,i forget i think,i forget i think
4147,when i figured out how long no tall my ear was it was really cool because it was the same length as my nose,when i figured out how long nop tall my ear was it was really cool because it was the same ling as my nose
4148,i don't know,i don't know
4149,the person is measuring his pinkie and finding out that it is one centimeter wide,the person is measuring his pinkey and finding out that it is one centametor wide
4150,you use centimeters to measure when something's not as long as a meter so you can find the right answer,o use centimators to measure when somethings not as long as a meter so you can find the right answer
4151,l it fits in because if you know how wide your pinkie is then you can tell like objects with your pinkie so you know how um wide or tall they are,if itsn't because if you know how wide er pinky is then you can coun't like objects with your pinkees so you'd know how um wid or tall they are
4152,you would use em when there's for the millimeters you wouldn't use it when it then when it's smaller than a centimeter and you would use centimeters when it's smaller than a decameter,ye would use them whn there sfer the miller mters he would nt use it when then when it smaller than as sentimetor and he would reuse etametors when it smaller than a deck meter
4153,um i don't know,i don't know
4154,um you would you measured it twice because if you're like meter if you had a me meter measuring um tape then it will kind of go like,like it would just go fat it would be very rinkly so you couldn't really get a quite percice answer
4155,yeah,yeah
4156,you could use a ruler and then like every rule most rulers are the same size so you would get a more accurate answer,yo could use  ruler and then like every rule most rulers are the same size so you would get a more accurate answer
4157,it was about um to see how um how long it how wide it was and how long it was,it was about um to see how um mhow long it how whye it wasn't how long it was
4158,lot of sense,lie sence
4159,length is like about like the um i'm i forget what length's all about,ling is like about like the um i i forget ling all about m
4160,i don't know,i don't know
4161,measuring is about um like measuring is i don't know what measuring is about,measuring is about um like mesuring is i don't know what masuring is about
4162,yes,yes
4163,it worked,it worked
4164,hi my name is nicky and i'm nine,hy my name is nickey and i'me nine
4165,you got uh a much different answer so it would be a really bad um strategy to use straws,you got a much different answerr so it would be a really bad um stratigy to use jraws
4166,hi,iy
4167,it isn't a real good um strategy because um there's a lot of different sized straws in the world so it's really not a good strategy,t isn't a real good m stratigy because um there's a lot of different size traws in the wrld so it's really not a good stratigy
4168,marty i have to go,mrady i have to go
4169,yeah,yeeah
4170,uh when you use group a's and for the width it only take four straws and when you use group b's straws it takes um i think twelve,u when you used grup egs and fur the with it only takes forestraws and when you use grup beasstraws it hags um i think twelve
4171,i used a straw and then i used um a measuring tape with um centimeters on it,i used a straw and then i used am a measuring tape with um catmeters on it
4172,yes,yes
4173,i would be trying to figure out how long that is the thing you asked me to measure is,i would be trying to figure out how long that is the thing you ask me to measure is
4174,because it's like a meter or something thing,because it's like a meter something  is
4175,a yard stick,a yard stick
4176,um we then we read a book it was about how we think feet got to be,um we then we read a book it was about how we think fe got to be
4177,yeah i did learn uh we had like this long thing with meter,yeh i didn't learn him u we had like thi long thing with meter
4178,no we just uh the straws were just uneven,no whightes of the sries were just un eaven
4179,um we imagined pictures like it a light would be like a l kilometer um we imagined things that might be a kilometer,um we imaginnd pictures like if a light would be like a lot callibitor um we imagineing that might be a callieutor
4180,uh mile is very long it's very big um would probably be about half a mile,myle is very long t's very bigyouro would probably be about half mile
4181,thousand a thousand wait um a hundred,southen a souven ight um  hundred
4182,right there uh huh,right there isn't i n ors eo
4183,that means you would start using feet um or centimeters or any other,that may do start er tin cheets u or ten meters
4184,well i learned that um part of it is a centimeter,well i learne that um part of it is a centimetor
4185,like there would be one straw that was this long and then another straw that was this long,like ther i be one straw that i was this long then another strats this long
4186,um the least amount would be a meter,um the least amount wold be a meter
4187,it has a thousand in a millimeter i mean wait a millimeter there's a thousand m um millimeters in a meter,and of the thousand and a milter it's the milimeter re thousand um ni meters in a meeter
4188,um they're centimeters and they're very small they are like the length of a bug um they're but there is something smaller than a centimeter,um theyre eimeaters and theyre very small theyre like the legs of bug um there but there is somethings maler than a centimater
4189,but my desk is like way back there so,but my desh ould like pa back there the i' all ret aminat sks
4190,um no,togh
4191,um he's three feet long,um he' three feet long awa
4192,um because straws are uneven and a meter is a um a good way because it's even it's always even,um because strother and even animeter is  u a good way because it's even it's always even
4193,thousand,fate
4194,um you could measure a bug,um you can measure a burg
4195,hi,high
4196,yeah cause we learned that,ye cause he learned that
4197,a y a yard stick a meter,aa yard stick a neter
4198,well we would use them so that if you hike you would know how far you would need to go or how long you have hiked,well we would yuse them so that if you hike you would know how far you need to go or how long you have hight
4199,uh the tip of a pencil um how skin skinny a pencil is,u the tip of a pencl tuhat' i'l skin skin of pencilis
4200,you would,you a
4201,um a hundred,a hm a hundred
4202,it is a millimeter,it is a mello meter
4203,but they could be uneven straws,but they could be un eaven straws
4204,well when we we kinda like felt it and we i think it was like the same except yeah,well when we  kind of like ellt wae i think it was like the same he sipt yah
4205,um grams wa and water oh yeah li yeah,greeam's water and water yeh
4206,um we used the metric system,u we you have the mettric sistom
4207,spongebob squarepants,ojs eans
4208,hi,hi
4209,then it went like that and then it kinda went up,then it rnt lict and then a kind of went up
4210,well um when you actually measured them we found out that we were right oh,well when you actually measured them we undout that we were right u
4211,or the weight or,or the waight or

4216,yeah,tear
4217,yeah,yeah
4218,um that's a thermometer and i'm guessing it uses celsius,um tet's a thimometers and ijesing  you te selthiest
4219,well i know that we now we i know we that in u s a we don't use it um,well i know that we nowi know that in the afay we don't use at um
4220,well actually they were saying um a and c were the same and then b was cold,what dod they ar saying um a and sebar  sae then bee was cold
4221,um i think so,um i think though
4222,well we thought that it was re we thought it was warm and then we got really cold really cold then it just started to warm up,well we thought that it was real wtha thought it was warm and i ut got really cold nd wat cold and started warm up
4223,hello hi,hellow high
4224,um it freezes,um itf freses
4225,um kinda,um kalinda
4226,yeah,yeah
4227,um a balance,um a ballence
4228,not really,i reallyes
4229,well we ended it,wwe end id it
4230,yeah i'd like to,yeh i like to
4231,um i've liked how we got to d use the thermometer the first one to use it,um i'v liked how we got to t uses ther mometeor ise like the firce one to use it
4232,well yeah um the important thing about that is if you don't use the same you don't get an accurate thing,well ye um ha porn't thing about that i i you don't used the same you don't get n ackorat sying
4233,it burn boiled,it broils
4234,yep,ria
4235,yeah,yeah
4236,um he's using his finger mmm hmm,well he's yeasing his fingerm
4237,yeah,ya
4238,yeah like cold,yello cames  cold
4239,um weighing the apples,um wing the apples
4240,what,a
4241,you would put the container of water in one and then in the other one you'd put how many grams or if y what measurement you're using,you would put the tinor of water in one and then in the other one you ould put n any graon theif ywhat measurmint you'r yeter
4242,um grams,um fraans
4243,um we had like little bags and we put sand in there so we ha each group had each team had two bags and then we put them into a giant bag and,um we had like little bags and we put the and in there so wea each group hat each teem had two bags and then we put them into a giant baggin
4244,um oh grams,creaons
4245,we knew it,ar the we net
4246,well hmm,wll
4247,yes we know that um it's a wet sponge because of the size that would mean that this much grams equals a wet sponge,yes we know that um it's a wet spunge because of the flies that would mean that this much grams equals a wet un
4248,well this i we know that's that's a wet s sponge from let's see where is that picture,well lifi we know thats that's a wets spunge from se where is that pecture
4249,uh hi cool,i cu w
4250,um we did measurement today um,um we did measure int today um
4251,n mmm,mm
4252,um so what we did first was we got like everything we need and like the balance and the mass pieces um mass pieces,um so what we did first was we got like everything we need like the ballu and the mass piecers um mass pieces
4253,grams eighty three grams,gryams ager gram
4254,um it's about h how much you think it is the closest you think it will be,uum it's about how much you think it is the closest you think it will be
4255,yes before we me um estimated the weight of the sponge um the dry sponge we estimated,yes before we met um estimated the wiht of the spunge um the drs spuns e estimated
4256,yeah we knew that the spon the dry sponge was two grams so we minus two grams from eighty five and we got eighty three,ye we knew that the splnd the dry spunge wath twograms so ie min as two grams from eighty five and g eighty three
4257,oh i don't really remember,oh i don't know y remember
4258,well we knew it i know it's not a kilometer cause that's in me like um,well e knew it i knowi  a killa meater cause that's admit like ha um
4259,yeah gram gram piece like,ye gram gram pece like
4260,yup,yup
4261,um well we our teacher um did that but i think it's still drying out think so,um well weour teacher um do that but i think i's ti drying out t six
4262,we did um weighing how much sponge ca e um water can take up,we ded um wying how much spunge c  um water can take up
4263,dry sponge,dry spunc
4264,um a kilogram,um a tllogram
4265,good,good
4266,um sometimes but usually not really,m sometimes but usually not really
4267,um i haven't learned that yet hmm i think that was it,m i haven't larned that yet i think t s it
4268,wa water,wwater
4269,we weren't here,we weren't heare
4270,um this side,um this side
4271,the more i'm guessing the more water it has the bigger it is,the more un gessing the more water it havs the ier it is
4272,i don't know,i don't know
4273,um it was squishy we didn't really feel it though yeah i didn't really feel,om mo s quisty we didn' realy feel tuh yet i didn't relly feel
4274,um well when put it in the water we saw it like a giant but when you took it out it was smaller,um well when we put it in the water we saw it like a giant but when yo took it out was somall heire
4275,yeah,
4276,what,what
4277,i haven't done that i don't know yet,i ven't lown that i don't know yet
4278,um it's keeping all the water in there until you can squeeze it out,uhm it's keeping all the water and there until you cant squeeze an our
4279,what,what
4280,so that in case you accidentally dropped it you it wouldn't be good m explosion,so that in case you acellin dropped it you it wouldn't make a explosion
4281,bye,a
4282,um stan a standard unit when you use liquids would be water or like the kinda liquid that you're using,um tant a stander yun't when you use liquids would be water or like the kind of licqua yeat you're using
4283,the vile,the viole
4284,yeah like you could like um use like take the smaller and put it somewhere else and like take turns using it,yea like you could like um you lk tacke the smaller and put it  someere else innecke take turms using it
4285,i think this one is,i think that's one if
4286,like pour it and then see how many milliliters it is,like port and then see how manm mil later thed
4287,well because it's higher and it kinda looks like like it was then and it like it looks like then and like looks the same,well because it's higher and a kind ok like like ter's tan an yok it looksy la looks looks the same
4288,of something it's like a k like a think like that looks like kinda like this,o something's like olike a thing like that looks like kind like thiss
4289,well,
4290,and this these two things,and this these two things
4291,well you look at it and like go like this with your hands and then like,well you think look at it and like golike this with your hands and un like
4292,guess what um estimating would be,guess  um estimating would be
4293,no,no
4294,estimates are basically about guessing,as te mids are al a base glu about guessing
4295,uh well you could do the cup and like could have,a well you could do the cup and like ha cat
4296,i know,i no
4297,because if you don't want the same one you're not accurate,because if you don't want the same one yu' not accrit
4298,uh no we didn't it was not um we didn't do it with f we didn't it wasn't full we just poured water and was like empty,uh no we didn' it was not um we didn't do it wat e didn't it wasn't full b disuppored waterrth like ty
4299,um we fi we figured out we went like this and this and then we did all of it well we went to a and then class b like went like we would take the thing and pour in more and more,um we fiwe figured it out we went like this than this then we did all vitwell we went to a in class beat like wint like we would take the thing and pore and more and more
4300,well uh well milliliters are um a liter is i think a thousand milliliters and milliliters are li like a drop,well ah well milaters are um a leater  i think a thousand milaters and ilater ter live like a drop
4301,um you could use um this,um you could yus um this
4302,um i don't know,um i don't know
4303,um well we figured out that it we that the soda company the um people who made these w w left a little space because um because uh,um well we figured out that it wa tha sota company the um people who made these w left a little space because um because e
4304,i think graduated cylinder,i think graguited s under
4305,well then you know that it's well then if you pour and it gets all the way up there and then you still have extra you could pour it into a one liter beaker and then pour the rest into here,wel then you know that it's well then if you poretit and gets all theway up there and then you stall v extra you can pr it into a on leter beakar and then por the rest om te hear
4306,um es measure stuff smaller than a liter,um as measure stuff smaller than a leaser
4307,yeah,yeh
4308,you could like,you could like
4309,well like for the one the graduated cylinder measure the volume you could like pour like this cup into there and see how much it is,well like for them when the grattuated sil under t measur the vollume you could like pore like this cup into theire and see how much it t is
4310,um you would probably think twice of how much it would be,um you could probably think it twice of how much it would be
4311,um that they were like we weren't accurate and we weren't using a good amount,um that they were like we wern't accourit and we aren't you think a good amount
4312,water milliliters liters um,water milliers leaer s
4313,yeah and then like see if it goes like to the fifty or um twenty line and then you would know that it had like a hundred and twenty,yeah and then like see figgle ik ti the fifty or um twenty nine d then you know that lk a hundred and twenty
4314,hello,heow
4315,estimate,estimat
4316,hi h hi bye,i ha f
4317,well you could you like pole that's kinda like this and,what you could use a long like pull that's kind like this and
4318,um it was k um meters,um it was  um meeters
4319,thank you,ankyo
4320,it's all about one gram one gram equals just about one t p tiny particle of each tw thing we have here,sll about one gram one gram equals just about one pete tiny particle of each tthing we have here
4321,we measured them and find out how heavy they were and it was pretty cool,we measured them and find out how heavy thit were and it was pretty cool
4322,the things are being put inside the bask int the things are being put inside the scale,the th things are being put inside the bathin the thngs are being put inside the scale
4323,we could put it on a scale,we culd put it on a scale
4324,the one on the right is heavier,the one on the right is heavier
4325,to find out how heavy the metal disc is,to find out how heavy the medtal disk is
4326,i could use them to put the things on the scale and see how much they weigh,i could use them to put the things on the scale and see how much they wa
4327,good,good
4328,we've been practicing measurement,we've been practicing measurement
4329,to see what material they're made of and then we'd be able to find out how heavy they would be,to see what material theyre made of and then would be able to find out how heavy they would be
4330,their mass is heavier so they weigh more,the'r mais heavier so they weaghd more
4331,y we're trying to see how many paper clips will fit into each cup into the cups to make it equal to the plastic chip,w were trying to see how many paper clips will fit into each cup into the cup to make it equal to the plastic ship
4332,paper clip is not equal to one gram one gram is a lot lighter than a large paper clip because a paper clip et weigh a large paper clip weighs more than one gram,paper clip is not equal to one gram one gram is a lot lighter than a large paper clip because a paper clip eat waiht a large paper clip wavs more than one gram
4333,bye,by
4334,a scale,ascale
4335,to see how much they both weigh,to see how much they both wet
4336,weighing the plastic disc was all about about seeing how many grams it was and wha and how mu how heavy it would equal,weaying the plastic tist was all about about seing how many grams it was and wa and how how heavy it would equal
4337,the weight is heavier and so it is just a lot easier to use,the weight is heavier and so it is just a lot easier to use
4338,it will help you know the exact si the exact way about it and it's very important,will help you know the exact  the exact way about it and it's very important
4339,is figuring out how heavy it is to make sure they are correct,is figuring out how heavy it is to make sure they are coracked
4340,they all are made of different me materials so they make different so they weigh different things,they all are made of different mmaterials so they make different so they weayg different things
4341,yes,s
4342,metal is heavier than plastic and wood so that makes it heavier,meddle is happier than plastic in wood so that makes it heavier
4343,i put the things in the buckets to see how heavy they were,i put the things in the buckets to see how heavy they are
4344,use a scale,o use a scale
4345,see there's eight grams in this cup so the cup is this metal disc is equal to eight grams that's how you can figure it out,see there's eight crams in this cup so the cup is this medtal disk is eal to eat grams that's how you can figure it out
4346,it's important to get the accurate measurements unless y if you want to get if you want to know how e much something weighs n to get if you're going to buy something,it's important to et the accurat measurments unless you if you want to get if you want to know how  how much something ways t g if you a're going to bite something
4347,i think this is happening because it is representing the electricity,i think this is happening because it is representing the electriscity
4348,it is important because if if one light bulb dies then the other stays,it is important because if if one lighe bull dies han the other stays
4349,no it is not different,no it is not different
4350,the pathways don't only go through the metal part of the light bulb but they also go through the fuse of the light bulb,the pathways don't only go through the middale part of the light bal but they also go through the fus of the lighe bol
4351,a series circuit is an electrical circuit with only one pathway a parallel circuit is an electrical circuit with two more than one pathway,a cery circuete is an electrical circuet with only one pathway a parele circet is a electrical circut with t more than one pathway
4352,that is representing the electricity flowing through the light bulbs,that is representing the electricity flowing through the life bobs
4353,they are different from series circuits because they would have more than one pathway and series circuits only have one pathway,they are different from cery circuts because they would have more than one pathway and cerye circuts only have one pathway
4354,yes i did,yus i did
4355,we've been learing about series and parallel circuits,we've bee learning about series and parelel curcuts
4356,the electricity is flowing from the battery to one light bulb and through that light bulb it is it is flowing through more wires to another light bulb,the electrisity is flowing from the battery to one lipbolb and through that lipbolb it is it is flowing through more wires to another lpbold
4357,good,good
4358,they flow through the r they flow through the metal and the light bulb holders,and they flew through the rthey flew through the meddale on the lihe olb holders
4359,it is a parallel circuit because there are two pathways,it is a parlo circout because there are two pathways
4360,there are two pathways from the li from the battery that are going to the two different light bulbs,there are two pathways from the let from the battery that are going to the two different lype bobs
4361,i discovered that the electricity is flowing through the metal on the light bulb holders,i discovered that the electricity is flowing through the medal on de lieale holders
4362,by pathways i mean the electricity flowing through the wires,by pathways i mean the electriscity f lowing through the wires
4363,this is a series circuit,this is a cerio circout
4364,we have been seeing what will what kind of metal will stick to magnets,we have been seing what will what kind of medtal will stick to magnets
4365,magnets will just stick to anything that is iron or steel,magnes will juststick to anything that is iron or steel
4366,i mean like um the magnet is attracting the paper clip,i mean like ahm the magnet is attracting the paper clip
4367,yes i did,yes i did
4368,we found out that iron and steel stick to magnets,we found out tha irn and steel stick to magnets
4369,then the magnetism would not go through to the other magnet from one,then the magnatisom would not go through to the other magnets from one
4370,we have been learning about um electricity and magnetism,we have been learning about um electriscity and magnatisom
4371,the thing that surprised me the most was magnetism travelling through the iron or steel object so it could pick up more of those things,the thing that surprised me the most was magnatisom traveling through the irn or steeal object so it could pick up more of those things
4372,the two magnets are sticking to each other and if you've one magnet around then the other one will follow it,the two magnets are sticking to each other and if you move one magnet around then the other will follow it
4373,good,good
4374,um the the magnet is pulling the paper clip through the paper but if it's too thick it won't work,um the the magnet is pulling the paper clip through the paper but if it's too thick it won't work
4375,they are attr they're attracting and and if if you move it around then they will still be sticking together,they are athey're atracting and and if if you move it around then they will still be sticking together
4376,i mean turn around like it's facing the opposite way that it should be,i mean turn around like it's facing the opposite way that should be
4377,i mean like um break the force of attraction,i mean like um break the force of attraction
4378,we learned that the the bigger number of spacers the less washers it would take to break the force of attraction,we learned that the the bigger number of spacurs the less washers it would take to break the force of attraction
4379,the magnet is s stuck to nail and and the magnetism is travelling through the nail so the nail would stick to the paper clip and it's called the temporary magnet,the magnet is stuck to the nail and and the magnatisom is traveling throughthe nail so the nail would stick to the paper clip and that's call a temperary magnet
4380,it won't stick to aluminum chrome or um tin,it won't stick to aluminum crom or um tin
4381,intestines absorb nutrients and water into the bloodstream and compact solid waste,testins sor ntrs and water into the blud stream and compack soi solid wast
4382,they're both the digestive system i think,tey're both the giesticistom i think
4383,i notice that they both have dots but the other one one of them has like has like squares and stuff around it but the other just has just is just yeast just,i knowicse that they both have dogs but the othe  one of tem has like has like squars in staff round up but the other one just as just as yas se u
4384,it moves food down into the stomach like after you chew it it goes down in the esophagus to go into the stomach to go into the small intestine to go into big intestines and to go into the waste,it moves fed down into the stumic like after you'd chwit it goes down the sophicgest to go into the stumr to go int the lawtestaince to go ing to the biggontestins to come into the wast
4385,i don't know what's up with it,i don't know at's up with it
4386,i see skin cells,i see skinsells
4387,stomach further breaks down food through mechanical and chemical,make further breaks town food through mcmegmacanical and cemical ac
4388,says that mouth breaks breaks food down in smaller pieces with teeth and saliva i already knew that by watching a video just to let you know,does that mouth briks don't breaks food down the in smaller pieces with teeth and selvai arady knew that by washing of ideall just lugh
4389,the human and the plant also different i don't know they're just,the human in the plant also different i don't know theyre just
4390,uhm that it's living and humans are living so they're both living,u that it's lbaniand humans are living so eos living
4391,this this picture is the digestive system learning about the digestive system and this this thing here is the digestive system for the butterfly,thispit this picture is the ti justlearning about the ug justif istome and this thing here is the gargusti sstumfor the butterfly
4392,it's showing us like everything about how it works yeah stuff like that,it's showing us leg everythii think about  wat works yeah at's o
4393,i'm good,i'm good
4394,it goes through like the small intestine and it goes to through to the big intestines to come into the waste and then it goes out,it goes through like the smallentestinas and it goes to tet through to the big ntestinas to come into the wast and then it goes out
4395,i notice muscle or whatever that those little things are that are in the like leg,i notice muscle or whatever that to thinges are that i know like
4396,nothing i don't know,nothing i dont no
4397,i think it's showing us the digestive system and how the rest of your body's like the little intestines and the big intestines and it goes through and it becomes waste,i think it's sure s the be justitis elling   t thos  s like the little cestins of pig in estinsid  ace  becomes
4398,we've been studying about,w's ben stuyingng about me
4399,the stomach it holds like all of the food that goes down the esophagus and then it goes into the small intestine well it's all of the food that you chew down,tis tu make it holds like all of the food that goes down th sopfhics and then it goes inopulls pull of food that you chut down
4400,that they're brain cells,that thei'r brainseles
4401,the the digestive system but the but the butterfly has the digestive tract and the human has the called,the si d usticsistom but the but the butterfly has to dy justithe ju justis trap and the human hecalled
4402,i think that will be the lungs i am not sure i am just take it lot guess but i'm pretty sure it'd be the lungs,i think that would be the lungs i'm not sure and i'm just taken ta all guess but i'm praty sure tobe the lungs
4403,i am not i don't i think this i don't know,m not i don't i think that's the i don't know
4404,it's showing about your breathing how it goes how your lungs get bigger and smaller and then bigger and smaller like when you are when you breathe in it goes bigger but when you breathe out it goes small,it's showing you about your breathing how it goes how your lungs get bigger thand smaller and then bigger and smaller like when you when you breathe in it goes bigger but when you breathe out it gos smal
4405,i have no clue,i have no cle
4406,either from the mouth or the nose and it goes through the throat,ee from the mouth or the nse and it goes through thethroat
4407,so this is d you're talking about it was the it's looks like d that's all i know but it's like a sort of yellow bar thing and it moves up and down and it's like kind of pushes our lungs,it starcs the de you ere talking about it it was theit' cort f the dd tat's all knon but it's like the it's little yellow barthing and it moves up and down and it like kind of pushes or lons
4408,i don't know,i don't know
4409,i see co two like coming and going like blue co two is going in and the o two is coming on to it and i don't it's something like i don't,i see ze o to like coming in and going like the bloo cero t is going in the and the oah to is coming on to it and i don't nsomething like that
4410,it easier it needs to comes in from your nose and your mouth,e esurt ein the esin wour nose ve mo
4411,i don't know,i don't know
4412,i don't know,i don't know
4413,what did you see,what  see
4414,i would say either a or b or e,i would say either ea or be or ea
4415,i don't know,i don't know
4416,i am good,i'm good
4417,maybe a decomposer,may be de compose
4418,it tells me that worms and mushrooms eat different things and caterpillars roly poly and beetles,it tells me that warms and mushrooms eat different things and um catta pillers really puls and beatles
4419,i'm not sure,i'm not sure
4420,i think it's a decomposer but i'm not very sure,i think at the decomposure but i'm not very sur
4421,i think pine cone grass the mushroom and the bacteria,i think pine cone grass the mushroom in the lecturia
4422,a snake,a snake
4423,that's cool,that's cool
4424,it's a consumer because you eat they eat other animals,it's a consumer because yut ea other ither animals
4425,the ground,the ground
4426,i don't know,i don't know
4427,cause because bears that's all that really eats meat and hippos but the other animals don't really eat meat they eat like bananas and other stuff,cause um because beares that's all that really eats meing and hippos but the other animals don't reallymeat meat the like vananas and tother stuff
4428,the owl a bird the beetle a lizard the bunny and the snake,the owl the brd the beit ltierved the bune the and the snake
4429,that they make soil,but they make soil
4430,that means that they they are i don't know,that mean said they they are i don't no
4431,i think it's the water in the ground or the sun all the energy that's in the sun i think helps the plants grow,i think it's um the water in the ground or the sun all the energy that's in the sun i think helps the plants grow
4432,i can not hear you right now,i can not hear you right now
4433,a snake,a snake
4434,why do you hate me so much i don't know cause i can't hear you you're making me so bad right now,why do you hate me so much i don't know because i can't eare you maken me so mad i kno ca
4435,i don't know,i don't know
4436,because they all eat meat cause the tiger the lion the wolf and the shark and all of them eat meat so that's pretty much how they connect,because they all eat me cause the tiger the lion um the wolf an the shark and all of them meat meat so that's prtty much how they candet
4437,thing that makes them really fat,seing that makes them really fat
4438,it is a mushroom,it is a mush room
4439,we've been learning about systems and decomposers composers and producers,we've been learning about sistoms and decomposers composers and producers
4440,they're all about i think the soil and other stuff i'm not really sure i can't remember,the're all about um i think um thsoil and other stuff um i'm not really sure i can't remember
4441,they're a consumer because bacteria and fungi they do pretty much the same thing to animals and foods,they are consumer because bactiriaand funguy they do prety much like the same thing to animals andfoods
4442,a carnivore,a carnowar
4443,carnivore,coner
4444,i think it's a consumer because it eats other consumers they eat plants and meat but still it eats consumers like a lot of different things like people fish,i think it's a concumy because  eat others concumers  plants and met but still leaing to the concumers like a lot of different things like people  fish a
4445,a living organism,a living orgonisom
4446,bacteria,vactaria
4447,carnivores eat other carnivore,convoers ea other clinoor
4448,i think it's about i think it's about carnivores and i think,i think it's about i think it's about hieors convrs m arminrs and dinrs i think
4449,can you please repeat,can you please repe
4450,it it helps the environment actually because they eat paper and other stuff so i think that helps the environment,it it helps the environment actually because they eat paper another stuffs so i think that helps the environ
4451,they make soil and help plants grow,they make soil and help plants grow
4452,i think an eats more like plants and like leaves and and more leaves and more stuff like yeah just plants i guess,i think an r before eats more like plants and like leaves and bamboo and more leaves and more stuff like ye out just plants i gues
4453,they both eat they both eat like leaves,they both eat play they both eat like leaves
4454,hello,h
4455,a decomposer,a decomposer
4456,a bear,a bear
4457,because if they're outside there might be an easier way for them to like hide of birds and stuff,because if they wre outside them i pean easier waiy for them to like hide of birds an stu
4458,carnivore,confor
4459,made it all,meea et all there
4460,is that tomato juice,is that' he made of yeurs
4461,to help it grow because like it has to have fresh air nice cool water and sunlight to to grow,to help it grow bcause ligke yit has to have fresh air nice col water and sunlight te gro
4462,well it has everything it has a water the air the sunlight and everything it needs to grow and look,well it has everything t has a water the air of the sunlighe everything it needs to grow and look ber
4463,it needs sunlight to grow because if it doesn't have any sunlight it just flops,it needs sonlight to grow because if it doesn't have any sunlight it just flop
4464,well it just needs water oxygen carbon dioxide sunlight and yeah that's about it to survive,well it just needs water oxen carmond by ogside at sunlightand at's about it ti arive
4465,well it looks a little better but it still needs water to grow because like that's the main thing that it needs it needs the water to get it all like all like woo awake so it can grow more,ell it looks little better but it's o needs water to grow cause like that's the meain thing that it needs it needs the water to git it like alike wo awake so it can grow mo
4466,because it has all the sunlight it need all the air it needs and all the water it needs,because it has all the sunlight and needs all the air needs and all the water needs
4467,make their own food because uhm i can't remember what it's called the sugar like the sugar leaves the stuff in the plant to for it to grow,make seral food puse um i cant remember what a wih sugur like the sugur feeds istuff in the plant trip for it to grow
4468,uh not sure,
4469,there's no air so that just makes it worse it's probably just going to die right away,r there's no air so that's just makes it worciprobly just gaing to die rght away
4470,uhm the one in the light bag that we did turned all green and all perfect and uhm the one in the dark back turned all yellow and it didn't have as much grown,um the one in the light bag that we did turned all green and all perfect and um the one in the dark bag turned like all yellow and it didn't have as much grown
4471,there's no sun,there's no sun
4472,i don't know,y kno
4473,no sure,asure
4474,the wings help him fly that's one of the adaptations and his yeah,the wings help him fly that's one f the abdabtations and his yeah
4475,i think it looks like he's looking for prey,i it looks like he's um looking for pr
4476,i think that's kind of instinctive because it just when you hit it just when you hit that part of your knee your knee just flocks up on its own so,i think that'san instintive bar beca because um it just when i hit it just when you hid that part of your nee your nee just flaps up onon on it's own so
4477,it protects from it protects them from like people like animals that are trying to either eat them or something like that,it potecs them they petecs them fm like people like animals that are trying to either eat them or something like that
4478,his shell,his shell
4479,not learned because you're not just taught you're just not taught like you're just oh it's time to come out now they just they just come out whenever they want to come out,nonlearned because yu'ent  you'ren just not taught like you'e just like alit was time to come out now they just u they just come out whenever they want t come out
4480,the grass the trees the water rocks dirt leaves lot of the leaves lots of water you know,the grass the trees the water rocks dirt leaves lots leaves lots of water e
4481,i am good i know why i guess so,i'm good an away i guess sid
4482,it depends because sometimes it just an instinctive but sometimes they have to be taught,it epends cause sometimes it dus the nonstin thing but sometimes they have to be taught
4483,i think there's a little is a a learned behavior,i think this little is a  learnedbehavieur
4484,it's his adaptation,it's his abdabtation
4485,and oh what know ah,end all no
4486,his skunk know much he spray that he sprays on on stuff so that's i think this one,his scunk kno but thit's pary that he sprays on peoon stuff so that's i think that's on
4487,what animal eats the other animal like let's say the hawk eats the bird the bird eats the hawk the bunny eats the hawk or the hawk or the bunny goes into the hawk so that means the hawk eats the bird i mean the bunny oh sorry,what animal eats the other animal like but say the hawk eat sper the bird eats the hawk the butneats the hawker the hawk r the butny goes into the hawk so at means the hawk eats the bird i mean the butney it's sorry
4488,i don't know,i don't know
4489,i'm good,i'm good
4490,i think it's about like water fish like living things,i think it's about like water fish like living things
4491,i think they're all about just just eating food i guess i i don't know,um i think the'reall about just just eating food i guess i i don't know it really
4492,i don't know what you mean,i don't know what you mean
4493,well they like work together to make a system i think,well they like work together to make a sistom i think
4494,i think it makes it a system but i the way what was i think i i don't know i've not very sure about that,i think it makes ia stume but they um the way it moves i think i i don't know i'm knot very sure about that
4495,i don't know,i don't know
4496,the eyes the heart and the organs,the eyes the heart in the orgaons
4497,i think i think it has to do with systems is because that there's a lot of things that can move like a human body a suitcase car the earth i don't know i'm not very sure,i think i think it has to do is sums is because that there's a lot of things that can move like a human body a sucase car the earth i don't know'not very sr
4498,i am not sure,i am not s
4499,because i don't know,because um i don't know
4500,we've been learning about producers consumers and consumers,we've been learning about producers the concumersan concumers
4501,because they can move i think i'm not very sure,because um  tecoul move i think i'm not vary suret
4502,i think they're like the same because they have to do with something like living things and the earth and trees and water and stuff and fish,um i think theyre like the same because um they have to do with something like living things and the earth and trees and water and stuff in fish
4503,i see water houses trees coral and i think that's a mountain,i see water houses trees qarels and i think that's a mountain
4504,i don't know,i don't know
4505,i'm not sure what they're called i think there is i think there's five or like ten or something i don't know,i'm not sure what they're called and um i think there isi think there's fin or like ten or something i don't know
4506,sorry what,sorry what
4507,i'm good,i'm good
4508,no not so far,no not so far
4509,it doesn't have c inches,it doesn't have sinches
4510,so you can measure stuff without a ruler,so you can measure stuff without a ruller
4511,yep,yep
4512,da uh we had different answers we had groups and then we had different answers and tha and that was because mister froller had changed the size of the straws,thewe had different answers we had groups and then we had different answers and tha and that was because mer purler had changed the size o the stras
4513,yeah i just started this week,ye to start this week
4514,yeah,yeah
4515,i would change,ouchange
4516,that some of them can be shorter and longer and that takes different measurements mmm hmm yeah,they some of them can be shorter and longer and that takes different measurments yeh
4517,that w ten centimeters would be half from my wrist to my elbow,nho ten cent meters would be half from my riskt to my elbows
4518,yeah and then we made our own meter sticks that has centimeters and decameters it but it doesn't have inches,eh and then we made our own metor sticks that has sunmeters and deckmeaters it but it doesn't have inches
4519,not exactly,not exactly
4520,uh i forgot,i forgott
4521,yeah cause sometimes you don't bring a ruler to where you're going and then you need to show where it is,yeh cause sometimes you don't bring a ruller to wheare you'e going and then you need to show where this
4522,yeah,yeh
4523,that's about from the back of this chair to olivia back there,that's about from the back of this chair to alivia back there
4524,yeah that means that it's ten straws across from me and then three straws this way,yeah that means that it's ten straws across from me and then three straws this way
4525,no,no
4526,we measured our desks in straws,we measured our desks and straws
4527,well that they are that they sometimes do wrong measurements cause they get bent and stuff and then that shrinks em a little bit,well that they are that they sometimes do wrong measurments cause they get bent and stuff and then that shrinks om a little bit
4528,that t the dry sponge is two grams the wet sponge is sixteen grams and the water wa so the water was fourteen grams,thet t the dry spunge is two grms the we spunge is sixteen grms in the water sothe water was fourteen grams
4529,t for scrubbing for scrubbing because you can get a lot of water in it and then when you push down the water comes out and then you can do the same thing to put soap in it,tfur scribbing first scribbing because you can get a lot of water in it and then when you push down the water comes out i' then you can do the same thing to put soap in it
4530,it's weighing it and the sponge is there and it's heavier than thin air,it's waging it and the spunch is there and is heaver than thin air
4531,two grams,two grayoms
4532,a balance,a balence so
4533,yeah absorbs it,yeah obsorb
4534,the sponge is growing bigger,thi spunge is growing bigger
4535,like yesterday we weighed like pencils and other stuff,lay yesterday we wihed like pencils and nother seff
4536,um it weighs sixteen grams mmm hmm,um that wt is sixteen grams y
4537,it has two grams in there and then it has a sponge on the other side and it's exactly equal,it has two grans and there and then it hats a spunge on other side and it's exactly equal
4538,from here i subtracted two to sixteen and that's fourteen s so that's how much the water was,from here i surdrected two to sixteen and s fourteen s so that's how much the water was
4539,no dry and then wet,no dry and then we
4540,no we didn't have enough time,no just y did't have enough times
4541,it's sucking it in and holding it in the air bubbles,it's  sucking it in and holding it in the air bubdles
4542,hi,i
4543,i didn't make a chart there was just questions to answer,i didn't make a chart there was just questions to answer
4544,yeah,yeah
4545,probably,probly
4546,that told me the mass of the water,that told me the mass of the water
4547,yeah,yeah
4548,yeah we had a little piece of paper to write it down on,yeah we had a little piece of paper to ride it down
4549,most of em,most of them
4550,that the water weighed a l had a lot of mass,that the water waied ahead a lot of mass
4551,yeah,yeh
4552,yeah,yeah
4553,yup,yuh
4554,with that it made it it made the water made the sponge in our way it made the sponge weigh fifty grams when it was only three,with that it made it it made the water made the spunge in our way it made this punge way fifty grams when it was only three
4555,the wa it's absorbing the water,the wtr it's absorbing the water
4556,it would start pouring out,it would start po not
4557,yep,yeh
4558,that all the little bubbles filled with water,that all the little bubbles filled with water
4559,yeah,yeah
4560,it's got a wet sponge that weighs,it's got a whet spunge that ways
4561,some a lot,some and hent helbit that a lot
4562,what did i do to figure out the difference i multiplied,what did i de to figure out the difference i'm multiplied
4563,yeah i took away to find,yeah i took away to fund
4564,yeah,yeah
4565,they all absorb,they all absorb
4566,probably um weighing other stuff,probbly um weying other stuff
4567,it would start slowly pouring out,it would start slowly poring out
4568,yeah,yeah
4569,because the point is pointing straight down,because the point is pointing straight down
4570,nothing just air,nothing just air
4571,no subtraction,no subjection
4572,well there e the water itself weighed forty seven grams,well ther the water itself weighed forty seven grons
4573,mmm hmm and that it ha was pretty heavy,and that it was pretty heavy
4574,yeah,yeah
4575,twenty st it could absorb e seventeen times as much,twenty smuchit could observe ight seventeen times as much
4576,they're probably is but i don't remember it,thei're probably is but i don't remember it
4577,we um built our boats out of little paper cups with wax,wee um bult her booats out of a little paper cups with wax
4578,well we used pennies as passengers and the size was important so that we could see how many passengers it could hold,well we used pennies ass passengers and the size was important so that we could see how many passangers it could hold
4579,see ya,cia
4580,you too,yo to
4581,um we would put the pennies in carefully and keep it balanced on all sides so that it didn't sink as quickly,um we would put the pennies in carefully and keep it baolenced on all sides so that it didn't sink ats quickly
4582,thank you,thank you
4583,they're designed to float and hold people,they'r designe to flot and hold people
4584,it sh they each show um how many milliliters of water they each hold,ich they each show um how many millleaters of whattever they each old
4585,each are different height and um they each sink uh lower and higher in to the water depending on how tall they are,each are a different hight and um they each sink u lower and higer into the water depending on how c ll they are
4586,they might have been um different cups and they might not have been equally um made and uh cut levelly,they might have been um different cups and they might not have been equally um made and uh cut lovely
4587,um it was uh like it was actually the water that we um took out of the things and then put them in this container that showed milliliters and that's how we got our results,um it was uh like it was actually the water that we um took out of the things and then put them in this container that should mell leaders and that's how we got our results
4588,um i was amazed to see that when we put the passengers in um um just a little cup of you put a circle around it and even the balance then it may it you could get a lot of passengers in there,m i was mace to see that when we put the passengers in um ah just a little cup if you put a circle around it and even the ballence then it mat it you could get a lot of passengers in there
4589,we made two boats that were three centimeters long,we made to boats that were three cente meters long
4590,by um doing them um correctly and orderly and uh slowly so that you can get uh accurate data,by um duing them um correctly and orderly and uh slowly so that youcan get a accurite dade
4591,um i had another day in science and uh we worked on boats and um we uh had variables and other like things and it was in like a little tub,um i had another day in cience and wile we worked on boats and um we um had veriables and other like things that it was ielike a little tub
4592,well when we measured them we made sure that they were each uh different um height and yeah,well when we measure them we made sure that they were each h different um height and yeh
4593,good,good
4594,you could may be add more pennies or take away the penny and add something um different like a different object to it,you could maybe add more pennis or take away the penny and ads something um different like a different object to it
4595,you have to pick it up and then let it swing and when it goes back and forth and like,you have to pick it up and then let it swing and when it goes back an forth an like
4596,that with the higher swings um the um in fifteen seconds it did um it had more cycles,that with the highere swings um the um in fifteen seconds it did umit had more sicalls
4597,when you put it at the top it starts but gradually it'll start to um decrease um in how high it goes cause there's not enough force and the weight is weighing it down,when you put it at the top it starts but gradually it'll start to um dcrece um and how high it gos cause there's not enough force and the waight is weing it down
4598,well when it swings back and forth the weight would cause it to sink lower and not go as high when it comes back around and completes the cycle,well when it swings back and forth the waight would cause it to sink lower and not go as high when it comes back around and compleats the sicles
4599,it means that it's a certain thing in an experiment that you could change or keep the same and it's part of the experiment,it means that it's a certain thing an an experiment that you could change or keep the same and it's part of the experiment
4600,well there is more um there is one on one and then like it goes in the number of how many there are and i think well well of course it will it would cause more weight,well there is more um there's one on one and then like it goes in the number of how ne there are n a end i think that well of course it was it would cause more weeat
4601,when i click the bob goes to where i clicked,when i click the bob goes to wheare i clicked
4602,what's the table for,what's e table pero colaga
4603,the cycle is when it goes back and back and then back again to where it used to be,the sike hole is when it goback and back and then back again to where it used to be
4604,yes,s
4605,yes,yes
4606,uh at the end of the string there is its weight and it will keep the string moving,h at the end of the string there's its waight and it will keep the string moving
4607,well since it's at the end of the string it will cause the string not to go flimsy and around,well since it's at the end of the string it will calse the string not to go flimzying around
4608,it goes down and up and then down and up again to uh the place where it was but it's still lower than,it goes down and up and then down an up agin to a the place where it was but it's still lower than
4609,i may put um something that's not a penny and may be it would cause more weight,i mayght put um something that's not a pennyion maybe it would cause more waigt
4610,may be if you um had a bigger pencil to hang it from then um it might uh affect may be how high it goes,maybe if you um had a bigger pencil to hangig it from then um it might effect imaybe how high it goes
4611,when i did it two times uh i realized that the cycles were the same both times,hene i did nt two times uh i realized that the sicl were the same bothtimes
4612,you can see how many times it will s make a cycle um in fifteen seconds,you can see how many times it will umake a sike ll ififteen seconds
4613,you can collect it on a data file,you can collect it on a day to file
4614,that would depend on what kind of variables they were and what they were changing,that would depend on what kind of veriables they were in what they were changing
4615,the longer the um pendulum the shorter amount of strings that uh i mean the shorter amount of cycles that it has,the longer the um pendulum the shorter amount of strings that u i mean the sort of amount of sikales that it has
4616,um well um i well i don't really know,m well m t well i don't  really know
4617,at the x axis um there's nothing,at the exaxes um there's nothing
4618,um the things that uh has been changed is the length of the string um which they swang,um the things that about its being changed isthe length of the string um which they swing
4619,that um the more the centimeters the less the cycles so it goes from one twenty to fifteen and it goes from seven to twenty,that um the more the centa meeters the lest the sical so it goes from one twenty to fifteen and it goes from seven to twenty
4620,bye,by
4621,yes because um because they only changed one variable from the longer uh string,yes because um because they only changed one veriable from the longer a string
4622,well we um didn't change the time because we knew for certain that there would more um swings if we changed the time,well we um didn't change the time because we knew for certaen that there would be more um swings if we changed the time
4623,i found out that the shorter the string the um the less uh cycles it has,i found out that the short athe string the umless u sicles it has
4624,i mean the more cycles that it has,i mean the more r cicles that it has
4625,um it's a pendulum with a bob at the end and it's on a high point um and it's hanging from a pencil,um it's a pendelum with a bob at the end and it's on at high point um and it's hanging from a a penciel
4626,it has certain fixtures and um it doesn't chang it doesn't change much,it has certaen fixtures and um it doesn't cha it doesn't change much
4627,um on the y axis,um on the wiaxes
4628,i mean things that we changed in um different series of the experiment,i mean things that we changed in a different series of the experiment
4629,they are um how many cycles and the length,they are um uh how many sicles and telength
4630,pretty good,pretty good
4631,i found the length of how um long the strings were and of how many cycles they had,i found the length of he um mong the strings were and of how many sicles they had
4632,uh i in science today i learned that when you tried the release position it doesn't change the length of how many cycles it did,b in science today i learned that when you try the releeace position it doesn't change the length of how many sicles it did
4633,well today we learned how to um uh we well we worked on pendulums again and we uh showed them at different angles and we changed um some variables,well today we learned how to um uh e well we worked on penger lems again and we u showd them at different angles and we changed them some veriables
4634,um so that things don't get out of control and you don't have too many um things that are not alike,uum s that things don't get out of control and you don't have too many um thinings that are nodtle like
4635,when it went um down and went back up again it went at a slightly lower uh place,when it went um down and went back up again it went at a slightely lor  place
4636,we were trying to find out how the pendulums worked and uh what made them different and what made them the same,we were trying to find out how the pendulums worked and of what made them different in what made them the same
4637,it doesn't matter uh how much weight there is um it just matters how long the string is,it doesn't matter uh how much wait there is um it just matters how long the string is
4638,it shows on the top uh how many cycles it had um on the side it shows how long the strings was,it shows the top f how many siicles it had and um on the side it showes how long the stringts was
4639,i would put it um after like after the name of the boat and i would put it there after in under the uh sign that says capacity and tell how many milliliters,i would put it um after like afteter the name of the boat and i would put it there after in under the a sign that said capassity and tell how many mellow leaders
4640,m you can figure out how many pennies can go in to it and how much water it can hold,you can figure out how many pennies can go into it and m how much water it can hold
4641,um we decided um to keep the kind of cup the it was and the construction of the cup and how it was cut not the length but yeah um we also decided how much water we had in the tub to keep the same and yeah,um we decided to keep uuthe condition of the ceum
4642,well we made four different sizes so that we could see how many pennies each could hold and the amount of water they could each hold,wel we made four different sizess so that we could see howmany pennies each god old and the amount of water they could each old
4643,they stay the same and um uh don't make the experiment too different than it might have u might have been or used to be,they stay the same and um u do' nt make the experiment differenchan it might have yu might have been or used to be
4644,oh i would put it on the bottom,i wold put it on the bottom
4645,and also setting up a data chart,and also setting up bade to cuirt
4646,the capacity goes on the bottom and uh the number of passengers goes on the side,the copassity goes on the bottom and of the number f passengers goes on the side
4647,we used the syringe to um uh take the water out and uh put them in a little container that measured in milliliters uh to see how many milliliters each cup could hold,use thi carange to m uh take the water out and then put them in a little container that measured mllo leaders ah to seeee how many millileaters each cup could hold
4648,uh i forgot what a standard procedure is,uh i forgot what a sandager proceeger is
4649,it doesn't um cause the boat to sink and then pop up again cause when it does that then the water might splash in to it and cause it to sink faster,it doesn't um cause the boat to sink and then pop up again causs when it does that then the water might splash into it and cause it to sink faster
4650,we uh used different uh heights in the cups and but we kept everything else the same and we only changed one variable which made it a controlled experiment,we ae used different a hights in the cups and but we kept everything elcse the same and we only changed one very able which made it a controlld experiment
4651,um the variable that's being changed is the height of the cups and yeah,um the verible that's being changed is the hight of the cups and yeah
4652,we had to think about how we were going to put them in and uh we had to predict how many would fit in there before it's sunk,e had to think about how we were going to put them in and uh we had to ber dick to how many would fit im there before it sunk
4653,we we um used the um wait,we we um used the mwait
4654,it um stays a controlled experiment,it a stay is a controlled experiment
4655,we changed the length of the cups to see how many how much water and how many pennies they could hold and the pennies were passengers,we changed the length of the cups to see how many how much water and how many pennies they could hol and the pennies ere passengers
4656,only one variable to keep it controlled,only one veveriable to keep it controld
4657,yeah yeah,yeah yeeah
4658,um standard's like um like more,um standerds like umlike moren
4659,um you,amu
4660,try to make it even,try u to make it even
4661,yeah,yeah
4662,yeah,yeaah
4663,yeah we did s um something with paper clips um well we got the different things because the paper cl because we were measuring the woodpile woods w and,yow we did s um something as paper clips um tt we got te different things because the paper c because we were measuring the wpla woods and
4664,yeah because we have a substitute,yeah because they have  subent
4665,yeah with the gravel,ya is the gravil
4666,um we were weighing um the metal first because that's because we need to see how much um they weigh but and,um we are weaing um the medo first because that's because weus see how much um the way but and
4667,math,mat
4668,so we got the um not right number,so he got th not wright number
4669,eh and we did another one hundred and we had to weigh how much um the gravel is and it was one thousand,and we did another one hundred and we had to waigh how much um the gravles and was one thousand
4670,yeah,yeah
4671,um we were putting the sponge in one cup a,um we were pulling the spunge ind one cup
4672,yeah but um you we'd have to do another gravel to make a thousand with another bag,y b me we have to do another grabble to make a thousand with another bag
4673,i'm not sure,i'm not sure
4674,um we first,um we first

4713,i say it's gonna be warmer,i say it's going to be warmer
4714,no then we um um we're finished we um used the temperature to see which one is the hottest and coldest to see if we're right or wrong we used uh,no then we um mmore finished we um used the temperture to see which one is the hotian cold us to se if wer wright were wrong musw use e
4715,we're measur we're temperaturing the water,were measure were temperturing the water
4716,um when the ice melts um the the water becomes warmer and warmer,um when the ice mels um the the water becomes warmer and warmer

4778,the battery is about oh the batte,the battery is about m the bath
4779,you already said that,you've already said that
4780,hi,high
4781,it doesn't really affect the light bulbs but i guess it reverses the flow of energy,it doesn't really effect the light bobs but i guess it reverces the flow of energy
4782,the battery's about sending electricity,the battery is about cending electricity
4783,because the motor's spinning which is a sign that the energy is flowing all the way through the circuit,because the motor spening which is a sign that the ennergy is flowing allthe way through the circlte
4784,hi,high
4785,bye,fye
4786,probably but we'd either have to cut a wire in half or get rid of one wire and get two shorter ones,probabbly a buck mead either have to hut a wir and half or get rid of one wier and get two shorter ones
4787,good,good
4788,what do you mean,what do you men
4789,cause um that one's made of one's made of plastic and one's made of wood one's made of metal probably the metal is the heaviest the pl then the wood then the plastic,ums because we um put it first just to see and it wi d't a lot more than the others

4945,um can you please repeat that,um can you please repeat that
4946,tually get to the light bulb which tells it to burn,e get to the light bull which tells it to bur
4947,um well the the wire has two different ends f for the energy to flow through it,um well the the wire has to different ens for the ennergy to flow through it
4948,are,or
4949,or make the light bulb go,or make the liht bal go
4950,okay,ok
4951,um da,um da
4952,yes i did,yes i de it
4953,the filament is the part of the light bulb that makes it light otherwise it'll just be a bulb but not one of the one's that you can plant,the fellement is the part of the light bull that makes it light othewizse it just be a bulbut not onef the ones that you can plant
4954,there are,there are
4955,basically an electricity circle,bace can alec christy circle
4956,and,and
4957,it either attracts or it either um comes to the light bulb or it goes away,it ither tracks or dit ither um comes to the li b or gos away
4958,yes,yes
4959,hello marnie,hello marny
4960,that balls that the smaller the ball the farther it went from the mass,th vals that the small i the all the farther it went from the mass
4961,the angle,the angle
4962,we've been testing the flippers and their variables,we've ben testing the flippers in their verables
4963,you change one variable at a time so you know what variable changed it,you change one verable at times ty know what erable change
4964,um if you didn't have the rubber bands it wouldn't move because the you you could spin the propeller but it wouldn't s uh keep going you it you could maybe get a full circle in,um if you didn't have the rubber bands it wouldn't move because the youd you could spind the prepeller but it wouldn'ts i'll keep going you i you could mabe get a full circle in
4965,well um the rubber it the propeller is has been spun up and and it spun the rubber band up and that then if you let go it will spin the opposite direction and move forward,well um the rubber it the prepellers has been spun up and it spun the rubber bandup and that then if you let go it will spin the opposit direction and move forward
4966,bye,vi
4967,no,no
4968,hello,tho
4969,yeah,yeah
4970,um we've been making planes and f um flying them on fishing wire,um wefen making plains and um flying them on fishing wier
4971,i mean you want to um make sure everything is right um like try you try to get everything that you can to have a good experiment,im you want t uum make suure everything is right um like try t you try to get everything that you can to have a ga good experiment
4972,um well the winds the more the like the fifty one would go the farthest distance and then the ten would go the less distance the least,um well the winds the the more like the fifty one would go the ffarthest distancand sod then the ten would go the lesest the least
4973,um so the the ones without the paper clips goes the farthest and the ones with the most paper cl clips goes the least,um so the the ones without the paper clips go s the farthest and the ones with the most paper gclips gos the least
4974,um i want to figure out if if you had more on um how would it affect how if flies,um i wanted to figure out it if if you had more on um ha would it effect how it flies
4975,uh number of winds,number of winds
4976,um that if you did change them it would affect uh how if flies,uhm that if you did change them it would effect of how it flies
4977,thank you,thank you
4978,ciao,cho
4979,uh the number of passengers,u the number of passengers
4980,um well you have to you should only change one variable at a time or else you never know which one is right,um weell you have to you should only change one veriable at a time or else you never know which one is right
4981,how far the distance i mean just the distance,how far the dist i mea just te distance
4982,cause if you changed all of the all the var more than one variable you never know which one is right,cause if you changed all of he all the ver more than one veriable you never know which one is right
4983,um well we thought through what would be the best way to get the plane across um and er farther and that's wh that's basically what we thought,um well we thought through what would be the best way to get the plane across um and ur farther and that's w that's pacically what we thought
4984,the independent variable is the paper clips,the independant veriable is the paper clips
4985,um independiv independent variable is that you just tra change one thing at a time and if you if you change more than one thing at a time it you wouldn't be controlling a good variable,um the inrependanant independant veriable is that you just chat change one thing at a time and if you if you change more than one thing at a time it you wouldn't be controll ing a good veriable
4986,uh the ones that you don't test that's probably the things you think are not going to work and then the things that you do test are probably going to be the things that you um will test,u the ones that you don't test that's probly the things that you think are not going to work and then the things that you do test are probligan o be the things that you um will test
4987,um you'd get more accurate um answers and things,uhm you'd get more accurite um answers and things
4988,um so the top is the variable number of i mean the first one is the number of winds the second is how many passengers there are and then the third one is the distance,um so the top is the veriable number of i man the first one tis the number of winds the second is how many passengers there are and then the third one is the distance
4989,good,ge
4990,um we're trying the experimental variable i mean experiment is what we're trying to figure out um we're trying to figure out how far it will go,um we're trying the experimentveria bi mean experiment is what we're trying to figure out um wore trying to figure out how far it 'll go
4991,um we were trying to figure out if the distance goes up when we add passengers or if it goes down when we add passengers,um we were trying to figure out if the distance gos up when we aded passengers ore if it goes down when we aded passengers
4992,um you want to,um you want o
4993,hello,hello
4994,the higher it is um the more you can fit in cause it takes longer for the boat to sink that and get water to for water to go into the cup,the hiheret is um the more you can fit in bcause it takes longer for the boat to sink the end get water to for water to go into the cup
4995,not a lot,no
4996,um we've been learning about boats and how much they can hold,um we've been learning about boats and how much they canhold
4997,um it it's telling you the number of the cup and how much it can hold,um its telling you the number of the cup and how much it can hold
4998,um well we're te we're te trying to see if the bigger it is the more it can hold and the if the smaller it is and it how much it can hold,um well we're te were te trying to see if the bigger it is the more t can hold an ths if the smaller it is and i how much it can hom
4999,um m making if you want to hold a lot you would make the boat wide and higher and um you could you'd even out the weight,um make ye if you ouldn't hold a lot you would make the boat wide and hihre and um you you'd even out the wait
5000,um it was it weighed down to the right side and then it just um got water in it and fell to the gro bottom of the tank,um it was it waved down to the right side and then it just um got water in it and fell to the grat bottom of the tank
5001,um the bigger it is the more pennies it can hold,um the bigger is the more pennies tit can hold
5002,okay,oka
5003,it keeps on spinning at the same level,it keeps on spining at the same level
5004,um one will swing for a little bit then s slow down two will go longer and then so and so,um one will swing for a little bit then slow down too wil go longer and then so on so
5005,it will swing eight swings for in fifteen seconds,it wals swing eight springs for in fifteen seconds
5006,um the thirty eight one it will swing for,ah the thirty eight one it will swing fur
5007,um that it would probably swing the least amount,um that it would probably swing the least amount
5008,uh we have we've been learning about um pendul pendulums and how they work,oh we have we've been learning about um pendulum pendulums and how they work
5009,yes,yes
5010,good,good
5011,um they're about um like how things like how they move like how they keep on spinning,um there about um like how thing like how they move like how they keep on spinning
5012,yep,up
5013,um it's a pendulum it the penny is what keeps it spinning,uh it's ah pendellim i the penny is what keeps it spinning
5014,so the shorter one um swung longer than the thirty eight centimeter,so the shorter one um swong longer than the thirty eight cen a meter
5015,what keeps it swinging,what keeps it swinging
5016,if you didn't have the x axis you really wouldn't have a graph cause you just have the number of swings and it would be not really a full graph,if you didn't have the exexiss youreally wouldn't have a graf cause youd just have the number f swings and it would be not really ye a fotigraf
5017,um well we've been doing pen pendulums and we started doing p um graphs about them today,um well we'v been doing ped pendulims and we started doing p um grafts about them today
5018,good,good
5019,um the shortest of length the string is swinging the most and then the longer string is swinging the least,um the shortest length of string is swinging the most and then the longest tring is swinging the least
5020,um this one is about um how long the string is and how many um swings it did,um well this one int is about um how long the string is and how many um swings it did
5021,um if you it wouldn't be a controlled variable,um i you it wouldn't be controllveriable
5022,could you you use um a graph and yeah,could yoou you use um agrapfh and yeah
5023,um in the bottom it shows the length of the string and on the side it shows the number of swings,um then the bottom it shows the length o the string ind on the side it shows the number of swings
5024,um well if well the shortest the shorter strings would swing longer and the longer string would swing um the least,um weu if well the shortest the shorter strings would swing longer and the longer swing would swing um the least
5025,you could describe the flip stick about um,u you could describe the flip stick about uhm
5026,um this is showing um the how high it's going like at h the highest point and it's going about,twenty seven scenimaitors
5027,um it's g it's going over and over again and it's doing the same thing,um it's it's going over and over again and it's doing the same thing
5028,it has the lines on it which is probably in centimeters so you could that's another variable you could change is trying every s sin like one centimeter at a time,it has the lions on it which is probably inenmeters so you could that's another veriable you could change is trying every ssing like one sentameter at a time
5029,um today we started making catapults,um today we started um making um cat pulds
5030,uh the wooden one is the flipper base and then these are the two corks here um and then the flip stick and the angle brace,u the woodden one is the flipper bace and than these are the two corks ere uhm and then the flip stick and the angle brace
5031,um on on this there's um uh c just a plane cork like and then the other one is the rubber cork,um on on this there's um oh c just a plane cork like and then the other one is the rubber cork
5032,yep,ye
5033,good,good
5034,um well the string is going across and then no the the same parts working the same ways like nothing's falling off of it nothing's stopping or anything,um well the string is going across and then nothis the same parts are working the same ways like nothings falling offr  nothing stoppingerndhang
5035,um the the paperclip is the most important part cause if you didn't have that you c couldn't flip anything with it,um the the paper clip is the most important part cause if you didn't have that you ccouldn't flip anything with it
5036,uh it's like probably the biggest part in the flipper system cause if you didn't have the flip stick it wouldn't it wouldn't the flip system wouldn't be able to flip anything,uh it's like probly the biggest part in the flipper sistom cause if you didn't have the flip stick it wouldn't it wouldn't the flip sistom wouldn't be a littl flip anyhing
5037,um they're important because if you didn't have some of them the it you wouldn't be it wouldn't fly the right way as if you did have all the parts together,um thei're important because if you didn't have some of them that it you wouldn't be it wouldn't fly the right way as if you did have all the part together
5038,the flip stick is um it's the what's gonna go in the base and that's what's gonna flip the cork,the flip stick is um it's what's going o go in the base and that's what's going to flip the cork
5039,the if you didn't have the base the pa the popsicle stick couldn't go anywhere couldn't be held anywhere so it wouldn't be able to flip anything,the if you didn't have the base to p the posticle stick couldn't go anywhere couldn't be held anywhere so it wouldn't be able to flip anything
5040,um you could onl it's a controlling a good variable is when you um only switch one thing at a time,um you con y it's a controll in a good veriable is when you um only swich one thing at a time
5041,not a lot,nod a lot
5042,um we started today learning about life about boats and how much weight they can hold,um we started today learning about life about boats and how much weit they can hold
5043,yeah,yeah
5044,if it was um if it was the water was like not even an inch high it would um just hit the bot the cup would hit the the boat would hit,if it was um if it was the water was like not even in in try it would um just hit the bot the cup would hit the the boat would hit
5045,yep,yup
5046,the boat would hit the bottom and like just come right back up without getting water in it,the boat would hit the bottom and like just come right back up without getting water in it
5047,yep,ye
5048,um the l location of the penny um uh lower it will fit more and the higher it is it will probably you uh fit less pennies in,um the location of the penny um u lower it will fit more and the highere  s it will probly you u fit less pennies and
5049,um maybe making the boat higher or longer to fit more people in,um maybe making the boat higher or longer to fit more people in
5050,well we first put the boat in with no no pennies in it,well we first put the boat in with no no pennies in't it
5051,they don't mix together,they don't mix together
5052,it floats,it floats
5053,good,good
5054,it flows down the i mean,it flows down deep i mean
5055,they don't mix together the yellow one is more dense and the blue one is less dense,they don't mixt together the yellow one is more dun and the blue one is less dan
5056,why,ry
5057,the solution a was in first and solution b was in last,the sellution a was in first until it sould be was  in last
5058,solution a has less salt then solution b that's why solution b is more concentrated then solution a,sellution a has less sault than selutin be that's wice seli be is um more concintrat than sellutin
5059,they label them to tell you how to dense are,they lable them to tell you how dence they are
5060,because you did it the other way around and it mixed together,because you didn't the other way around and it mixed together
5061,when it's more concentrated it can be less dense and then one it's less concentrated,when it's more concentratit it can be less denc and then when it's less concntrate
5062,the penny is more dense and the cork is less dense,the penny is more denc and the cor is less dan dent
5063,it flows on top of the of solution b,it flots on top of the of sallution be
5064,it goes down to the bottom and set up floating on top of the water,ih goes down into the bottom instead of floting on top of the water
5065,the other concentration it is not it is not mixed other with the other concentration,the other concintration does not um does not mix together with the other concintration
5066,the flow over the crok the other kind of dense is,they flot over the c the other ined of dencit
5067,they are drinks,they or drink
5068,well you're working on like plants and animals in food webs an all that,well we were working on like plants and animals and food weabs and all that
5069,which one is like darker,which one is like darker
5070,see okay,cok
5071,good,got

5107,i don't understand you,i don't understand you
5108,ome good um some good ways to make estimates are to um see half of it and then if it's fifty milliliters it's one hundred milliliters,um good um some good ways to make timits are to um see half of it and then if it's fifty mileears it's one hundred nobl leaders
5109,i can't understand you,i can't understand you
5110,this tool's all about holding the water and how much me and it um sa it says how much milliliters it the the water um how much water there is in mil milliliters,this tulls all about holding the water and how much mand it um it says how much mila leaers itther the water um how much water there is inmimi leaers
5111,i learned that they're all different shape but they hold the same amount of water,rather an that they're all different shape but they hold to seing e mount of water
5112,hi,high
5113,the syringe we used was hard to push out and it holds the water,the  rused was hard to push out and it holds the water
5114,if you know how much fifty milliliters is and it's a little bit more than fifty milliliters you can guess it's like sixty or s um fifty five,if you know how much fifty millo leederss and it's a little bit more than fifty mils you can guess it's like sixty or s  fifty five
5115,we measure uh with cups milliliters and liters,we measure of its cups midl leaders and leaders
5116,they all they all um hold two hundred milliliters but they're just different sa sha shapes and sizes no not um they're all just different shapes,they all they all um holed two hundred eo leaters but they're just different sa shapes shapes and sizes no not m at all just different shapes
5117,we have been measuring um ho um mass and how much a sponge can hold and how much uh what milliliters are and liters,we have been measring um  u mass and how much o spunge can hol and how much u what milow leaders are ian leaders
5118,it shows you how many milliliters the water is,it shows you how many millow leaders the water is

5220,they are magnetic now you know they are magnetic,they are magnettic
5221,iron,iern
5222,the iron nail sticks while the aluminium one doesn't because the aluminium nail does not have any iron in it,the irn nail sticks while the lounum one doesn't because the lounop nail does not have any irn in it
5223,it must have a complete circuit,m the it must have a compleet circet
5224,that is the evidence of energy,that is the evidance of energy
5225,incomplete and electricity is flowing from the solar cell to the motor,in completed an ectrcty is flowing from the soller rese to the motor
5226,works and it spins and it is making a complete or closed circuit,works and it spins and it is making a c compleet or close circut
5227,the light is not hitting the solar cell so therefore the the motor can not be powered,the light is not hitting the soller slf so there fore the um the motor cannot be powered
5228,the motor is spinning because the solar panel is connected to the motor,um the motor is spinning because the soller pandl is connected to the motor
5229,you don't have a good day,you don't have ted
5230,showing that it is showing a full circuit the d cell to the motor and the evidence of it is that the flag is moving around in circles,showing that it is showing a full circet the decile to the moter and the evidence of it is that the flag is moving around in circles
5231,the switch has to touch the other thing,um the swish has to touch the other thing
5232,is a light energy to electricity,is sa light energy to um electricity
5233,i noticed that when it is touching the motor spins and when it is not the motor stops,i notice that when it is touching the moter sp and when it is not the moter stalks
5234,d cell would not work because it does not store energy and it is not getting the a light so it can not run,yosel would not work because it doese not store energy and it is not getting the a light so it can not run
5235,stops and the electricity no longer has a pathway to flow through,stops and the ogear city no longer has a pathway to flow through
5236,the it has to complete a full circuit,the at ha complet a full circet

5238,the motor starts spinning because it is sunny but in the cloudy picture it stops,the motor starts spinning because it is sunny but in the cloudy picture it stops
5239,before the electricity didn't move in a complete circle but now it has a pathway to,for the oatre ack tjust id he didn't move in a compleet circle but now it has a path way too
5240,the motor stops spinning,the moter stops spitting
5241,this has a switch and if the switch is touching that is a closed circuit but if the switch is not touching it is an open circuit,this has a swish and if the swish is touching that is a closecrcet but if the swish is not touching it is an open circut
5242,air is flowing through,eris flowing through
5243,it must be in a full circuit,um it must be in a full circuet
5244,good,good
5245,a full circuit is being created and energy is flowing to the motor,a full circet is being created an energy is flowing to the motor
5246,makes a full circuit,makes a folle circut
5247,the d cell is powering the motor,the desall is pring the motor
5248,good,good
5249,then doing things while like clean energy and all of that,ben doing things w like clean energing all that
5250,the wax is being used,the wax as being used
5251,i can tell that because she is moving and she is getting that energy from the apple,i can tell that because she's moving and she's getting the energy from the apple
5252,will pollute air,swill bleair
5253,a human is hitting a drum which is making sound energy,a huminat is hitting a drum which is making sound energy
5254,using up energy to produce another type of energy like heat or light energy,using up eanergy to progucse another type of eanergy like he or light eanergy
5255,they both are clean energy and do no produce emissions,they both of quean energy and do not produce abmitions
5256,ever to see you again because you are so rude,ever to see youagain becase yours o rt
5257,coal,cool
5258,it sounded like crackling,it sounded like crockoling
5259,the apple and the and i see a candle wax and an apple and wood,in the apple at the field berse and i cee a canda wax an appl um carl and wood g
5260,they both are clean energy resources,um they both are clean and er resources
5261,almost everything that we use,is everything that we use
5262,i see a candle burning wax and since the wax is burning the candle getting energy,i see a candle burning wax in cence the wax was burning the candale is getting energy
5263,yes,yes
5264,one the solid and one is a liquid,ones  solid and one is a liquid
5265,you get you hear a sound,you get you heare a sound
5266,they both are uses emissions that are not clean energy and they both pollute,they both rused immitions and are not clean energy and they both palute
5267,it gets polluted,it gets pluted
5268,a negative effect and would pollute the air,a neggutive effect and would polute the air
5269,natural natural gases,natural natural gasses
5270,the coal and gas produce a harmful emissions and pollute the air well that thing the solar cell and the wind turbine they do not and they are clean energy,the colling gass produce um harm full abmitions and pallute the air well um the that thing the sollersells in the winter bine they do not and they are clean eannergy
5271,it is giving up heat and light,it is giving off heat and light
5272,no,no
5273,we've been learning about circuits and things related like that,e'v ben learning about circuts and things were lited like that
5274,the light bulb is making light,the lipebal was making light
5275,the d cell,the dso
5276,is the electricity,bes the eltr said he
5277,the negative side i told you that five times now,the neggutive side i told you that five times o
5278,it starts working,it starts workin
5279,it switches,it switches
5280,it did not work because the because it's not making a full circle,it did not work because the because it's not making a full circle
5281,it means that they're a pathway for electricity,it means that there'ar potway for a ok city
5282,it flows from one end to the other end,it flows from one end to the other end
5283,it's going from the negative to the bulb casing and then it's coming out through the other wire to the positive side,it's going from the negutive to the boat casing and then it's coming out through the the other wire um to the po si
5284,to negative and it's making a complete circuit,to negutive and it's making a compleet circuet
5285,cell produces energy to light the bulb,ill produce a energy to light the bull
5286,they carry electricity i told you three times now,they carrie atrecity i told you three times now
5287,i noticed that it flipped around and started going into the positive and out the negative,i noticed that it slipped around and started going um into the positive and elt the negutive
5288,there's a d cell a light bulb and wires,is a dso a liht bobe and wires
5289,electricity,gciy
5290,i just like told you,m i just like told you
5291,means light,eans like
5292,be connected together,be conected together
5293,the components to make a circuit,the combonents to make a circut

5296,electricity,t i a
5297,it is going from the negative to the bulb casing and then it's coming back out again to the positive side of the d cell,it is going from the neggative to the bulb casing and then its coming back out again to the posive side of the desal
5298,electricity i just said that,tristity i just said that
5299,that it is a closed circuit,that it is a close circout
5300,good,good
5301,produce light,produce light
5302,source of energy,source of energy
5303,they connect the the the power source to the motor or the light bulb,they connect the um the the pouer source to the motor or the lybul
5304,it is a closed circuit,um it is a close circoet
5305,i noticed that it is not making a complete circle,i noticed that it is not making a complet circle
5306,they're wires,ther wires
5307,i noticed that it flipped around,i noticed that at fliped around
5308,i see that those light and those heat and there looks like the can those marking but will using because it's just fire moving,i see that thit was a light and os heat and it looks like the cano as meulting but it well isn't because it's just a fighere moving
5309,bye mornie,biymony
5310,those gas those coal those yeah those gas and coal,there was gasas col co tas col thesit was ye  was guessing co
5311,one gets turn by wind and one takes some for energy but they don't harm those and they both,one gets t by wind and one takes ttakes um some frnalgy but they don't hum the os and and they both don't hum the o
5312,those sound energy and there is also food energy because you need the food energy to make your hands move to do that,the  sound enalgy and es also fod elgy paus you need the food anmldy to make you hains move to to do that
5313,that's that like it will like learn how the faster if we keep using it to,that um that like it'll like it will run out fast ofif we keep using it oh
5314,we have been learning about series circuits,we have been learning about silly circuts
5315,it's making sound in that sound is sound energy sound energy,it's making sound and that sound is sound and g soundan og
5316,food energy and sound energy,food don' know ge and soun anal gy
5317,it,it
5318,the gas and coals are pollute that also and also panels in the wind turbines won't,ju gess m closill palute the hearth and the soll pandals in thewintor bines won't
5319,it's not really moving because it just the light like moving so it makes and look like the wax is moving,it's not l moving because it's just ait's just e light like moving so it makes it loo like the wick is moving
5320,it's turns to exhaust and exhaust will pollute the air,t its m turneds into exoust an exostible plute th
5321,i was a candle in its layer and it looks like it giving off heat energy and light energy,twas a candele an it's lt and it looks like it's givving off heat annegy and light aneargy
5322,giving off giving off light and heat,giving off  ving of light and heat
5323,heat energy and light energy,he an gin light and oky
5324,it will pollute the air,it will lu ti
5325,one is like a liquid and one is just like a rock it's just solid,one is one is like a a liquid and one is just like like a lock it's just sollid
5326,the wax is burning because its the candle is giving off heat energy from the fire,tothe wax is borning  because it's the canda was getting off he aogy from the fie
5327,no it will no you do not you don't have anything those and all sound and due to a,no you wo know you do not you don't hel anything those no sound and o to it
5328,i see i guess can i see would i see apple and see moved in a c candle,i see i i guess can i see wood i see apples i see mole wood and i see a candle
5329,from food,from food
5330,light and light energy,light and an light analgy
5331,it wouldn't pollute the air,i it wouldpalut y ould alut it
5332,it gets polluted,it gets balooted
5333,we know impact because it's not holding though while it may it's just like looking at sun and the sun is giving the energy and that's all it's not harming the old saddle forethere if,be no inpact because it's not hoding the nvilment it's it's just like looking at the sun and the sun is giving a energy and that's all it's not hamming dul sat all old al
5334,the electricity comes from the d cell and then moves thorugh the wire to whatever hooks up to the wires,tol tristy comes from the dica and that moves ss he wies to whatever s hocked up to the wiles
5335,the d cell is giving power from the negative both the negative and the positive side into the wires makethe light bulb light light bulb light,the dsaw was giving powel from the neggotive both the neggutive and the positive side into the witers to make the light wil light light bullb light
5336,flows from it flows from the d cell into the light bulb to the filament and back to that,blows from it flows from the deesal into the lihe poll tew the fillement and back g
5337,it has to flow to the d cell into the batteries to take them light i mean into the light bulbs to make them light,it has to flow through the dee so into the batteryes to make them light i mean into the ligpe wops to make them light
5338,we've been building series circuits,we've been building sillys sogets
5339,to be needs should be two wires going from the negative and the positive side from the d cell and from the bottom and the light bulb and from this side,e need  be two wires going from the the neggut they ran the bo inside bum the d sail t d sell and from the bottom of the li bulb and from ther side
5340,that represents the electricity that is flowing,that reppresents the letricity that is floing
5341,it can powers things that are like one time that usually has wires the d cell may be motor some light bulb is may be it's,it can powl things that like one time it usuy has wires a desell maybe a mosonlight bac maybe
5342,they it's going to from the d cell to the light bulb wasn't making the light bulbs light and then coming back into the d cell,that it's going from the dead so to the light bubs and making the light bobs light and then coming back into the deep sell
5343,it's flowing to the d cell and both the light bulbs,it's flowing throgh the deesell and both the light bulbs
5344,the one d cell can be used about many things that one that one time,that one desop can be used to pall many things at  at one time
5345,that they all in the ciruit and they all do upon a jam in the ciruit,that they all all in the curcet and they all dou pull a job in the curcet
5346,it gets it gets less bright,it gets it gets less blight
5347,one pathway going from the d cell to the light bulbs,one pathway going fom the desell to the light bobs
5348,take more energy from the d cell,take more and ill gef from the d sell
5349,good,good
5350,well they both have two batteries now and so have one and though pretty bright,well um they both have two bad les now instead of one and tee pretty biht
5351,it's a little light bulb and it's showing it's has two batteries it's has two batteries and one light bulb but it's little deep bright,it's it's a light l li pol and its shilling t's  has too bad to eas a it's dits h it has to bad reasons ony wie one liebol but it's littlly bblight
5352,some showed on pathway of electricity and some have their own pathway of electricity,some sho on pathway  watccity and some have yo own pathway btletricity
5353,okay,oky
5354,the light bulbs become brighter,te light hopes become bitale
5355,pathway's,pathways
5356,because one battery is lighting two light bulbs yup it's great and the electric bulb and that we think so we are,because one bad is riting two liht wops yusqte and the locy by and everything so yeah
5357,the top ones on showing the same pathway the electricity,the top ones an't showing the same path way but let tristity
5358,well it's coming out of the side and going back into their d cell,bull it's coming out of the side and going back into the dsal
5359,it has it's own pathway,it has its own pathway
5360,the top ones,the top ones
5361,that those showing the same flow,that thoh showing the same flow
5362,well the bottom is the both the the top ones by but the bottom line is a pathway the top ones have though own pathway,well the bottom is really dim that both the the umtop ones are bight but the bottom on is shilling a pathway the top one the top ones have the on pathway
5363,up one because the more brighter so you can see better,up whens because them i'lle bridle so you can you can see better
5364,well some show the same the pathway and some don't but if they show the same pathway they won't be asked bright,well some show the same pathway and some don't but if they show the same pathway they won't be as blight
5365,well the silly circuit it would the light bulb should would be dim but in a that was so good the light bulbs would be light,we e silly surcat it would theat lght bubs would be dim but in a pilpiao surcet te lght bubs would be the light
5366,they both are using the same pathway,zilld they both all using the same pathway
5367,it's flowing and from the bottom of the lighht bulb,f it's flowing in from the bottom of the of the balippol
5368,that the top one is showing that it's not showing a pathway in the bottom one that showing a pathway then top one is bright and the one is dim,that the top one is showing is not showing a pathay in the botom wone a showing a pathway ha top one is bright in the bottom when one is dam
5369,well it's showing energy from a light bulb from the other light bulb,will its shi its sheling annergy from a lipe bo from the other lip bob
5370,well it's a going out of that the negative side going into both the batteries and then coming back into the d cell,well it's going ut of of the negitiveside going into los thebattes and then coming back into the de sell
5371,ah umm the top two they would be the best,um the the top to they would be the best
5372,they both are using the same pathway,they both  they both sausing the same pathway
5373,well it's showing the same it's showing the same the same pathway so though not going to get much electricity into them,well it's showing the same it's showing the same pathway so ten i can't get as much as aactrissity into them
5374,well the tube light bulbs were showing the same pathway of energy and they won't be as bright that by it,well the two like bobs are shoing the same pathway  anagy and they won't be as bright that way
5375,well the top ones are bright the bottom one is not so bright and but like the bottom one is showing a pathway what just to it the top ones out,well the top on so ihte the bottle one is not so bit and but like the bottlon is shoing a path wavol at chisty the top ones olved
5376,well the flow they should the same flow so they repels was going to be as light,well the flot they shoud the same flow so the lih bogs on int be as light
5377,the series circuits impel good,theye're silly cirkets and pilpil el sagets
5378,energy,anegy
5379,bye mornie,bimonin
5380,they give the light bulb energy,they give the light boll bannagy
5381,the negative side,the neggotive side
5382,it lights up,it lights up
5383,electricity,eletrissity
5384,it takes the it takes the energy all though electricity from the battery in it ended though and it like mix the light bulb light,it takes the it takes the anigy lectricity from the badly and it tand the and it like makes the liheld light
5385,it gives the energy to the light bulb,it gives p it gives the anigy to the vipbolb
5386,it wouldn't give it any electricity because though can be any going out into the positive side of the d cell,it wouldn't give it any ectrisity becaus there couldn't be any going out into the positive side of the desell
5387,they light up if it has a source of energy,they they lite up if it has a source forf anilgy
5388,the negative,the neggutive
5389,a battery wires and then light bulb,a badly wires and anlipol
5390,that the d cell gives like if wires are connected to it and the wires are connected to the light bulb it gives it like energy to make the light bulb light,that the dsall gives lke if the wises are connected to it cn an the wivses are connected to the lippol it gives it um u like anegy to make the ip po light
5391,if though connected to the d cell they transfer the energy to the light bulb,if theyr conected to the deso they trangefor the anilgy to the le bob
5392,the power comes from the negative and it goes to the light bulb and comes through the positive,the the power comes from the neggutive and it goes tothe vibol and comes to the pousitive
5393,a battery,a badly
5394,it goes toward with the side of the light bulb and it goes up to the filament and it goes down it goes keep going forward then it goes to the positive side,it goes tards the side of the vippolb and it goes up to the fillement and it goes there it goes um tit goes keeps going forward and it then it goes to the positive side
5395,it's the source that gives us the light bulb energy,it's the soulce that gives the um mypol bannag
5396,energy,ennegy
5397,both of the wire those one wire going from the bottom and those one wire going from the side,bo both of the wi therse one wire going from the bottom ind tos one while going from the side
5398,how do make a light bulb light,how do make a lihel bl
5399,the battery turned and now its going the opposite way and like its going into different direction all in though the light bulb is still lighting,the battl e turned and now it's going the opposite way an and like it's going in  different direction now in thethe lyppor was still lighting
5400,good,good
5401,the d cell is giving the light bulb energy through the wires,the desais giving tthe a light il bum and il ga through the wiles
5402,the light bulb now lead up want to changes to the side,the vipl now litd up when i changed it to the side
5403,it means that it will recieves but it will recieves the energy from the d cell,it means that it recves thet iit receves that ennergy from the desa
5404,okay,ok
5405,it moves the opposite way,it moves the opposite way
5406,yup,youp
5407,its flowing all in one direction to the light because the positive side is going through the battery into the negative side,it's flowing all in one durection to the light because becausethe um plus the positive side is going clu the badly into the neigutive side
5408,it's to the left and like center to the left and so it connected to the metal pole it won't the motor won't move so that means the switch is making it off,it's it's to the left and um like senc its to the left ind its not conected to the metal pudle it won't the motal won't move so that means the swish is making it off
5409,the motor is moving,the moter was moving
5410,the solar panel was giving it electricity to d cell can move,the sopandas um giving it o it justy so wet can move
5411,its sunny all in the solar panel is giving the electricty to the motor,its suno and a soll panda is giving trissity to the motale
5412,it doesn't move,it doesn't move
5413,it doesn't give electricity to get it doesn't give electricity,it doesn't give it a lettrty to gi toit doesn't gve it a lettristy
5414,the motor starts moving,the moale starts moving
5415,that is that its off i think it means that is off,that it's u that the du it's that's it's affi think it means that it's al
5416,makes the motor move,makes the mottale move
5417,the motor starts running,the motle starts running
5418,no i do not,no i do not
5419,they the sun come if the sun is shining on them it gives the electricity to all those things,they um the sun come if  sun is shining on it it gives a letsorf stad  tell other things
5420,we have been learning about motors and wires and when they connect the motor moves and we think,we've been arning learning about motles and wiles and when they conect the motale moves and everthink
5421,now the electricity goes into the motor because it's not travelling through the metal and it is make the motor run,no eletrisity gos into the motl because not traveling through the meddale and it doesn't make the motale un
5422,it gives the solar panel electricity to give it to the motor so it moves so the motor runs and moves,it gives a soull pandas agut chsity to give it to the motale so it moves so the motale runs int moves
5423,the motor is working,the moter as walking
5424,bye mornie,burmony
5425,open,open
5426,the flag is moving and its important because that means the motor is working and its moving,the flag is moving and it's important because that means the motale is wolking and its moving
5427,the switch needs to be closed,the swish needs to be closed
5428,those two wires connected to the part even negative side of the d cell and its making the motor moves,the s two witers connected to the potive and neigutive site of the disa and making the moale move
5429,that it turns to the sun shine untill that just being gives the electricity to all those things,that it turns to the sun shine into alectrisity and gives thelectrisity to other things
5430,i will no electricity would come through it because at there was no sun on it make a interval electricity,it wno let city would come through it because it ds no son on it to make it into alectrisity
5431,its in the close position,it's in the closed position
5432,those are electricity going into it,there was a lettristity going into it
5433,the track giving the electricity to move,d it's not giving it leca lectriscity to move
5434,so that ended the positive side of the d cell that while is going through the metal connecting to the other side of the wire is going to the motor and that's giving the power,so that ind the positive side the dec that wile is going through the medal conecting to the other side of the wilenit's going to the motl and that's giving a bowel
5435,the motor starts moving,the motal starts moving
5436,it showing that the d cell is giving the motor electricity so the motor moves,it's showing that the desall is giving the motal lectrisity so the mottale moves
5437,the motor starts moving,the mole starts moving
5438,the solar panel has to get sunshine,the sholle pandel has to get sunshine
5439,magnet,gted
5440,the switch has to be on,the swish ha o ar
5441,the flag moves,the flacnes
5442,well if sun is sharing the cell then its working but when it goes off there is no work and the flag will,we i in of chating the s itwas niei mor but when it gos then t we wor and the flwor
5443,the electricity will go through the d cell and it will turn on the flag,electricity won't go tho the dasell and it wiln't turnle the flag
5444,the d cells electricity makes the flag move,i do s  citty makes a fag
5445,the electricity goes through the wires and until it's cell and then it goes interact when will contraction and then it makes the flag move,te justiy gos through the wiers and int i soand then it goes into that little  choc o  than i makes the flag hoerun
5446,it makes the flag move,that makes the flag move
5447,no nail,no
5448,and electricity go through the two wires to make a flag move because the flag is metal on both sides so the metal touches that it turns on make through electricity,vanyuan yee wi w e nt in te t wiere so thel l  because the flag is in medal on both sides so en metal touches it it turns jatrnd ro to the
5449,the cell has behind the sun and then the wires connect all the way to the contraction and then make reflective so electricity goes through the few thing over and over and over,the sowl has to be hang a sun and then the wiers and te all the way to the antracton ans that make the fla move so u lik your sa gos ver the ol thing over and over and over
5450,it's on the metal where the wire is so it doesn't count all the way but it goes on like so there just it is electricity pass there so they was on top what a pretty as much electricity,it's on the meddl where the wier is so it doesn't goall the way but it gos on like halfway so tju citing faster so that et was on top t would't ta o   ci itristi
5451,the electricity going through,that you  io to be sing oro
5452,because they didn't then it what if work as well as a it's down so while we its dark anything outside will not work,because it did 't then it wouldn't work as wel as it is now so iit's dark and it's out side  not r
5453,it's not going to till because the switches off and it's not creating a circuit to make the flag move,it did not ga t g ta i because the wnc is off and it's not acree on the sircet to make a pi an
5454,no,ta
5455,it's not touching metal so where electricity won't go to the flag and it will make a circuit,it's nod tuching a medal so we alectriscity won't go to the flags and it will make a circu
5456,because the d cell has electricity in it so when then two connecters connect to the metal find on both sides as the switch touches metal then it will start working and create and put it would electricity to the flag,cause the de sell has e lectrisity in it so in the two conectors connect to the medtal flag on both sides and the switch tuch his mettal in the start wor creat and  eao just nikto the flag
5457,the d cell is at a circuit,the disa isn't a treitit the aagnic s
5458,those are also that electricity so when you put two wires on they and put a set to a d cell and putting into sun then vibrating to be like that electricity going through that cell,ts not also abot e tisitys so hen he put two eyes  an ad rty sa tty sno and tu it in the sun ybrting te hio e  dins yealo cist on thrugthat s
5459,it has to be on the metal,ind has to be on the meddol
5460,we've has been creating circuit,leave aating a sort get
5461,then it doesn't work,then it is r
5462,that when i touch it it moves and then i touch it again it moves off the circuit so it will produce the electricity but won't does touch the metal and produces electricity,that when i touch it it moves and ne when i tach it again it moves of ylthe scirc so it will eyou se hi just s at whe it dos touch the middle it pretty  cery
5463,because when the wire fix the d cell and other electricity doesn't like contracted like they contracted too,cause we wont  e wire it's liyaround the a  like youre citing on a icargin make o the turchiwork
5464,the flag moves,the flag moves
5465,it wouldn't work because that's be semi and mike has been getting it,a wato cre causi as be sunday a wight hay kiy
5466,electricity is going through it to make it move,e tesi is going tuit an i get a n room
5467,the d cell and the electricity,the deco and the latri
5468,the d cell has to be attracted two wires to go through the electricity to get to the move,eo has to be att  an to go i  to go witealemtricity to get te
5469,the flag stops moving because it does the sunlight and it is have electricity between the wires,the fly stops in the band because it  t does a o l and it oes a heavy lt which wi w
5470,no metal is put touching those two wires and like that and connect still just ready to get the,o meddli  tuch  r to the y so    cae tat it wl just ing to get   go py
5471,i talk to you later bye,'ll talk to later b
5472,you're separate no and there its it's like we better so yeah,jus oput a neil in there  t's it's like way better so yeh
5473,i don't know,i don't know
5474,its flowing through electricity,etx flowing through electrisity
5475,electricity is going through it okay,eles e citty is going thoughit ok
5476,and finnaly met before,i'm fine we've met before
5477,we've been learning science you can talking to me about it,we've been learning science ever since yu ben talking to me about it
5478,your down,you'r done
5479,because there not metal like all the other once,cause the're not medle like all the other ones
5480,it works because it's a metal,it works bcause it's a meddal
5481,we seen each other before,we've seen each other before
5482,just draw the tape the spiral that rock in stuff are all insulators but a other stuff is conductors,to straw the tape the spunge the rock and stuff are all insilaters but it al thugh other stuff is conductors
5483,one the metal is touching the switch so i already know that,shing this won um the metnal is toutching the swish so outed inthe b
5484,the nail,the nail
5485,metal is something if something's metal then and it sticks to something all sides metal then it would work and it would complete conductor,medal its something if something smedal then in it sticks to something else that's medal than it would work and it would compleat a conductor
5486,because the switch is metal so that's metal so it's make in a work,cause the swish is mettal so tat's mettal so it's makin it work
5487,insulators are some stuff that's not metal but conductors are things are metal that makes just sitting,inthelaters are some stuff that's not middle but um conductors are things that armiddle that makes asity
5488,it's not going because if that's not metal then work,it's not going cause if that's not medtale than it won't work
5489,i don't know can you repeat that please,i don't know can you repeat that pleas
5490,electricity is going to through the nail,it tsti is going throughwith a nail
5491,its open,it's open
5492,all the objects will not make electricity go,all the objects will not make elect just i to go
5493,yeah i'm good how are you i know you we met before but no i don't want to meet you,y good how are you i know we'vevent before bu oh i dnt wat t meat you i
5494,because the switches off and it's creating a circuit electricity all away to that motor,cause the swish is aoff and it's creating a circet and electrisity all a way to that nanortanig motor
5495,the flag is been moving because the d cell has to be,the flag is it moving cause the de so hus to we hked up to the wih
5496,when i click the switch and it goes on the metal it works and goes to the motor circuit it create electricity over that it is on it won't work,when i click the swich and it goes on the middle it works and tgoes to the motor so it cou creat alectrisity but when n it is on it won't work
5497,the cell is hitting the motor so when the cell hits the motor the wires it always to that cell and that it's start working,the sun is hitting the motor so when the sun hits the motor the wires hid all tway to the sell and then it jus starts work
5498,it will stop working because it's not creating electricity,it will stop workging because it's alot fcreating ait's just
5499,it is having the electricity going to the motor make a flag move,is have an electriscity going to the maer and make in a  flag mov
5500,it doesn't work,it doesn't wor
5501,it works,it works
5502,it doesn't work,it doesn't work
5503,we've been learning about circuits,we've been learning about circets
5504,because if it doesn't have if the sun has to hit that little contraction there then it will work,cause if it doesn't hit if the un doesnt hit that little ratchin there thet it won't work
5505,when you click on the cell its starts working will a stops working,whait when you click on the sn it start to working but what is a cloudy day ta stop o work kiting
5506,let the switch has to be off,lut the swish has to me offf
5507,the d cell is put does the electricity all away to the motor and making the flag move,the desall is producing electricitty al the way to the mter and making the flag mov
5508,no,though
5509,and till,you to
5510,the cell is hitting the motor and the motor set up the two wires all the way to the cell so while though that cell does hitting it it starts working,the sun is hitting the motor and the moter ooks up the two wires all the way to the sell so when the thesun is hitting it it it starts working
5511,what,what
5512,it doesn't work,it doesn't what
5513,the flag moves,the flag moves
5514,it doesn't work,it doesn't what
5515,electricity,teiy
5516,that put does the electricity,tha producing elotri
5517,it's creating a circuit that makes the motor run and makes the flag move,it's creating f sticken that make the moter run and mik the flag moove
5518,that it runs when the flag moves because the cell is gain electricity from the sun that two wires are hitting the motor so was the two wires make electricity to the motor then the flag move,s hat it runs hen the flag moves because the sell is getting aics tisting from the sun the two waiters are hitting the moter so hen the when the two wire is making alectriity to the moterthen the flag move
5519,that it's off the d cell it's off this the metal so it won't move the flag,that it's off the desell is off the sthe meddal so it win't move the flag
5520,it makes it work,it makes it work
5521,it would because it's not really sunny,it wouldn't wore cause it's not really sunny
5522,okay,ok
5523,the cell has to be hitting it,the sun has to be hitting i
5524,good,good
5525,they make electricity go through,then make a lectrisity go through
5526,it wouldn't work,it wouldn't wor
5527,now its going the opposite way but its going same way but if was turned around they would be go in the opposite way,now it's going the opposite way but it's no going the same way but if it was turner n it would be go ing the oppositewa
5528,its going the different way its going like then positive side go in the negative side going these way so its going to the positive and negative side but even light bulb is must be one to the that's i but anyway its going the other,it's going the different way it's going like the dpositivf sites g in the neggutive site's ing this way so it's going trough the posit te neggotive side but even to thohe lie obic must be going through that side but anyway it's goingi goer
5529,light,right
5530,okay,ket
5531,than it would work because if it was just at the ba are the two bases of bulb around lights must go up the light bulb so i were work easier,then it wouldn't work because if it was just at the ba o the two baces of the ball then'twint i' work cause the wise was to go up the light bo so i will be york easier
5532,the two wires are connected to the negative and positvie side and then the negative goes to the side of the metal of light bulb and then positve side goes up in light bulbs are produces the electricity through the light bulb,the two wiors are conected to the neggutive ampositive side then the the neggutive goes to the side of the middle of the lie all in the the positive side gos up in i o so it produce is yell just y through the lie all
5533,i'm good,good
5534,the electricity,electristy
5535,two wires have to be connected to make a complete circuit,two wise have to be connected to a to make a complite serge
5536,it has to take a path when you collect it,hovs to make a path when you colect id
5537,complete circuits,compleat srcets
5538,it light up like in her on a lamp electricity goes through and it goes through up and then still make us back up,it likes te leng and her lon a lamp it le just to gos through and hinit gos up and then po make goes back
5539,both side,bothsi
5540,it as how you electricity was to wires,it has a have lectricity with two wires
5541,that there is like the electricity the light bulb,that there's always the electricity on tholit lik bon
5542,electricity,eletr citty
5543,its negative in positive side connected to light bulb,it's the negutive anpositivof size conecto i e lihball
5544,i noticed that the flip this that should i noticed that if you'd put put it to the not the negative side they will go up that way but the people on the positive side then you know go the same way that it was in the begin,i notice that if you fifit this thei notice that if youd u put it to the noneggtive side then it will go the opposite way but if you put it on the posit upside the note go the same way that it was in the begi
5545,its flowing throught the light bulb and to the positive side,it's floting threwgh theelipb into the positers sad
5546,electricity,e lectricity
5547,if the circuit,it's a s
5548,do you think electricity,do thing you liks yus s
5549,the two wires are connected and the metal is touching,that two wires are conected and the meddal is toching
5550,they see a later,i see a later
5551,battery light bulb and wire,battery like bulb in wir
5552,i don't know,i don't know
5553,the negative,the negg
5554,electricity,electricity
5555,that they can conncet to each of them but if there if the two wires both at the base of the side of the light bulb it going to light up has it doesn't know,that they can connect t each of them but if they wre if tho two eyres were both at the bace af the side of the lo ball it wouldn't lighe up as it does now
5556,the ply is that it has to be touching metal with the two wires as we touching the light bulb then order of two,the point is that it has t  be touching meddle with the two wires has to be touching te light boin order for to let i
5557,the really through the wires into the light bulb back into the one positive,through it threwgh the wires into the lihe ball back into the posit and
5558,yeah,yeahh
5559,like if everybody got the same answer it might've taken a longer time to test out this experiment,like if everybody got the same answer it might have taken e longer time to test opt this experiment
5560,well um that's just kind of how she told us to set it up,well oh the ust kind of pa she told us t
5561,like if i said if i was going one two three and i was doing it like maybe by myself then um i may've miscounted one and that would mess up the whole experiment,like if i said if i was going one two three and i was doing it like maybe by myself then um i may have miss counted one  and that wen i sagh the hole i
5562,but it are you asking me like where it's set up,but  ar you asking me like where it's set up
5563,well if you like do it i guess if you kind of today uh we're gonna do it outside um,well if you like do it i guess if you kind of today i'l wor gong ot do it outside m
5564,n mmm as long it's as long a it's the string is tight and the plane is on mmm hmm,as long ant's as long a it the string is tight and that played is mm
5565,uh mmm cause i think we're gonna do one at a time mmm a ca and uh each table group is a different variable so that kinda covers it i guess we could try that,ucause i think wre gon d leni at time at  and o each table group is a different beriable so that kind it covers it i gues we could try wha any
5566,to if everyone was doing like the same variable it would take a longer time to do the experiment if everybody did the same variable and there's so many variables so i guess it's uh,t if everyone was doing like the same veriiable it would take a longer time to do the experiment if everybody did the same verible an there so many verible so i guess o ask eas w
5567,mmm hmm like um we have rubber bands and some people are gonna do like three rubber bands and they think that it'll be in less lines for the propeller,like um we have ever bans and some peabarkan i deo like three rubber mans and they think that it'll be an less lions for the prepeller
5568,yeah yeah mmm hmm i know,yeah yei know
5569,we're expecting it to um make like maybe a twenty maybe like in twenty spins for the propeller since the fan is helping it push maybe that'll help,worexspecting it to u make like maybe and twenty maybe un like and twenty spins for the prepeller since the fan is helping it push maybe that will help
5570,um like what do you mean,m right wein me
5571,sorry what,soy
5572,sorry um i guess to get different answers for each one,sr i guess to get different answers for each one
5573,yeah,yeah
5574,like,like
5575,then we wind it up and we test all of our variables,then we winded up and wen testi s
5576,we're gonna do that today though,wor couldn't do that sy ty o
5577,cause that will everybody wants a different answer,cause that wil everybody wants a different answer
5578,i'm kind of still wondering why it goes to the side and why the pennies just obviously we pu we tried to put it in the middle but then they like go to the side,i'm kind of still wondering why it goes to the side and why the penny is just nalvusly we puowe try t put i in the middle but then lt go to the side
5579,well i i wasn't here for yesterday like i told you so if they did science,well i i wasn't here for yesterday like i told you so if they did science
5580,the milliliters we had to see how much water could fit in our cup three centimeters,the millo leaters we had to see how much water could fit in her cup three seven eners
5581,five inches,five inches
5582,well um we w first of all everybody did a thirty eight centimeter wait no everybody did three centimeters of a cup and they cut off the rest,well um we  first of all everybody did at thirty eight sen meanteor e know everybody did three seen meanors of a cup and they cut off the rest
5583,um we did um how boats float,um we did um how boats flag
5584,a sandwich,a sandwich
5585,well i think this one can hold more water,well i think this son can hold more water
5586,one more time,or time
5587,that like the,that like the
5588,yeah,yah
5589,the height,the height
5590,i feel like a superstar like i already knew that no i'm kidding,fel like a super star inke already knew that non wi
5591,fifty s a hundred and three and fifty six,fifty st i and fifty six
5592,well it's basically the mass and how much the lifeboat boat can hold,well it's spacically the mass and how much the lifet ca boat can hold
5593,so this one holds more water so i'm guess well i'm not what i found out is it also holds more pennies as well and this one holds less water and it also holds less pennies,so this one holds more water so i'm guess wel g what i found thout was it also holds more pennies as well and this one holds less water and it also holds less pennies
5594,i can't really remember,i can't rally remember
5595,um good we got more than the ones that just stayed in the corner and started to sink to the side and,um good we got more thean the ones that justayed in the corner and started sank to the side and
5596,um well w there wasn't that many other than the height and the mass those were the only very big variables and we we didn't really do any more,um well there wasn't that many other than the hight in the mass those were the only very big veriables and we we didn't really do anymore
5597,yeah,ya
5598,maybe,maybe
5599,well this one holds more,well this one holds were
5600,is this thing on right,i ise on i
5601,oh um well i think the difference is that if you already have the pennies where you wanna place them then the mass is like um it's like not as big sorta,h um well i think the differences that if you areay have the pennies were yu one to place them then the mass is like um it's like not is pig started
5602,and we got it up to fifty,and we got it up to fifty
5603,is there like something i can hear myself in,is there like something i can hear myself inplod
5604,i guess the higher one might sink faster,i guess the higher one might sink faster
5605,well we we just placed the pennies in all different corners,well we we just place the penny is in all diffrent corners
5606,e i think i did it wrong because i think i started i think i started the right way but then i thought i had to do it down here so,i i think i did it wrong because i think i started i think i started the right way but then i thought i had to doi down here so
5607,i guess it if everybody would just go one two or one two three four the the whole thing wouldn't be like that anymore,i guess it if everybody would just go one two or one two three for the the whole thing wouldn't be like that anymore
5608,say that was twenty five and then for two fifteen i would i would i would probably end up,say that was twenty five and then fur two fifteen i woud i would d probly n
5609,um yes but um our teacher had us count all together like like i have shown you the whole cycle,um yes but um our teacher had us count all together like like i have showene you the hole sicle
5610,yes even the two hundred fifteen the hundred the ninety five the me,yes even the two hundred fifteen the hundred the ninety five the m
5611,sorry,
5612,mmm the two fifteen would make about,the teen fifteen would make about
5613,yeah,yehah
5614,yeah,yeah
5615,um i for the thirty eight or the different length,um u for the thirty eight or the different lengths
5616,the shorter swings uh swing more times than the um longer ones,the shorter swings a swing more times than the um longer ones
5617,you would probably get seventeen,yo oud probly get seventeen
5618,yeah,yeah
5619,yeah,yeah
5620,the numbers of the s your your swings and then these numbers are the number of your length,the numbers of the ygerswins and then these numbers are the number of your length
5621,and the the two hundred and fifteen string with the paper clip and a penny it got five,and the the two hundred and fifteen shing with a paper clip and the penny it got five
5622,so like the uh with one penny the two hundred and fifteen would still get five,so like the u with one penny the two hundrad fifteen wuld still get five
5623,yeah,yeah
5624,well we did try um i think two days ago uh everybody got a different um length and then she gave us the two more pennies and um that didn't seem to change,well we did try um i think two days ago uh everybody got a different um length and then she gave us the two more pennies and um that didn't seem to change
5625,and then,and then
5626,thirty eight,thirty eight
5627,you would you would find your length cause everybody got their own and you would first find yours so for mine,you wouyou would find your length cause everybody got their own and you would first find yours so for min
5628,um i guess we just i i don't really understand the question,um i guess we just ii don' l understand e question
5629,all the way up to twenty five and it was a graph like this,all theway up to twenty five and it was a grasf like this
5630,right right mmm hmm,rightrihtm
5631,or,or
5632,can i hear mys,ceway
5633,um sorry,thury
5634,that well the two hun and fifteen was dangling from here kinda just going like this and then mine was going,that well the two hundred and fiftn was stangling from here  just going like this and then mine was going
5635,how many swings you've gotten and then on this side you would write down your length and how many swings you got,how many swings you have gotten and then on this side you would rite down your length and how many sings you gott
5636,so if that was the length then,so of that was the length then
5637,yes,yes
5638,um we've been working with swingers um a pendulum,um we'e ben working with swingers um a pungilom
5639,like um our flip stick is a popsicle stick and there's six centimeters on it until these two come in so it's like one two three four five six,like m our  postick is the popcl stick and there's six sennimaters on it until these two come in so it's like one two three four five six
5640,cause that's the only way you can get your result,cause that's only waying get your result
5641,for each inch so like for six inches we did four times and then we divided it by four cause we did it four times and then we got our results,for each inch solect four six inches we did four times and then we divided it by four cause we didn't four times and then we got our results
5642,yeah yeah everybody does four trials on each centimeter,yeah everybody does four tryles on each centimeter
5643,oh oh we most of the time we make it hit to the like this part all the way down to the the next,h oh we most of the time we make it hit to the like this part all the way down to the the next
5644,twenty,twenty
5645,by four,by fore
5646,the more far it's out it go the aluminum ball goes higher as in like it uh that we're we're having a measuring tape and sometimes it goes higher than the limit,and ere fartsout it go the aloomin in baall gos higher as in like it uh that where were having a measuring tape and sometimes it goes higher than the limit
5647,yeah um like we kinda did two variables but it's coming together as one so we're seeing how far in or out the stick is and how it affects the ball,the yel um like we kind of to two verbls but it's coming together as one so wer cing how far in or out the stick is and how it fex the ball
5648,yeah,yeah
5649,it's like um it's how far the stick is so total the stick is total six inches so we keep pushing it in and in in more and more,it's like um it's how far the stick is so tourtle the stick is tortale six inches so we keep pushing it in and in and more and more
5650,well because the weight if it's like forty centimeters it'll definitely change everything but ten and twenty aren't that far away but if it was like forty from ten that would make a huge difference,el because the waight if it's like forty sevede meners itll defintly change everything but ten and twenty aren't that far away but if it was like forty from ten that would make a huge difference
5651,can i hear my,coul i hear wy
5652,um the screen the screen the marbles away from the water and the water away from the marble,um this grthis green fealterd the marbles away from the water and the water away from the marble
5653,the marbles have been separated from the water by using a filter,the marbles have been sepporated from the water by using a fil
5654,um you we call it a solution,um you be called to loosion

5667,they are a mix,they all ar mix
5668,okay um it's been taken apart and why that's important is it's not a mixture anymore,ok um it's been taken apart and why that's important is it's not a mixture anymor
5669,the salt it like disappears and goes into the molecules of the water,the sa it like disappeares and goes into the matar cues of the water and
5670,the salt will dissolve into the water and this type of mixture is called a solution,the salt will desolle into the water and this type of mixture is called a sualluc

6264,i found out that magnets stick to stuff,i found out thatmagnets stick to thes tuf
6265,i noticed that is sticks to the magnet,i noticed that it sticks to the bag net
6266,the nail thing is sticking on to the magnet,the snailiphin is sticking onto the magnet
6267,one is made of iron and one is steel and one is not,one is made of iorn an one war steal and one is not
6268,i think it is attracted to magnet because is made of iron or steel,i think it is e tractiagnet because it he's made of irn or stel
6269,is sticks,it sticks
6270,it may have iron or steel,it might have irn or steel
6271,it is made of iron maybe not,it is made of maybe not
6272,with you they are both made of iron or steel,t you they are boh made a irn esti
6273,the nail is made of iron or steel but woodblock isn't,the the l is made of irn or steel but the wood block isn't
6274,the motor is spinning,the motor is didding
6275,it is closed,it is closed
6276,these objects are metal,these objects are a meddal
6277,the insulators are not metal and they don't will not conduct electricity,the incelators are not medale and they don't not conduc electriity
6278,the popsicle stick is there and is not metal so the motor is not running,the pobsticle stick is there and it's not metal so the motor is not running
6279,insulators cannot conduct electricity and they are not metal need to be a metal,incelaters cannot conduct electrisity and they are not metal made of metal
6280,the motor stops,the motor stopp
6281,i think it's because the paper clip is metal,i think that at's because the paper clip is mettal
6282,conductors are always metal,um conductors are always medal
6283,the nail,the nail
6284,there is a wire a switch a nail a motor and a battery,thereis a wire a swish a nail um a motor ind a batterey
6285,we built circuits and we use solar panels to try to make a motor run,we built circets and we we used soller pandals to try to make a moter run
6286,the insulators are not metal but the conductors are,the incilators are not medl but the conductors are
6287,the motor it keeps spinning when the paperclip the open switch,the motor skeep pinning when the paper clip bridges the open switch
6288,bye,by
6289,okay,ok
6290,we've been working with circuits and batteries and solar panels,we've ben working with circuts and battres and soller panna
6291,i would say it is closed i would say it is open,i would say it is clo isay it is open
6292,good how are you,good how are you
6293,there are some objects,they are some objects
6294,it will i don't know,it wl o don't know
6295,it doesn't have the,it does not have the words show fe he
6296,when the switch is opened then no washers are on the magnet but when that is closed then other washers are,and when the swish is open then no washers are on the magnet but when the sitches closed then altomwashers are
6297,i can wrap i don't know,my tenrap i don't know
6298,they have to run,they have toout
6299,electricity has to go around a steel ring and it can pick up stuff,electriscity has to go around o stl thenge and a goodn picklstuff
6300,good,good
6301,when the switch is open the magnet can pick up any washers,when the swish is open the magnet can't pick up anywaters
6302,i told to you a billion times,i told you a billy an ti
6303,just roll around the steel rivet,just rll yu anain thest rat
6304,it turns into an electromagnet you can pick up metals,it turns into an eleptral magnut and can pick up mettals
6305,because the wire is wrapped around the rivet,u because the wire is rapped around the rimi
6306,electric electricity and a steel rivet make an electromagnet,lectric electricity and a stil river make a magn electral magn
6307,you have to have some electricity to make an electromagnet,you have to have um electriscity to make u elector magnet
6308,what,what
6309,it turns into a magnet,it turns into a mang
6310,the has to be made from steel,t has to be made from steel
6311,it is closed,it is closed
6312,i do not know,i do not know
6313,it's i don't know okay,it's i don' know ok
6314,it is closed,it is col
6315,the wires have to go around the rivet,the wires have to go around the rive
6316,the flow of electricity is control by the switch because the switch is opened that you can the electricity cant flow,the mpll electricity is controlld by the swish because the swish is open the you can't the electricityty you can't fl
6317,then it can be a magnet,that  can be a magne
6318,that means sometimes it can pick up stuff but sometimes it can't,that means sometimes it can pick up stuff but sometimes it can't
6319,there's lots of energy going through it,there's lots of energy going through it
6320,lots of energy is going through the steel rivet,lots of energy is going through the steel rivor
6321,the steel rivet can pick up many washers,the stel river can pick up many washears
6322,it means that it can pick up stuff,it meansight it it can pick up stuf
6323,i do not know,i do not know
6324,we've been seeing how rivet can pick up washer,wave an sn how ove ri river and pick up water
6325,it just starts,it just does
6326,there's one for each bulb,there's one for each bulb
6327,good,good
6328,the wires light up green,the wires lit up green
6329,um it's uh it's two bulbs and it's traveling through both of the wires and it's using electricity but if there was only one bulb the light would be brighter,um it's h it's to bulbs and it's traveling through both of the waiters and it's using ectrisity but if it was only one bull delight would be briter
6330,it's a lot dimmer,at's ot dier
6331,um the one on the right is brighter and the one on the left isn't brighter probably because of the formation,um the one on the right is brighter and one on the left isn't brighter probably because of the formation
6332,m it goes through the other side and it just keeps go traveling in a circuit for each side,it goes thouh the other side and it just keeps ging traveling i a circet for each side
6333,um it's brighter because it doesn't have to share with another electric a bulb,um it's brighter because it doesn't have to share with a mother lectrip a ball
6334,um they're the electric they're the symbol for the electric electricity traveling through things,um ther the electric ther ha semble for the electric electriscity traveling food thangs
6335,electricity,bing alectrisity
6336,um that it's not in the correct place where it could be traveling because of this one wire up here yeah i'm sure,um this ist not in the corect place where it could be traveling because this one miyer uppheare yaal
6337,um there's it's traveling through to separate sides and there's a bulb wires another bulb two more wires and a battery,um there's is traveling threugh two sepperit sides and there's a bullb wires another bull two more wires than the battery
6338,it's traveling through the wires and the bulbs,s traveling through the wires in the bops
6339,two bulbs and the electricity is traveling through two circuits,two bubs ind the lap  lectristy is traveling through two circets
6340,there's one d cell and two bulbs,there's one d stoon two bulbs
6341,um there's something in the way of the magnets um and that and you can only have two magnets in there i mean two washers in there before the magnet breaks down,um there's something in the way of the magnets um and that and you can only have two magnets in there i mean two washers in there before the magnet breake tits down
6342,um there's enough washers in the one side that it overpowers the force of the magnet,um there's enough wasers in the one side that it overpowers the fors the magnet
6343,um it's called magnetic field and it and opposites opposites attract and um the same det detracts,um it's called magnetic field and it in opposite  opposite tract in um the same detract detracts
6344,good,g
6345,blocks the magnetic field,blocks te magnetic field
6346,the magnetic field does,the magnetic field does
6347,um the magnetic field,m the magnetic field
6348,there's still a bit of magnetic field there but i don't think it's as strong as it was when it only had like a couple spacers,e're still a bit of magnantic fel there but i don't think it's as strong as it was when i only had like a couple spacers
6349,um i think it was nineteen magnets that was enough to take it had enough force to take away the power of the magnets,um i think it was nineteen magnets that was enough to take that had enough force to take away the powr of the magnets
6350,no,no
6351,m there's the there's the amount of a gi a bigger amount of washers and and that is really strong and it overpowers the magnet,um there's the theres  amount of giant a bigger amount of waters und and that is really strong and it overpowers the magnet
6352,um you already asked me that question,um yoreado aske me that question
6353,um they they still are trying to attract to each other but they just can't do it,um they they still are trying to atract to each other but they just can't do it
6354,working on magnets and water,bricking on magnets and water
6355,um the um washers ha er there's enough washers that it overpowers the magnet,um anthe the um waters ho ar there's enough waters that it overpowrs to bind it
6356,um there was so many um um washers that it the they overpower the magnet and the magnet couldn't um have more power,there wers so many umum wasers that ththey overpowered the magnetand the magnet coulhave more power
6357,um what's important is that it the more the wire wraps around the ribet rivet the more power it has to pick up the washers,um what's anmportant is that it the more the wire raps around the ribbit ribit the more power it has to pick up the washers
6358,it has to be a full circuit and the battery has to be fully charged and if it's not charged it can't be do anything and the switch has to be all the way shut,it has to be a full circut and the batter he has to be fully charged and if it's not carged a can't being do anything and the swish has to be all the way shut
6359,um well basically it's until the battery lun runs out or the switch is turned off,um well pacicaly untld the battery lunt runs out or the swish is turned off
6360,um it's the rivet,mer ribit
6361,see you later bye,e later by
6362,um the wire's wrapped around,um the wairs rapped around
6363,um i i've seen paper clips be temporar magnets yeah,um u i've seen paper clips be tempermer magnets ah
6364,um the battery is making electricity and it's going through and picking up all the washers,om the battery is making the chisiney and going through and picking up all the waters
6365,it's closed,it's closed
6366,studying electricity,studiing alectrisity
6367,or,or
6368,good,good
6369,it's the it it's like the magnet which picks up the washers,it's the mit it's like the magnet which picks up the waters
6370,yep,yup
6371,the switch has to be closed all the way so the electricity can make a full circuit and pick up the washers,the swish has to be closhed all the way so the lectristy can make a ful circet and pick up the washers
6372,um the electricity has to travel through to and it attracts things if it's a magnet,um the lectristy has to travel through tan i atracks things if it's a magnet
6373,it picks up the wa the electromagnet picks up the washers,it picks up the water the lectour magnet picks up the waters
6374,um probably because it gets enough electricity for just a couple uh small amount of time and then it just collapses,um probably because it gets enough electriscity for just a cu osmall amount of time and then it just lapses
6375,um the switch when when you turn it on it just activates the electricity and picks up all the washers,um and switch when when you turn it on it just activats  e lectrisity and picks up all the washers
6376,it's basically turning on the electricity,it's bacically turning on the electrissity
6377,um the electricity has to travel in a full circuit,um the lectristy has to travel in a full circet
6378,um it's an electromagnet and it's picking up all the washers cause it's really strong,um it's an electoral magnet and it's picking up all the waters cause it's really strong
6379,well electricity's powering it and it's just tol electricity that it's just like a magnet that can pick it up all the washers and iron and steel,well like trisiy's powering it and it's just told electrisity that it's just like a magnet that can pick it up all the watcher irn it stell
6380,well you have to think about the wire and then you have to make sure that the switch is already closed and that the wire wraps around a lot so it can pick up the washers,will you have to think about the wire and nat te make sure that the swish is aleady closed in the the wire raps around e lot so i cand pick up the washers
6381,um there's washers there's a d cell battery there's a wire a switch a holder and this steel rod,um there's washers there's a deesail battery there's a wire a swish a holder and this steel rod
6382,um the electromagnet picks up the washers,uhm the electora magnet picks up the wasers
6383,um i like cheese,um i cheese
6384,um a circuit electricity,um a circo of lectrisity
6385,electricity travels around,lectrisity travels around
6386,um it's a receiver and then it probably receives the electricity,mit's reciever and ten it probably recives the lectristity
6387,um studying magnetism,um study ind magnatisom
6388,um it's a it's ha it's like um circuit with electricity,um it's a it'ha it's like um circut with alectrisity
6389,um it's traveling through but but at the end it's cut off because the um the switch is away is away from the wire it's not by,um it's traveling through but but at the end it's cut off because oum the swish is away s away from the water it's not close
6390,there's a motor,ter's a motor
6391,um it travels through the wire and then it goes through and it goes through the motor and then the motor generates electricity and it charges the motor to move,um it travels through the water and then it goes o and it goes though the motor and then the moter genrates alectrisity and it tros the moter t move
6392,light bulb and the battery,like balb in the bete
6393,the motor the battery and the switch,the motor the battery in the switch
6394,um you put the lever down,um you'd put the lever down
6395,um the electricity comes to it,um the lectrcy comes to it
6396,it turns the electricity on and off,it turns to you a lectrisity on and off
6397,um it the m represents the magnet,wight the moter and the blines ones bigger than the other reppresents the battery and the swish reppresents the um the lion reppresents a squi
6398,um it's,um it's
6399,it let's them um electricity travel through properly,ut let's the mom look thristity travel through proper to
6400,um it's a battery and it has one positive side and one negative side,um it's a battery and it has one positive side mone neggoutive sid
6401,electricity which is like sort of magnetism,electriscity which is like sort of magnatisom
6402,electricity traveling through a circle,ellectristity traveling through a circle
6403,um the electricity makes a full circle through them,um the lectrisity makes a full circle through them
6404,um like a place where the electricity travels through like a tunnel,um like a place where the lectrissity traveld throg thik a tonnel
6405,um the electricity goes to the battery and through the wire and through the motor and it makes the when there's electricity going through the motor that makes it turn and it just goes in a circle,um the lectrisity goes to the battery and through the wier and through the motor and it makes the  there's a lectrisity going through the moter that makes it turn and it just goes in a circele
6406,a wire a light bulb um a battery a motor um a switch and the um boards basically,a wre a light bob um a battery amoter um a swish and theum board patically
6407,um it's one positive side and one negative side and it generates magnetism,um it's one posrve side and one neggutive sid in genorats magnatisom
6408,um the electricity goes through it and it makes the motor spin,um the lectriscity gos to it and it makes the motor spind
6409,the light bulb and the magnet,the light bob and the magnet
6410,um the wire,uhm the wir
6411,good,good
6412,um the electricity's traveling through the light bulb and n where it's cut off i think that's where the mate na magnetic field is sort of,um te electriscityes traveling through the lighebald and were it's cut off i think that's where the met n the magnetic field is sor of
6413,the electricity's traveling in a circle,he lectrisity traveling in a circle
6414,um well it's like if one goes out if one bulb goes out the other one doesn't go out but on another circuit if one bulb goes out the whole thing goes out,um well it's like if one goes out if one bull goes out daother one doesn't go out but onn another circle if one bub gos out the whol thing goes out
6415,not much,not much
6416,the uh electricity is traveling through and it's going through its separate pathway,the lectrisity is traveling through and is going through ceperit pathway
6417,it burns out,it burns out
6418,um i didn't say anything,um i didn't say anything
6419,um it has,hum it ha
6420,probably a parallel,probably a parelo
6421,there's two paths,theirs two paths
6422,the other one goes out,he other one goes out
6423,electricity is re resembled by blue traveling dots,lectristy is re resembled by blue traveling dots
6424,parallel circuit,purlle curcat
6425,um do you mean string of christmas lights,um do you mean string of chrismas lets
6426,i got that,i got that
6427,hi,high
6428,if on a parallel circuit it's each bulb has a separate thing,if aont a parelll circut it's each boll os a seprit thing
6429,not really,not really
6430,it's attracting things that are steel or um iron,it's attracting things that a're steel ore um irn
6431,you're welcome,welcom
6432,it attracts things well,it attracs things well
6433,i think that iron and steel are rock so it might be containing in that rock,oi think that irn and steels ar rock so it might i beat have a little containing in that roc
6434,m i think that um the magnets that stick together are in opposite sides and the ones that don't stick together are,um i think that um the magnets that stick together are on opposite sides and the ones that don't stick together are
6435,i see um some iron some steel some rocks um some wood plastic and a sponge,i see um some irn some steel some rocks um some wood plastic in a spunge
6436,we've been studying water and magnetism and things like that,we'e ben studying water and magnatisom and thinks like that
6437,um well they're usually like um some um mostly metal and yeah,um well theyre usually like um sm m mostly medal and yeh
6438,um the aluminum nail um does not have the material in it that sticks to the magnet and the steel nail does,um the loomnamnail uhm does not have the material init that sticks to the magnet and the stel nail does
6439,um magnets usually stick to iron or steel and,um magnets usually stickd to irn or steel and
6440,um it doesn't do any m it doesn't stick to any materials that aren't um steel or iron,um it doesn't do any mait doesn't stick to any materals that aren't um stl or irn
6441,um there's iron there's steel there's some rocks wood plastic copper and a sponge,um there's irn o'r stil there's some rocks wood plastic copper and a spunch
6442,an aluminum nail doesn't attract because it's um not really like the material that is supposed to go with the magnet,and alumirom theyall doesn't attract because it's um not really l the materal that supposed to go with the magnet
6443,um the st the steel nail um sticks to the magnet and the aluminum nail does not,um the sthe steel nail um sticks o the magnet and the louminat nail does not
6444,we,w
6445,um they attract the things are u that um are not the same as them and they don't attract the things that are the same as them,um they atract the things that are you that um are not the same as them and they don't attract tething things that are the same as the
6446,you asked me that but um it it sticks to iron and steel mostly,you askd me that but um it it sticks too irn and steel mostly
6447,it's a magnet that attracts it's um opposite and does not attract it's um same,it's a magnet that attracts its um opposite anddoes not attract its um cint
6448,light bulb and a magnet,a balb bit a magnet
6449,good,it
6450,nothing,nothing
6451,um they are the pathway of where the electricity travels through,um they are the pathway ofwer the lectriscity travels through
6452,it's a it symbols a light bulb on a battery,it's ah it cembles a light balbon a battery
6453,electricity,lectrisity
6454,thank you,thank you
6455,it receives the electricity,it receives e lectrisity
6456,it um is the source for electricity and it helps the electricity travel through the objects,it um its a source for lectrisity and it helps the lectrisity travel through the objects
6457,electricity that travels on a circuit,thrisit hat travels most circet
6458,it's the pathway over where the electricity travels through,it's the pathway over the lectristy travels through
6459,well just two light bulbs aren't as bright cause it has to travel through the light bulb twice but when it's one um has more power because then it only has to go through once and it's not as tired,and once ostwo like bobs aren't is bright bcause it has to travel through like bolb twice bu ons one um has more power because it only has to go through once andt not as tired
6460,electricity travels through a cir circle,llectrisity travel throgh a circircle
6461,um there's a battery a motor a switch a wire a light and a base,um there's a battery amoter a switch a wire a light and a beasc
6462,it's the main base of the electricity,it's the main bace of the electricity
6463,they the electricity comes to them,a dletrisity comes to them
6464,um electricity,um alectrisity
6465,um it's a circle where the electricity travels through,um it's a circle where the lectristy travel through
6466,it goes in a full circle when the switch is down when it's up it's cut off,it gos in a full circle when the switsh is down when it's up it's cut off
6467,it's a schematic and it shows the light bulb and the um battery,it's a scamattic and it shows the light bulb and the umbattry
6468,it cuts off the electricity so it can't run all the way through but when it's down and touching the other side it makes the electricity go in a full circuit,it cuts off the electriscity so it can't run all the way through but when it's down and touch on another side it makes electristy goh in a full circet
6469,um when it's closed it it it's it can travel in a full circle to get to the light bulb when it's but when it's open it's cut off,um when it's closed it it it's it can travel in a full circle to get to the light ball bnit sinbut when it's opened it's cut off
6470,it's the source of uh electricity,'s a source of lectrissity
6471,um they have a lot to do with electricity,um  they have a lot to do with a lectrisity
6472,motor,motor
6473,um it receives,um it recieves

6475,a switch a battery and a motor,a swish a battery in a moter
6476,electricity's traveling through and it goes past the motor and it tur and it causes the motor to spin,tristys traveling through and it goes past the motor and it tu it causes the moter to spend
6477,studying batteries and electricity,sturding batries am i tristy
6478,they're wires and electricity travels through them,the'r wires and electrisity trevels throughthem
6479,it um it makes the electricity travel in a circuit and spins the motor,it um it makes te lectrus thatye travelr on a circut and spends the moter
6480,um we've been studying magnetism and a little bit of water not really,um we've been studiing magnatisom and a little bit of water not really
6481,um they're um basically they're sort of a magnet and they're batteries,um there um bacically theyre sort of magnet and their batteries
6482,um it says receiver and i think it it like gets the light it attracts the light when the wa when the electricity is connected to it,um it says a recever and i think it it like gets the light it attracks the light when the winder  lectristity is connected toh it
6483,um the magnet the wire the light bulb and holder,um the magnet the wire the light boll bin teholder
6484,um a battery um a light bulb some wire and it looks like a holder i guess,um a battery um a lighte bolb and some wire and it looks like a holder i guess
6485,um the wire mmm the the part maybe where the electricity travels through,um the wire the te park maybe where the lectrissity travels through
6486,um energy i guess,mom energy i guess
6487,good,et
6488,that the grape mix the one the furthest to the line the closest to the line is more,that the grat mix the one the furthest to the line the closest to the line is more concent
6489,that the solution on the right will be heavier cause solution on the left only has ten grams of solute and the solution on the right has twenty grams of solute,that the sallution on the right will be heavier because seselution on the left only has ten grams of sellute in thi sllution on the right has twenty grams of sollute
6490,b,b
6491,our class has been working on a lot of things according to concentration,our class has been working on a lot of things according to concentration
6492,that the one on the right is heavier and yes yes i was right,that the one on the right is heavier and yes yes i was right boo y
6493,yes i am,yess i
6494,because of how much salt is in them or how much it weigh,because of how much sult is in them or how much itwe
6495,it helps us measure how how concentrated our solutions are or mixtures or solvents or just solute,measure it helps thus measure how concntrate it how concantrated our sallutions are por mixtures or solveence or just sllue
6496,well um,well d
6497,can you please repeat that,can you please repeat that
6498,one is the most concentrated solution,one is the most concntrated sallution
6499,if one way is more than the other that means it is more concentrator,if one waves more than the other that means it is more concentrater
6500,the rock is a lot heavier than the feather and it's weighing scale down more,the rock is a lot heavier than the feather and its wings tail down more
6501,can you please repeat,can you please repete
6502,one is the most concentrated and two is the least concentrated,one is the most consentrated and two is the least concentrat
6503,i wanna do,wat to do
6504,well if it,well if it
6505,i think solution one is the most concentrated and solution two is the least concentrated,i think sallution one is to most concentrated in seallution too is the least concentrate
6506,one has ten grams of solute and the other has only twenty grams of solute,di one has ten gramts of sollute and the other has only twenty grams of sollute
6507,some of them have layers others are just murky and mix some are settled some aren't,some of them have layrs other are just mirky and mixed some are settled some aren't

6510,studying chemical chemical weathering and,studying cemmical an kemical wethering and
6511,that the mountains have more gravel,that the mountains have more gravil
6512,because the delta has more sand and less gravel and the mountains has more gravel and less sand,brit because the dalta has more sand and less gravil and the mountains has more gravil and less sand
6513,the different soils were picked up from different water beds,the different soils were picked up from different river beds
6514,they all hold humus clay sand silt,they all hold chumits clay sand and salt
6515,that some have layers and some don't others others have humus and some don't,that some have layers and some don't others others have humis int some don't
6516,i notice that some are different from others because some have more sand and less clay other have more dirt and less sand,i notice that some are different from others because some have more sand and less clay others have more dirt and less sand
6517,deals with it,me dals with eit
6518,it's made of minerals like humus gravel clay sand and silt,t's made of minirls like humors grabble clay sand and salt
6519,because they come from different places the one that has more sand comes from a delta because a deltas deltas are usually at the bottom of the river and that's where all the rocks are grind up and turned into sand,because they come from different places the one that has more sand come from a buta because the dels els are usually at the bottom of the river and that's rll the sart rocks are grinded up and turnd into s
6520,there is humus gravel clay and silt inside the soil,there is humos gravvil clay and cilt inside the soil
6521,different minerals,different minerals
6522,not all soils are the same because some of them come from different places,not all soils are the same because some of them come from ither places
6523,it's soil,its soil
6524,they are similar because they all have a little of humus dirt sand and clay but some don't have as much as others,they are similer because they all have a little of humos dirt sand and clay but some don't have as much as others
6525,that they're that they all look different because they're from different places,that they re that they all lookd different because theydifferent place
6526,they were put into water,they were put into water
6527,it is called saturation,it is called sagration
6528,no because it is already dissolved into the solution i mean into the water,kno because it is already desolved into this sullution i mean into the wate
6529,one is a mixture the second one is a solution,one is a mixture the second one is a seallution
6530,called a mixture,called a mixture
6531,no,yet kno
6532,i don't know,i don't know
6533,the salt will get dissolved and it's important because some people think that the salt will just disappear and nothing will happen to the tot he solution but it will gain weight,thes sault wil get desolvs it's important because some people think that esalt will s disuppere and nothing will happen to the su to the sallution but it will gain wait
6534,i don't know,i don't know
6535,the mixture is being separated,the mixtures being seporated
6536,dissolves into the water and the water gains weight because of the salt even though you can't see the salt it's still there,desolves into the water and the water gains wait because of the salt even tough you can't see the salt it's still there
6537,they're important because now it is no longer a mixture they are just one's a solid a separate solid and ones a separate liquid,they are important because now it is no longer a mixture they are just on one solid a seprit solid and onts a seprit liqu
6538,some are solids and some are liquids,summer solids and summer licqu with liquids
6539,that the salt dissolved into the water unlike the sand and unlike the sand and water and the dirt and water,thet te salt desolved into the water unlike the sand in unlike the sand an water in the dirt in water
6540,they were being separated,they were being seporated
6541,there be they are being separated,they are bethey a're being sepporated
6542,some solutions can be separated,some sallutions can be suppar
6543,it is important because you are separating the mixture,it is important bbecause you are sepperating the mixture
6544,we have been learning about chemical and,we have been learning about cemicale and
6545,good,good
6546,it separated and aren't a mixture anymore,it' seporated and aren't a mixture anymore
6547,most of them are mixtures like the salad and the well two of three of them are mixtures the trails mix the salad and the wood chips with the paper clips,most of them are mixtures like the sallid and the well two of three of them are mixtures the trail mixs the soulid ind the woodchips with the paper clips
6548,the difference between a mixture and solution is a solution is something that gets mixed in with a liquid and a mixture is two solids,the difference between mixture and sllution is te sullution is something tht gis mixtin with a liquid and i mixmixture is to solids

6556,we're actually doing a lot of saturation and well we've been doing saturation with salt and epsom salt,we're actually doing a lot of saguration and um well weve bin do excaguration with salt and epsm salt
6557,the more concentrated one will sink to the bottom,the more concentrated one will sink to the bottom
6558,if an object is less dense and we drop it into a tank of water it will it won't sink and it will float the object will float,if an object is less dencs and we drop it into a tank of water it will it won't sink and it will flouat the object will flut

6566,that the less concentrated one will go to the top and then the least concentrated the oh my god okay,that the less concentrated one will go to the top and then the leas consentrate the migot ok
6567,the lighter solution in first other than putting the heavier solution in first,the lighter sallution ad first other than putting in the heavier sellution ant first
6568,the lighter salt solution will sink to the bottom or mix with the heavier salt solution,tthe lighter sault sullution will sink to the bottom or mix with the heavyer sault sellution
6569,that the more concentrated ones are at the bottom,that the more conscentrated ones ar ond the bottom
6570,this has to do with chemical reaction because the the reaction is it adds weight to the solution,tishas to do ithe caca reaction because the the reaction is it ads waigt to this suallution
6571,this evaporation result tells us that this solution can not be evaporate,this vaoration result tells us that this sallution can not be evapperat

6600,both brown the streaks are both brown but the minerals are different colors,both brown the streakes arbl brown but the minorals are different colors
6601,rocks,rocks
6602,really no maybe one is the sharpest mineral ever and the other one just looks like awesome,really know maybe one is the sharpest minneral ever and the other one just looks like awsome
6603,because minerals break in different way like mica breaks in like flakes and if you break topaz it'll probably break in little chunks,because minirals break in different ways like mika breakes in leke flakes and if you breake toe pas ittlle probaby you like break in little junks
6604,it tells us like how they break and it helps us identify them cause minerals break in different ways which i already said,it tells us like how they break and it helps o sidentifye them cause minirals break in different ways which i already said
6605,i don't know,i don't know
6606,a streak mark when you streak when you rub the mineral on a tile and whatever mark like whatever color mark it leaves it helps you identify the mineral,ting a streake mark when you streak when you rubb the miniral on a tile and would ever mark like whatever color mark it leaves helps to identifye the minra
6607,it's it leaves a scratch mark yeah,it it leaves to scratch mark yeah
6608,the fingernail scratches the mineral,the finger nail scratches the miniral
6609,we're showing the way that the you're showing the way that the mineral breaks,we're showing the way that the mnyou're showing the way that the midirall bler breaks
6610,it tells us its cleavage which shows us like how it breaks cause minerals break in different ways,it tells us it's cleavish which shows us like how it breaks cause minirals break in different ways

6650,that when you pour the sand in it mixes for a little bit and mixes with the water and then it settles but when you pour the salt in it just dissolves into the water,that when you pur the sand ind it mixes for a little bit and mixes with the water and then it settles but when you pur the salt in it just desolves into the water
6651,is basically the thing that the solute mixes into,roll is bacicaly the thing that soll use mixes into
6652,that it is ten grams and more colorful than everything else,that is ten grams and more colorsful than everything else

6666,we've been studying land forms,we've been studying land for
6667,it's showing how it's water is eroding away one spot and then it's the depositions ending up in the middle of the river and it's forming an alluvial fan,it's showing how it's water is a roting away one spot and then its the deposition is ending up in the middle of the river and it's forming it an alovial fan
6668,it's because it's showing that highlighted part is showing deposition in the stream table,kit's because it's showing that highlight i part is showing deposition in the thes stream table
6669,oh this is deposition,oh this is deposition
6670,it shows little movement because in the deposition area it shows little movement because the deposition is making like the river tinier and then it goes slower and yeah,it shows little movement because in the deposition area it shows little movement because the deposition is making like the river tinr and then it gos slower andyen
6671,by deposition and erosion,by deposition and erosion
6672,these are created by erosion,these are created by erousion
6673,when water's gone through it and eroded and eroded away all the rock to make a really big valley,when water as gone through it and roted and roted away all the rock to make a really big valley
6674,valleys are created by erosion which is tiny particles being taken off of something and then just floating away,vallies are created by erosion which is tiny particles being taken off of something and then just floating away
6675,that would mean that erosion was happening here,that would mean that erosion was happening here
6676,by i mean by erosion,by deposite i mean by erosion
6677,it's when particles when water washes away particle off of a big like rock and they float away it's called erosion,it's when particles when water washes away particles off oa big lig rock and they flot away it's called erogion
6678,deposition,deposition
6679,it's showing the erosion and deposition and yeah,it's showing the errosion and deposition and ya
6680,this is showing a valley that has probably been eroded away by water over millions of years,this is showing am a vallew that has probly been eroted away by water over y millions of years
6681,erosion,is erosion
6682,they are formed by water and with erosion and deposition and a river,they are formed by water n with erotion and deposition in a river
6683,erosion is the particles taken away from something as water flows by it because it's like eroding away and like yeah i really failed at this answer,e roson is the particles taken away from something as water flows by it because it's like it riding away in like ei really fil at this answer
6684,alluvial fan,alubiol fan
6685,i notice that there's lots of sand coming up and like it's the deposition and like i don't like doing this,i noticed that there's lots of sand coming up in like its the deposition and like i don't like doing t
6686,there is a lot more of spoonfuls of drink mix in the darker one than in the lighter one,there's a lot more of spoonfuls of drink mix in the darker one than in the lighter one
6687,taking out some water cause if you put three three spoonfuls in fifty m l of water to more concentrated otherwise if you put it in the hundred m l of water it's not as concentrated,taking out some water bcause if you put three sptsthree spon fuls in fifty ame of water s more concentrated otherwise if you put it in a hundred an amel of water it's not as contet concentrat

6698,you are making a solution,you are making a sallution
6699,taking water away from the solution,taking water away from the sullusion
6700,it depends if it's lighter or darker or weighs more than one another,it depends if it's lighter or darker or waives more than one another
6701,because of its color because the one that had three teaspoons is very dark the one that only has one teaspoon is very light,because of its collor because the one that has three teet spoons is very dark the one that onely has one te spoon is very light
6702,that they have put more solvent into it meaning they've put more solid or powder into into the liquid and it has now made a,that they have put more solvent into it meaning theyve put more solid or pouder intinto ze liquid and it has now made a sill
6703,to more solvent has been put into them,to more solvint has ben put in to them
6704,by either putting more spoonfuls in or taking some more water away,by either putting more sponefuls in or taking some more water away
6705,i notice that the more powder you put in like in the what the cup on the right the solution on the right on the left is darker and the one on the right is,i notice that the more pouder you put in like in the g cup on the right the sullution on the right on the left is darker and the one on the right is l
6706,because it's not as concentrated as the other cups,because it's not as consentrated as the other cups
6707,not as good because it doesn't have enough grape powder,not is good because it doesn't have enough great pouder
6708,that's because the solution is now saturated,it's because this sallution is now statturated
6709,it is because you have shake the solution and put more water in it til it saturate,it is because you have shaked this sallion and put more water in untill tsatgur
6710,what,h
6711,that it's because you have saturated the solution,that i's because you have cagurated the calloo
6712,haven't really been at school so i haven't really gotten to do science mostly but we have been doing a lot of saturation,i haven't really been at school so ven't really got i a dwo second mostly but we haven't do ing lot of sagurati
6713,i don't care blah,it's car blac
6714,one solution is heavier than the other,one sellucion is heavier than the other
6715,because you subtracted sixty seven from fifty i mean fifty from sixty seven,because you subtracted fi sixty seven from fifty i mean fifty from sixty seven
6716,hey i don't know please tell me,a y i don't know pease tell me
6717,have to do with saturation,have to do with saguration
6718,you are trying to saturate the solution can she even hear me hello okay she can hear me,you are trying to sad treate these sullutionchievean heare me  oka   ca
6719,that the that the other solution has to weigh sixty seven grams,at the at the other sallon has to weig sixte seven grams
6720,that's because the the solution has salt in it it weighs more than just a cup,that's because the ate sillution has salted it and waives more than just a cup
6721,it happened because the water slipped into a crack then froze and broke the rest of the part i mean rest of the rock apart,it happened because the water slipped into a crack then frose and broke the rest of the part i mean rest of the rock ap
6722,we have been studying chemical and and physical weathering,we have been studying cemicl and in fhisical weatherin
6723,wait what,wea
6724,i observed that the water is breaking the glass because it has no where to go when it's being frozen,abserved that the water is breaking the glass because it has no where to go when it's being frozen
6725,that the farther up the rocks are in a stream the bigger they are,at the farther up the rock start in ha stream the bigger they are
6726,abrasion and stuff is like that,abrasion and stuff is like that
6727,that some are bigger because they're at the top of the stream and haven't gotten worn down the other ones at the bottom of the stream are smaller cause they have gotten worn down,that som are bigger because they art the top of the stream and haven't gotn worn down the other ones at the bottom of thi stream are smaller because they have gotn born down
6728,has to do with physical weathering because the water that has frozen into the rock is breaking the rock apart,t has to do with pisical wontering because the water that has frozen into the rock is breaking the rock apart
6729,it expands,it expand
6730,it expands,dot it expands
6731,tree roots are growing into the rock and breaking it apart,three roots are growing into the rock and breaking it a part and breaking it apart
6732,good,good
6733,water is gotten into the cracks of a rock and it has frozen it is making bigger cracks in the rock almost breaking it apart,water is goten into the cracks of a rock and it has folen and is making bigger cracks in the rock almost breaking it a part
6734,the rocks at the bottom of the of the stream have been weathered have been weathered the most because they are the tiniest,the rocks at the bottom of the lthe scream have been wate  have been weathered the most because they are the tinye

7175,it doesn't show red over the blue ball,it doesn't snow red over the blue b
7176,yeah the color of the light that's shining out of the filtered paper the other object would turn that color too,he had the color of the light thats shining out of the filltered paper would the other objects wicturn thert colar to
7177,uhm it will just just be black,um it will just just be black
7178,well it is the same because it is one reflecting the color of what the ball color is and it's not the same because the yellow ball isn't showing blue light it's only showing yellow and the blue ball's not showing yellow light it's only showing blue,well it s the same because it is one reflecting the collor of what the ball collor is and it's not the same because the yellow bal isn't showing blue light it's only sholing yellow in the blue balls not showing yellow light it's only yong blue
7179,red,red

7367,the baking soda is all away down to the cup,the bangking coticed all away down to the carb
7368,saturated,agurated
7369,baking soda,like and so ta
7370,tasty,piin
7371,this vinegar and then its baking soda and then it became saturated and then it's still fizzing,there's vinigar and that it's um bigin sota and then egg became saturated and thend it's still zzyi
7372,learning about ah umm,running about um
7373,just you could have said is and six white gram sixty seven grams,jusicet ast is se mo a six small white gram sixty seven grams
7374,it's getting more saturated,it's get more sagurated
7375,because you have to wait and see how much it was because everyone secrets has survey sixty seven epson salt,because you have to wait and cama ship weigs cause everyone sicats hase wy sixty seven epents already
7376,yeah,y
7377,it's getting more saturated and saturated,it's geting more sagurate on sugrated
7378,no,
7379,getting saturated,thing sagurated
7380,they have dissolved different times and it takes longer for to dissolve and the saturated this sugar difference in all the others,they all desolved different times an it takes longer for each want to deslve and they sch assurer is thicker than all the others
7381,so the one on the left has all those,so the one on the left has all those oomon
7382,it is dissolving and an never comes back,it jast a fall fing and it never comes back
7383,think the jelly beans on the left is called a mixture and one on the rigth are not mixture at all,ing the jaly beings on the left is called a mixture and the ones on the right are not mixtured at al
7384,it changed because you put him you,be changed because you b put im y
7385,the,doso
7386,so you mix water any put and now open the and you pour it in the water change out put some marble stay,oh you' mixed the marble with water cand you put a net over the boll and you pore it in the water grains out but them marble stay
7387,it is dissolving into other things,it wis devoling into alther things
7388,it is dissolving,it is tevallve thing
7389,that the when the salt when you pour water in the salt it disappears and not disclosing make sure but you don't know it just looks like clean water in that in the water looks like get started,that the when the salt when you poore water in the salt it disappeares and that's called tit mixture but you don't know it just looks like plan water in the dirt in the water looks like that the dirt didn't get sdart up
7390,no because it is mixed in there and when you drink it he does not come out,no because it is mixed in there and when you drink it it does not come out
7391,it is the different mixture because it is dissolving and to a different thing with the motor,you knew so different mixture because it was ta bollving into a different thing with the gravil in water
7392,it is dissolving into other things,it des dosolving into other things
7393,it has separated and the,it has sepeoratedand the
7394,the,that
7395,i've been learning about mixtures,i've been learning about mixtures
7396,its not mixture anymore,it's not mixtured anymore
7397,it was mixture but now you have separated everything there is only one is mixture,it was mixtured but now you have sepprated everything to wear there was only one pile that is mixtured
7398,good bye,goodbye
7399,it's important because its important because the sand state in the filter and water went down,it's important because it's important because the sand stayd in the filter and the water went down
7400,the solid is different because it is more healthy then jelly beans jelly beans i can't,the solid is a different because it is more healthy than jeallybeans and jellybeans are candy
7401,good how are you,good howre y
7402,that when you pour water and the salt it exhaust and disappears,that when you poure water in te sault it desolves and disappeares
7403,yes,yes
7404,to dissolving into other things like material,t devolving into other things ik material
7405,that it has treated from being a mixture,that it has reaited from being a mixture
7406,its called dissolving,et's calld divolving
7407,it is something otherwise that will never come back,it is something otherwise that will never come back
7408,i'm put the sand and you pour the water sand in there and all the water turned out in the sand the filtered was in the filter,i put the sand and you pore the water sandin there in the all the water traine out and the sand the dirt was in the filder
7409,well it looks like it looks like that there was,bull it looks like it looks like that there as
7410,its importnat because we are separating the stuff and because so we know what mixture,it's important because we are seporating the stuff and because so we know what mixtures
7411,that when two are more things are put together its called a mixture,that when two or more things irre put together it's called a mixture
7412,and use there is no way the you think it get back,is divalzing ling andyouh there's no way that you can get it back
7413,thank you for asking,thankyou or aski
7414,about yeast wheat and and that's it,e wile yeutet and and that's the

7462,a salt is coming back,a saw is coming back
7463,a solution,a sallout s
7464,that the take the those salt is has a go,the te tht the result is hasical
7465,it is a bigger group of mixture,it is a bigger group of mixture
7466,i noticed that when you put the salt,i noticed that when you pore thi sol
7467,that is all mixture it is called a solution,that is all mixture and it's called a sullution
7468,that when you put it together it's called a mixture and then you take it apart it is called a solution,that when you put it together it's called a mixture and when yo take it a part it is called a sallution
7469,salt disappeared and it is important because you tried to get back put you can not come back into you put it in the sun for about three hundred and eighty four days and it comes back in the water is gone,sall dust appeared and it itis important because you try to get it back but it cannot come back until you put it in the sun for about three or four days and it comes back wan the water is gone
7470,that the solvent when you pour water into salt it does pour in that means it called dissolving,that the salt when you por water into  salt it disapperes in that means it's called devollving
7471,you pour the in the water and instead up in becomes put that,you por the dirt in the water and you start it up and int becomes bt dirt
7472,the powder is going to water in yesterday and it looks like wet then,the pouder is going to the water and you stere it and it looks like wet th
7473,that great powder,the greope pouder
7474,it's a mixture,it's a mixture
7475,it is a solution,it is a sallution
7476,good,good
7477,it's a mixture,it's a mixture
7478,a mix a solution,a m sllution
7479,you put in the sun in dissolves and then it comes back and then you pour water into it and instead backup and it dissappears and the mixture,you put it in the sun and it desolves and then it comes back and then you pore water into it and you star it back up and it dissappears in ts a mixture
7480,this is not a mixture,this is nt a mixture
7481,i've been learning sureprise mixtures and out they dissolve and,i've ben learning so far as mixtures and oter they desolved
7482,so you poured salt in a empty cup in a plate,so you pored sallt in an empty cup and yu put
7483,that it might be two hours and that it could be,that it might be two hours and that it could be here now and then
7484,it's a mixture,it's a mixt
7485,yes is called it dissolving,yes it is called in divulving
7486,you are pouring salt into the water in history and it disappears and it solution and it's a mixture,you are poring the sult into the water an you sture it and it disappeares and it's a sallution and it's a mixture
7487,a solution,n a sallution
7488,it is mixture of,it is mixtured of
7489,have a mix it and you have,yu have a sand in water you mix  it any
7490,the salt disappears and the water it looks like regular water,te salt disappeares and the water it looks like quickf water
7491,it just a solution,it is a selution
7492,is dissolving and it is different because the salt,s different dosn't revolle bing and it is different because i the sall
7493,when the solution,with a sallution
7494,good,good
7495,i've been learning about mixture and solutions,i've been learning about mictures and sallutions
7496,because they don't want to go taking for it's and turns get it out,because they don't hav to go dicking for it and tryind to get it out
7497,its learning about mixtures and solutions and is solution is vary you separated and the mixture free put it together,was leirning about mictures and sallutions and a selution is w you seporated and a mixture is reae put it together
7498,this is th dry mixture and you cut megnet and ship in the cup and picks up about the megnetic stuff and to mix level powder and so all together,this is a drymixture and you cut magnet and sho put it in the cup and it picks up all the magnnetic stuf and you mixed grabbl pouder and soll all together

7564,they need sunlight because it's dying and sunlight helps it grow,ight and it's sunlight because it's dying and sumey helps it grow
7565,yep,a
7566,hello anybody there,hello anybody's ther
7567,so this talks on what we've been learning in class is uhm it's making a habitat,so this talks i will rea te classesit is making a habita
7568,it needs air to breathe,it need air to breathe
7569,it's still alive,still lin
7570,that it is getting bigger to where it's taking up all like the bag space and,thats it is getting bigger towards taking up all like the bagspace and
7571,you put three scoops of salt and the fifteen millimeters of water and you have in but any more than three and now it's saturated,you put three scroups of salt in the fifty million eedes of water and you haven't put any more than three an now it's tchhit
7572,where you put six spoons of salt and to the fifteen millimeters of water and then yeah,then she putd six prnts of sault into the fifty mil minos of water and then yh
7573,it's saturated,it sagerat
7574,that if you put too much it is called a,that  if you put too much it is called a
7575,i'm good,'m go
7576,you putting more than five scoops and you putting scoops and now its saturated,you're putting more than five sgroups and you've put in three sgroups and now it's sagurated
7577,if the solution when you there,it's the sono sin whatether
7578,you put five scoops six of sugar and you put fifteen millimeters,you put five skips six ps of sugr and yhe put fifty million metols of water in it keeps sturing and staring and staring and now it'aguratd
7579,it's a,a
7580,you put three spoon fills up salt and you fifteen minutes,you put three sspon fulls of salt and you put thirtye mots
7581,you put more you put more than six it is saturated,you put more if you put more than six it is sacuraiterd
7582,it's extra and when you shake it up between a,it's extra and when you shake it up it didn't didn't desolve
7583,it is saturated and you put fifteen millimeters of water in that and you put five scoops in there and now saturated,it is cucated and you put fifte million metors of water and there and you put five scroups in theyr an ocagurated
7584,good,good
7585,that's it's not too much it's,that's it's not too much it's
7586,when this on the bottom it is called saturated,when its on the bottom it is called cagurated
7587,if you have to put water and there fifteen millimeters and then you have to give it's to be able to wait and makes sure it's equal,f you have to put water in theire pitty miln mules and then you have to get waits to be able to wait and make sure it's equa
7588,yes,yes
7589,that it that you have that you have to o connect a certain side of the magnet together to get it to magnetize,that i that youll have that youl have to connect a certain side of the magnet together to get it to magnettize
7590,yes,yes
7591,in them,them
7592,yes,yes
7593,um neh in that it you can magnetize e some things by rubbing ing them on a magnet,um the  that i you can magnatize th somethings by rubbing ing them on a magnet
7594,uh no we rubbed a paper clip on a magnet and then tried to connect it to another paper clip without hooking it together,u mw rubbed a paep clip on a magnet then tried to connectit to another paper clip without hoocking it together
7595,yes,yes
7596,the magnets magnetizing the nail so it can pick up the paper clip,the magnets magnettizing the nail so it can pick up the paper clip
7597,you need a certain si a t you need to rub a certain side to the magnet and then rub and then touch that side to a certain any side of the object to you're trying to magnetize,you need a certain s you need to rub a certain side to the magnet and then rub and then touch that side to a ceran inescide of the objecec  trying to magnetizse
7598,um when you by a circuit then it can turn off the light and when you open a circuit then it can turn on the light,um when you close te circut then it can turn off light and when you open a crcet then it can turn on e light
7599,um uh when wa two wires are connected to the battery and one wire's connected to the light bulbs,um one wtwo wires are conected to the batere and one  wires conected to th light bulbs
7600,yes,yes
7601,a battery is uh connected to wires to make two lights turn on,a badtry is  connected to wirs to make two lights turn on
7602,it flows from the battery up the wire and and goes into and then goes into the bulb,it flows from the baddery up the wiere and at gos int and then goes into the ball
7603,if the y battery's wires connected to the wrong end of the battery the motor can't run and then the switch has to face the correct way for the battery for it to make the motor w,if the yo batese wires connected to the long end of the battery the motor can't run and then the swich has to face the coect way for the batery for it to make the motal
7604,a battery's connected to a motor to make the motor run,a bateris conected to a moati to make the motar run
7605,yes it does,yes it does
7606,the energy from it you can make the make a motor or a light run,the enneage un i can make the make a motor or liht on
7607,when the electricity is flowing in it in a circle,the wind electricity is flowing inin a circle
7608,en it will be then what is trying to turn on will be off then if you by the switch it it will turn on,and it will be  then what is trying to turn on will be off then if you close the swish it it will turn on
7609,um w it it buzzed is and and part of it spun around in circles,um it it buzed is  and into pod of it spun around ind circles
7610,there is a switch on it to make the motor turn on and off,there is a swish on it to make the moti torn on an f
7611,um it makes it so that there's energy flowing towards the bulbs,um it makes it so  that there is eanergy flowing towards the buls
7612,um if you need to move something heavy and metal moved to a different place,um if you need to move something heavy and medale le to a different place
7613,good,
7614,with regular magnet you can't drop things if you want to drop it you have to pull it off,with e regur magnet you can't drop things if you want a dropp you have to pull little off
7615,um it was kind of like making a circuit,um it was kind of like making a surcet
7616,no,no
7617,if you can start picking up the washers with it then you can tell it's magnetic,if you can stelt picking up the washes with it then you can tell it's magnettic
7618,yes,yes
7619,um a switch turns the magnet on and off cause it's kind of like completing a circuit,um m t th e swich turns the magnet on and off cause it's kind of light im pleading a sircet
7620,yes,yes
7621,yes,yes
7622,if it isn't able to pick up any washers with in the switch it's open,if it isn't avle to pick up any he washes wi in the swish it's open
7623,um the teacher did an example with the projector,um the teacher i did an example over with the emjector
7624,when this if the switch isn't closed then it can't make the nail into a magnet cause it all has to be connected for it for the nail to be a magnet,win this if this switch isn't closed then it can't make the nail into a magnet cause it all has to be connected wo it al to be a magnet
7625,yeah,yeah h
7626,well i don't really know maybe two or three yards,well i don't really know maybe tw or three yards
7627,yeah a lot of like i think even no i don't know but there were,yeah a lot of like i think even know i don't know but there were
7628,i do i like science but even more i like reading and that's how i started reading about science,i do i like science but even more i like reading and that's haow i started readingabout scis
7629,yeah,yeah
7630,so,so
7631,yeah,yah
7632,yeah exactly,yeah exactlly
7633,okay,
7634,the wire coiled so the first thing,the water coiled so hat the first
7635,i would have a big strong electromagnet that um,i wuld have a big strong electror magnet is that um
7636,a lot a things,a lot of things
7637,well i think there is a little ramp there too so i th an object like a button will go like this and will hit off this and go down there in the coin return,we i think there's a little ramp there to so is an object like a button will go like this and we'll het off this and go down there in the quaiter art
7638,there's a little cable thing and here's a little cable thing running from there and there are,there's a little cable thing and here's a little cable thing retting from there and there are
7639,here to here these are towers with stairs stairs so at the top,here to hear these are towers wu stars stars so at the top
7640,um did it um the electromagnet gets turned on shortly and it attracts the metal bar and it makes it click,um the um the electoro magedit gets turnes od shortly and ittracks the medtle bar and mixks a click
7641,okay what,ok what
7642,yeah,yeah
7643,yeah exactly yeah thirty six and then if they had that for thirty six and then little stops like neighborhoods and things could be the electromagnet and you climb down,yeah exactly yeah thirty six and then if they had that fo thirty six and then little stops like neighborhoods and things could be the electro magnet and you clubbd ont
7644,magnets,magnets
7645,okay oh when i laughed it went up so high it usually when i did this before hardly went up any,ok oh whend i laughed it went up so high it usually when i did this before hardly went up any
7646,so here's i don't know what kind of metal it was but the reason,so heres i don't know what kind of bettl it was but the reason
7647,yeah,yas
7648,computers might use them,computers might use them
7649,mmm yeah probably okay,mabyeah probobbly oka
7650,yeah,yeah
7651,no i should though i got this book about science it's this thick,kno i should no i've got to spoak about sizes at this thick
7652,yeah,yeah
7653,yeah and then people who are hiking in the front range and trying to enjoy their time will just maybe hear a slight whiz in the air as the car comes rushing by instead of,yeahand then  people who are hiking to the front rage od try to enjoy their time will just maybe here a slight wizs in the air as the car comes rushing by instead of
7654,yeah,yah
7655,yeah could i draw it for you okay,ye hw could i draw it for you ka
7656,yeah maybe it's an electromagnet in there then and then the magnet and then the electromagnets that are working inside the computers stick to the magnet and stop working,yuh maybe it's an electora magnet and there then an tand the magnet and then the electral magnets that are work in sinde the computer stick to the magnet and stop working
7657,excuse me um i don't know what you're meaning because some things you measure with get different measurements,excuse me um i don't know what you're meaning because somethings you measure with get different measurements
7658,we've been weighing things and seeing how much of that thing there is,we'v ben weing things and seing how much of that thing there is
7659,since you know line b is fifty and also half of line d you would know that line d is one hundred milliliters,since you know line b is fifty and also half of line  you would know that line d is one hundred midle leaders
7660,it is basically the m amount of water e in a syringe what it can hold is up to fifty milliliters,it is basicun the amount of waterin a range what it can hold is up to fifty midl leaders
7661,and and that it meas and measuring water and also measuring how much water it can can there be in a cup,you baciclyu use it to measure measure water
7662,good,good
7663,i don't know what are i don't know what you are meaning cause that is pretty much all i know so far in this unit,i don't know what r i don't know what you are meaning cause that is pretty much all i know so far in this yunet
7664,you could predict it you could do a lines on the side of it you could pretty much do anything what shows a point of value,ou could predict it you could drawl lins on the side of it you could pretty much do anything that shows a point af vallue
7665,they're about basically measuring and measuring,the're about ily measuring ad measuring
7666,we measured it we measured volume with,we measured it we measured volume lam
7667,d as long as you get the answer it's you pretty much is pretty much impor that it's pre that's pretty much it,as long as you get the answer it's you' pretty much it's pretty much importthat it's prethat's pretty much it
7668,basically at the at one side of the table to the other it depends which side you are are u which side you are measuring from one side to the other,basicaly at the at one side of the table to the other it depens whitch side you are on ywich side you are measuring from one side to the other
7669,basically the tools you should u use are pretty much a meter stick a me a measuring tape or that's pretty much e,bacically the tools you should you used are pretty much a meter stick a m a measuring tape or that's pretty much
7670,as long as you get the answer to your question and you end up with a,b both sides of the measuring standing up at both sides of the thing you are mea
7671,measured the per you measured the pers you measure,it basicaly mean s that you measured the
7672,how long your finger and hand is,how long your finger in hand is
7673,bye sorry if i didn't ans answer all the questions you had bye,by sory if i didn't answer answer all the questions you had by
7674,from front to start basically you just start at one end to the other,from front to start bacecicaly you just start at one end to the other
7675,all s um all the si um all parts you just wanna keep the measuring tape straight as possible,you don't always want to measure all
7676,you may not always get the same answer and you may have measured a little wrong the first time,you may not always get the same answer and you may have measured a little wrong the first time
7677,you basically use a a ruler a measuring tape or something what,you basically use ah a ruller a measuring tape or something what
7678,goo bye martie sorry if i didn't answer all the questions you had goodbye i gotta go,good bye marie sorry if i didn't answer all the questions you had good bye i got a go
7679,a measuring meter a measuring tape and a meter stick are pretty much things what are what help you wit um measure longer distances,a measuring neeter a measuring tape and a meeater stick are pretty much things what are what help you wet a measure long distances
7680,hi,high
7681,i,ave toan
7682,good,good
7683,it's saturated water so that means there's so much salt in the water that it won't dissolve anymore so that means it will sink to the bottom and the water won't dissolve anymore because there's too much salt and now that means it's saturated what is it,it's sagurated water so that means i're so much salt in the water that it won't desulve anymore so that means it will sink to the bottom and the water won't desoulve anymore because there's too much sult t in now that means it seit to riter what is i
7684,asked the same question at the same time the water is saturated which means that it can't have any more salt without it dissolving,ask e scme quesionsmeum the water is sacurated which means that it can have anymore sault without a desolving
7685,i couldn't hear you,like er
7686,what did you say oh wait let me repeat you let me let me can i move my bar please no,what did you say o wait  me repeat you i mea let eancant i move my bar please nol
7687,we've been doing water,meen doing straci  wa
7688,the salt is saturated in the water,thes sall is sacerated in the w
7689,well we've been trying to saturate salt in water so we put fifty millimeters of water in a cup and then we added as much salt as we could until it couldn't evaporate,uh well we've bee trying to setch race sult in water so we put fifty milion meters of water in a cup and then we added as much sault as we could until it couldn't in bapper
7690,it's saturated asked you like the same question do you have to ask the same question,it's sagerratennow you liked the same queston  o lived to anske the same question
7691,that it's saturated,that it's satter ra
7692,the sugar isn't dissolving and that means that it dissolves better than the epsom salt,ah the cugere isn't desolving and that means it desolves better than the ecenso
7693,the fifty millimeters of water is heavier because they added salt and the other fifty milliliters of water doesn't have any salt and there's nothing else in it so it's just water and they both have,fiftythe fifty millioniters of water is heavier because they added selt ind the ethefity maters doesn't have any selt and there's nothing else in it so it' just water and they both hav
7694,not hi how are you,not a high um how are you
7695,by using weights,by using waight
7696,the salt and the water and that the salt at the bottom is saturated because the water can't dissolve any more salt and that means that there's too much salt in the water,the sult in the water and that that the sult at the bottom is cagurated because the water cadesalv anymore sult an that means there's too much sult in the wat
7697,the sugar heads to the bottom,these suger heads to the bottom
7698,so the water with fifty millimeters is saturated which means there's too much salt for it to dissolve so it can't dissolve anymore so the salt that's not dissolving is at the bottom,um so the water which pisty mill meaters is saturated which meads er too much salt for it to desolve so it can't desolve anymore so the salt that's not desoulvin is at the bot
7699,well the water is saturated which it means it can't it can't dissolve anymore salt because that means it's saturated and it has too much water i mean salt into the water so it's not so it's not gonna dissolve and then yeah and so it's saturated so they,well the water is sagurated which it means it can it can't desalved anymore sult because that means atsaturated it has to much water i meansault into the water so it's not so it's not gin desolve i tan y and sol is saturated so
7700,that means it's saturated salt,that means an'atgurated s
7701,you weighed it with the weight,you wait it with the waiht
7702,you made it heavier by putting the salt in the water and you just had so you had the same amount of water which they weighed the same so if you put salt in the other one that makes it heavier and if you didn't put any salt in the other one then it's gonna be the same,you made it heaver by putting the salt in the water and you just had so you have the same amount of water which they wigh the same so if you puit salt in the other one that makes it heavier and if you didn't put any sat in the other one en it' cant be the same s
7703,the salt solution and the water so the the the water has salt in it so that means it's heavier and the one the,these sub scallution in the water so thirethe water has sault in it so that means its heavier and the one the
7704,it's sixty seven grams because you used the weights to measure it and then you would count how many weights,uh uh uh it's sixty seven grams because you use the wits to measure it and then you incount how many wa
7705,and it it you guys are measuring the water that and then and and it's sixty,and i i i you gus are measuring  the water that ini an it's sixty
7706,what'd you say can you say it again i don't know what you said what'd you say can you tell me again repeat repeat repeat repeat repeat,what do you say can you say it again i don't know it he said what you say can you tell me again repete repete repete repete repe
7707,how are you,are you
7708,you're measuring how heavy the solution is,your measuring how heavy thy sullution is
7709,there are brain cells and which are different,there were brainsos and which ared em different
7710,it's trying to show me that so that that these are brain cells,it's trying to show me thattha these that these are brains sews
7711,i see skin cells which are also different from brain cells and uhm muscle cells,i see skinsells which are also different from brain sas and um u muscle sels
7712,uhm plants are not single celled organisms they have more than one cell,plants are not single silled orgonisoms they have more than one sel
7713,uhm the human and the yeast are both made of cells they are different types of cells but they are still cells,um the human and the eastre both made e selves they are diferent tips eselves but there still selv
7714,i see different types of cells,do i see different types themselves
7715,that uhm skin cells are also an important part of the body,that om skin sells are also an importantpart of the body
7716,uh uhm humans also have several cell uh a lot of cells,u he  um humns also have several sea lot of sellves
7717,those are cells,those are sos

7732,without water it'll it will die,um without water it  it will um am d
7733,yes,yes
7734,i don't know,i don't know
7735,it makes it decay even more than it does without sunlight,it makes it dok even more than it does without sunlight
7736,all living things need air to breathe,all living things need air to breathe
7737,they do make their food but i don't know how,they do make their food but i don't know how
7738,maybe because they are a type of plant,maybe because there  a type of plant
7739,without producers the food webs would just start falling apart,um without producers um the fluid webs would just um start falling ap
7740,yes,yoh yes
7741,yes they need water to survive because whenever something is dehydrated it will die,yes they need water to survive and because um and whenever something is deirated iit  it will d
7742,really small particle,i really small particle
7743,that plants also have basic survival needs like water and and,that plants also have bacicruble needs vimwater and s

7747,the sun,the sun
7748,plants need food water and air but not shelter or fertilizer,pmants need um food and water in air but not shelter or furtalize
7749,good,goo
7750,without a certain type of food plants will die,withhout em i couldn't have a flute um paants will die
7751,because they're the same type of plant but one of them is more decayed than the other,because they are the same tip of panant but i oneof them is more docate than the other
7752,i don't know,i don't know
7753,they start with decomposers then producers then they end with consumers,the start with the composers then producers then they end with concumers
7754,they're all parts of it,there all parts of it
7755,grass and it's it it's grass and it's type it's a type of plant,grass and it's it its grass an its tip it's a tipe plant
7756,because it's their main source needs for survival and without it they'd just die,because it' sme there um man m sort m needs for survival and  without it they d um just d
7757,i see a picture of a hamburger and a plant,i see a picture of a han burger and a plant
7758,no,no
7759,yes every living thing needs air to survive because otherwise they couldn't breathe and they'd just die,yes um everyliving thing need air to orvrive because other wise they couldn't breathe an they just d
7760,they make their own food,they make their own fo
7761,that a lot of different things feed on each other and there are decomposers producers and consumer,that a lot of different things feet on each other and mthere are decomposers o producers and consumer
7762,one of them has probably not gotten as much water,one of them is probably not goten as much wat

7765,i don't know,i don't know
7766,it shows that plants need sunlight water and water can evaporate from it,it shows that um plants needed sunight water n then um wwater can vapporatet from it um
7767,the plant is decaying because but it has water and air it just doesn't have sunlight,the plant is to came because but it has water and air it just desn't have sunlight
7768,some kind of can and a with a picture of an apple on it,some kind of can andwith a picture of an appl
7769,i i think they do need water because pretty much everything needs water to survive without it we'd all dehydrate and die,i i think they do need water because um io pretty much every liveingthing needs watertotust errive without it we'd all be highe rahe and die
7770,i i think they do because i think plants do need air because if they didn't have air they'd all just they wouldn't be able to breathe and they'd just die,i think they do because i think baancdo need air because if they didn't have air they all justhey wouldn't be abe to breathe and they just die
7771,plants need sunlight to survive otherwise they'd be too cold and they'd and then they'd they would die,um plants ned smight ist arrive bcause otherwise m theyd be too cod and they g  and then they thi they would die
7772,this one has enough water air and sunlight,um this one has enough water air and sunni
7773,it doesn't it didn't get enough it doesn't get enough sunlight,it doesn't it didn't get ait doesn't get enough sunlight
7774,cause it doesn't have too much or too little of sunlight water or air,cause it doesn't have too much for too little of water sunnight or air
7775,yes cause then they'd get too cold and die,yes cause then theyd m get too coll and die
7776,yes because it's a type of soil and plants need to be put in soil to survive,myes um because it's  tipf s soil and france ned to be put in soil to survive

7780,it it does not look sickly it looks really nice because it has water sunlight and air,it t it does not look tickly it looks really nice because it has water sunnight and ai
7781,they're both types of plants,tere both types of plants
7782,yes it would die of hunger and and there would be no plant,yes it would die of hunger and um and there would be no pr
7783,it looks more much more decayed and yeah and orange and sickly because it has sunlight and water but no air,um it looks more and much more decate and umyah and orangis and um sickly because it has sunlight and water but no ai
7784,plants need shelter when it's like cold during like the winter and other time,panas and e chiltorit an when it's i cold during thewinter in t other time
7785,they're a part of a food web,they are part of a fir of a flute web
7786,i don't know,i don't know
7787,when the cookie gets wet it turns into yeast,when the cooki gets whet it turns into yus
7788,i don't know how to answer that,i don't know how to answer that
7789,the number of the passengers on the y axis,the number of the passengers go ing to wie axes
7790,it shows um uh um the bigger the boat is in a group the more um it can hold,it shows um u um the h bigger the boat is in't te group the more um it can hold
7791,x capacity of boats,ex copasity of boaths
7792,well you can only change one variable in a science project,but you can only change one veriable and a science project
7793,you could figure it out cause the the green line goes up and the further up it goes the the bigger the boat and so it tells you which boat is smaller and which is bigger,you coald figue it outcause the the green line gos up and the further up it goes the the bigger the boat o and so it tells you which boat is smaller an which is bigger
7794,says the capacity of boats,says the copassity of boats
7795,it has the independent variable on the x axis,it has the independant veriable on the ex axes
7796,marnie i have to go now,marning i have to go now
7797,that there can fit more passengers in in bigger boats,that there can fet more passengers in and bigger boats
7798,it says that dependent variable,it says the dependant veriable
7799,the bigger the boat the more passengers,the bigger the boat the more passengers
7800,numbers counting by ten,numbers counting by ten
7801,you have to think about how big the boat is and um you have to uh think about how heavy the pennies are,you have to think about how big the boat is and um you have to u think about how heavy the pennies are
7802,well the dependent variable is one variable that gets changed,ol the dependant veriable is one veriable that it's changed
7803,the further up you go from the red line the the more it show the more passengers it shows,the further up you goo from the red line the the more it sho the more passengerers it shows
7804,you can tell um how many passengers can go on the boat and the capacity of the boat,you can tell um how many passengers can go on the boat in the copassity of the boat
7805,hi,high
7806,we've been um working on collecting data for science,we've been um working on collecting data fir sciences
7807,it tells you how many passengers were on that boat,it tells you how many passengers were on that boat
7808,showing data,showing data
7809,well if there is some water in the boat then it would make the boat get go down a little bit more,llif there was some water in the boat then it would make the boat gal go down a little bit more
7810,y numbers of passengers,why numbers of pasurors
7811,i don't really know how to answer that question,i don't really know how to answer that question
7812,mckenna,marchana
7813,the y the x axis,the wa and the x axes
7814,it connects cause each var each boat has a different size,it connecs cs each vr each boat has a differenc size
7815,tells you how many passengers can go on the boat,tells you how many passengers can go in the boat
7816,the more um uh water that's in the boat to is makes it go down more,the more um u water thats in the boat  it is makes it go down more
7817,we've been working on variables and collecting data,we've been working on veriables and collecting day
7818,you can only change one variable t,yo coulnd only change one veriable
7819,the bigger the boat is the more passengers can go on the boat,the bigger the boat is the more passengers can go in the boat
7820,the bigger the boat the more passengers so if the boat was like four inches it could probably hold like maybe thirty passengers,the bigger the boat the more passengers so if the boat was like four inches that could probably hold like may be thirty passengers
7821,i discovered that the bigger the boat is the more passengers it can hold,i discovered that the bigger the boat is more passengers hat can hold
7822,well the size of the boat can hold less water and the bigger the boat can hold more water,well the size of the boat can hold less water and the bicker the boat can hold more water
7823,you graph the independent variable on the y uh the x axis,you grthe independant veariable in the waer  the ex exes
7824,and tells you how many um passengers can fit in um the the length of the boat,and tells you how many um passengers can fit in um the the length of the boat
7825,the different sizes are the of the boats are the ones are the variables that are changed,the different sizes are the of the boats ar the ones ar the veriables that are changed
7826,we're trying to see how many pennies we can get in the boat without it sinking,were trying to see how many pennies we can get in the boat without it sining
7827,you do the best you can with them,you do the best you can with them
7828,good,good
7829,well you could decide what procedure you're doing on what makes it easy or um harder if you want a challenge,well you could decide what proceege ore you're doing on what makes it easy or um harder if you want a challange
7830,so um you could have more data and it would make the project better,so um you could have more data and it would make the project better
7831,you can figure out um how many pennies go in the different sizes of boats,you can figure out um how many pennies go in the different sizes of boats
7832,well to have a controlled experiment you you have to keep all the things the same except one,well to have a controlled experiment you you have to keep all the things the same except one
7833,they have to make sure it's only one variable and they they don't accidently mess up and um make the waters like wave crazy,they have to make sure it's only one veriable and they they don't accidentaly misc up and um make the waters like wave crazy
7834,i don't get how to answer that question,i don't get how to answer that question
7835,yeah,viah
7836,this has to do with the standard procedure because it has to stay balanced otherwise you won't get the right data,it's has to do with a standerd preciger because it has to stay bounced otherwise you won't get the right data
7837,only one,only one
7838,yup,yet
7839,measuring the capacity is perfect for this cause um cause then you can collect more data than you would have if you didn't,measuring the capassitie's perfect for this cause um cause then you can collect more date than you would have if you didn't
7840,hi,high
7841,recording your data,recorting you'r data
7842,the one that put the pennies in balanced um got a lot more pennies in than the one that was unbalanced,the one that put the pennies then balenced um got a lot more pennies than than the one that was un baowenced
7843,that um the boats were all different sizes,that um the boats were ll different sizes
7844,yeah,yeah
7845,cup a collected the most um the most water because it's the biggest cup,cup  collected the most um the most water because it's the biggest cup
7846,that the bigger the boat is the more passengers it can hold,that the bigger the boat is the more passengers tat can hold
7847,the water in the boat can get pretty high,the water in the boat kaint get pretty high
7848,you had to make sure that the pennies went in balance so that the boat won't tip over and sink,you had to make sure that the pennies went in baence so that the boat wouldn't tip over and sink
7849,they um put uh they the each boat is a different size and they put one penny in at a time,they um pt uh they the each boat is a different size and they put one penny in at a time
7850,they changed the size of the boat and,they changed the size of the boat and
7851,you have to make sure that every variable is the same except one,you have to make sure that every verable is the same except one
7852,it relates cause i know how much um well how big the cup was but i didn't know how much water it could hold,it relats cause i knew how much um wel how big the cup was but i didn't know how much water it could hold
7853,we're still working on the boats wi with pennies and um the other things,were still working on the boats wit with pennies n um the other things
7854,yes,yes
7855,yeah,yeeah
7856,each time a penny gets put in the boat sinks a little,each time a penny gets ut in the boat sinks a little
7857,we kept all the variables the same except one,we kept all the veriables the same except one
7858,um slower or faster depending on how much weight,um slop war or faster depending on how much wiht
7859,there is one really long one there is one medium one and a really short one,there's one really long one there's oe an medium one in a realy short one
7860,the longer the string is the less swing swings it does,the longer the string is the less swing swings it does
7861,so you can see which way it works better,so you can see which way works better
7862,it has weight at the bottom,it has wight at the bottom
7863,it goes all the way up on one side then to the other side and then back again,it goes all the way up on one side then to the other side and them back again
7864,in science we are learning how to collect data,insience we are learning how to collect data
7865,it goes back and forth really fast,it goes back and forthreally fast
7866,depending how much pennies are on there it would go slower or faster,depending how much pennies are on there it would go slower ord faster
7867,so you,sa
7868,they all had the same number of swings,they all ad the same number of swings
7869,hi,by
7870,the string is hanging on something and it goes back and forth a few times until it stops slows down,the string is hanging on something and it goback ind forth a few times until it stops slows down
7871,we see what changed each time we did something,we see what chananged each time we did something
7872,well there has to be some sort of weight at the bottom so that it can swing otherwise it would just be too light,well there hase to be some sort of waite at the bottom so that it can swing otherwise it would just be too light
7873,it's going good how about you,it's going good how about you
7874,each one has a different amount of pennies on it,each one has a different amount of pennies on it
7875,it's in a paperclip hanging from a string,it's in a paper clip hanging from a string
7876,pendulums are things that like hang from something um and they can swing back and forth,pendulims are things that like hanging from something um and they can swing back and forth
7877,you could change how high it's hanging,you could chainge how high it's hanging
7878,we made little lifeboats and um and then we like put pennies in it for the people and see how many people could go in before it sank,we made little life boats and um and then we like put pennies in it fur the people and see how many people could go in before it sank
7879,good,good
7880,the boat would start to tip over and kind of start to go down in the water,the boat would start to tip over and tennot start to go down in the water
7881,they had to be three centimeters long,they had to be three seven meters long
7882,we used the dixie cups and like cut um around it to make it smaller so that i don't really know oh so it would like balance,we use thoe dicksy cups and like cut um around it to make it smaller su that i don't really know oh so it would like ballence
7883,um the one on the left side is balanced upright and then the one on the right side is about to sink cause it's unbalanced,on the one on the left side is balence up right and then tel one on the right side is about to tink case it's un baenced
7884,each one is a different size,each one is a different size
7885,it might affect the number of passengers because if the water's going all crazy then it could cause that cup to flip over,it might effect the number of pascaggers because  the water is going all crazy than it could cause the cup to slip over
7886,you need to make sure that you all um that you put the pennies in each lifeboat at the same height and like not all at the same time like one at a time for each one,you need to make sure that you all um that you put the pennies in each life boat at the same hight and like not all at the same time like one at a time for each one
7887,they're just dropping it in and that causes the boat to get more pressure put on it so it falls down before the left side does,the're just dropping it in and that causes the boat to get more pressure put on it so it falls down before the left side dos
7888,you would put the um cup in the water and then uh put one penny in at a time to see how long it took before it sank,you would put the um cup in the water and then uh put one pennyan at a time to see how long it took before it sank
7889,um you got to make sure there's no water in the boat or else um or or else it could cause the boat to go down more than it would if there was no no water in the cup,um you got o mix ure there's no water in the boat or else um or or else it could cause the boat to go down more than it would if there was n no water in the cup
7890,they put so much on one side that that side just sunk without getting more in,they put so much on one side that that side just sunk without getting more in
7891,getting from one place to another in water,getting from one place to another in water
7892,each time you put a penny in it sunk a little bit more,each time you put a penny in it sunk a little bit more
7893,the more pennies and there's more pennies in the taller one and in the cup a,the more pennies and there's more pennies in the toller one in in the cup a
7894,we've been um making little lifeboats and using pennies as people and dropping them in and seeing how long it took for the lifeboat to sink in water,we've been um making little life boats and using pennies as people and dropping them in and seing how long it took for the life boat to sink in water
7895,well if it's if it's a bigger um cup then it could probably fit more pennies in before it sinks,well if it's if it's a bigger um cup than it could probably fit more pennies than before it sinks
7896,so it doesn't mess up your experiment,so it doesn't massh up your experiment
7897,group d has the most pennies,groupd has the most pennies
7898,you have to make sure that you only change one thing or else that you won't know the difference between other things that you do cause it would mess up the experiment,you have to make sure that you only change one thing or else the you won't know the difference between other things that you do cause it would mess up the experiment
7899,they got a a lot more pennies in the left side cause they put it in more carefully,they got am a lot more pennies in the left side cause they put it in more carefully
7900,you need to make sure that each cup is exactly three centimeters or else it could cause um a big difference between one cup and another,you need to make sure that each cup is exactly three seven meeters or else it could cause um a big difference between one cup and another
7901,nothing,nothing
7902,it had to be small to fit in the top of water,it had to be small to fit in the tub of water
7903,you can um change the the height of the cup and it can hold more pennies that way,you can um change the the hight of the cup and it can hold more pennies that way
7904,there's more in the left side because they stacked it evenly so it could balance better,there's more on the left side because they stacked it evenly so it could ballence better
7905,float,float
7906,you can see when um when the how many pennies are in there it starts to get really by to the water and then it sinks after the last penny goes in,you can see when um when the how many pennies are in thei'r sorts to get really close to the water and then it sinks after the last penny goes in
7907,a car is a system has wheels a chair and engines and other stuff,a coar is a sistom as wheels a chair and engins and another stuff
7908,that they would all match up and be able to eat each other,that they would all match up and be able to eat each othee
7909,a car is a system and a car and part of the system is the wheels and the engine and everything that makes it move,a carsa sistom and a car in part of the sistom is the wheels and theengi in everything that mixs it moove
7910,i see forests and animals and i see water and other animals and forest and greens and plants yeah,i see forets i knows and i see water and other animal an foret grins and plantss
7911,it's a food chain of all the food yeah,it's a food train of all the food ye
7912,that the human body is a big system with a whole bunch of subsystems,that the human body is a big sisteron thewith a hoe buncres sumbe sistoms
7913,it shows some of the subsystem it shows some of the subsystems in the big system,it shows some less ubcisting su sm it shows somles sub sistoms in the big sistom
7914,the um the desert has different animals and plants and the wet areas have fish coral and other organisms,the um h desert has different animals and plants and the waras have ver corl lat other orgonisom
7915,four of them one of them called the atmosphere and the other one is there's another one called the biosphere i don't know what the other ones are called yeah,for fthem one of oe's called the atmsferer and the other wars calld there is another one called e buttl spere i don't know what the ote ones are calld yeah ye
7916,these subsystems are part of the earth,these subsistoms are part of the earth
7917,well the earth is a big subsystems with a whole bunch of things like the biosphere and the atmosphere and other sphere,wellthe earth is a big suftifn with   bunch of things lhike g the vile sfeare and the atmisfeare and other fear
7918,the sphere is mainly made up of water yeah,b wi sprs meayly bete up of water
7919,it shows all the animals eats to all the way until they get back to the end so they can start a,it crus  what the animals eats do all the way til they get back to the end to they canstart
7920,they all are living organisms,at day are living or gon o them
7921,all of the parts that make it move like the wheels and the axle and the exhaust and the engine,all the parts then they can't move like the wheeles n te acxill and megs o and the entren
7922,the engine is connected to the wheels so the wheels will move the car and it's also connected to the,the endyon is connected to the wheels so the wheels mi move the car and edus condected to th
7923,all the blood veins,the blood vain
7924,i think the ecosystem is the big thing and the biosphere is the subsystem,the eaglest sistom is the big thing and the bi spirit is the subsist
7925,good,good
7926,we're subsystems on top of the big system earth,w were sub sistoms on top of the big sistom earth
7927,in the forest and stuff like that,ins in the forestsand stuff like that
7928,a train,ao trainhod
7929,oh the water and the fish in there and the coral and all the organisms that live down in the sea,oh the water and thefish and theye are te quaurrl and al thoh orgonisoms that live down in the cea
7930,learning about system,learning about sistom
7931,yes the earth has a whole bunch of systems like the biosphere the atmosphere it has cars computers us,yes dorth has hopnyo sistoms like the bile spere l at misfere as cars computers us
7932,matching up together so they can so and that's a cycle how they eat each other and effect each other and kill each other until it gets back to point a,actring up together so they can and that's as sickl p ti each other and aqlicked each other and kill each other te'le gets back to point a
7933,animals eat people so they go all the way around the cycle until they come back to point a,er animals eat people for they go allorround they go until they come back tthe point
7934,that they all match up together somehow,that' he alld my trup togetherp omehow
7935,it's a food cycle yeah,it's a food like   y
7936,the layer of the earths i see a bio system i see um the atmosphere i see buildings that have a system in it i see mountains,t the layors  that were rth i see t bioh sistom i see on the atmisfere i see buildings that have sistoms and  i seemountains
7937,the wheels the engine and everything and then um engine makes the wheels move so the car will move and drive,the wheel is the intnt every thing and te um en tea mix the wheels move to the carpo move and drive
7938,a car,ocaa
7939,earth is a big subsystem and it has a whole bunch of moving parts,earth is a big sub sistom ant has a whope on trip ofing parks
7940,a human is a system and it has a whole bunch of subsystems like the lungs the heart the intestines the kidney,human s a sistom and it has a hole m as subsisterms like ewongs yeho the intestinant kid
7941,i think it's made up of animals and plants and other waters stuff,i gets made up of animals at dent and other waters stuf
7942,great,great
7943,leaf this is a pennate leaf,eleaf this is a pinnate leaf
7944,we've been learning about leaves and their veins and both their vascular bundles,we've been learning about e leafs and their vains and thei'r basgelor buls
7945,mainly because it has one vein centered thing and it has other leaves spreading like other veins spreading out,migh leaf because it has one mein centerd thing and it has other leaves spreadding like other brain sprerting outs
7946,parallel because the veins are running parallel to each other,parlo because the vaines are running parlo to each other
7947,this is the palmate leaf,this is a poll mate leaf
7948,the beach leaf is a pennate because it had a shape like a feather and it has one main vein running through the middle of other one shooting out,the beach leaf is a aae because it isis shape like a feather and has one man vain running to the middle of alther one shoting out
7949,suitcase has interacting parts that hold it together have wheels and stuff like that that help it work together,um the soot case has intracting parts that hol um hold it together have wheeles and stuff like thats that help it um work together
7950,we've talked about the hydrosphere biosphere geosphere and atmosphere all four systems,sac we've talked about the hiros feare bis fear eos fear and atmosfear all four sistoms
7951,good,good
7952,make what makes it a system is the interacting parts like the wheels exhaust and the drivetrain and windshield seat belt chairs they all work together to make the one system a car,makes what makes it a sistom is the interacting parts like the wheels exsost in drie train and whin shelds seet belt shars that'll work together to make to one sistom a car
7953,this has to do with systems because if these parts like the exhaust i mean the drivetrain the exhaust and the wheels weren't there and other stuff the car would wouldn't even be able to move,this has to do ith sistoms because if these parts like the exost i mean the drive train the exsost nd the wheel is wern't beare another stuff the car would woldn't even be able to move
7954,in science we've been learning about systems the food chain food webs stuff like that,in cience we've been learning about um sistums the food chain food webs um stuf like that
7955,awesome,otom
7956,i saw and heard that the ding they are all sleeping and then the ding dong woke them up and the dog starts barking because he started all the human is like i just want to go back to sleep,i saw and heard um that the didn't they wre all sleeping and then the ding dog woke them up and the dog starts barking because he startled the humans like  just want to go back to sleep
7957,the reaction is if he hears or sees the little mosquito land on him and then he brings down his hand to kill it so it doesn't kill it doesn't harm him and he goes,the reaction is he he he se he hears or sees the little mskeo lands on him and then he brings down his hand to kill it so it doesn't kill that doesn't harm him and he goes
7958,so the main points was central nervous system responds and stimulus,so the main points were ecentral nervousnes some respontce and stimulu
7959,control nervous system is basically the body's thing so the brain sends something like he wants the foot to move forward and the foot moves forward because of the nerves and the electric impulses running through the nerves,atral nervous sistim is bacicaly the bodys think so thet brain sens something like he wants to flit to move forward and tfut moves forward because of the neurves in the electric impulses running through the ne
7960,the reaction is the slapping on the hand,the reaction is the slapping on the hands
7961,so the guy here is really that sound is like and he's really like calm and all and like oh well oh what was that,um so the guy hearers  relly loud soundings li and he was really like calm and olnsi o well what what was tha
7962,brain tells the sends the message to the motor neurons they go through the spinal cord and like the electric impulses to the motor neurons and then the muscles move,srain tells the sends the message to the motor narns be gos to this final cort and the lectrica impulsis to the motor erncs and then the muscles move
7963,this is showing us the bee giving certain directions to all other friends to like a flower garden they're all going to go there they're going to tell they're other friends and then that's going to be a like a big v party there,this is showing us to beat give men certan directions to all his  the'r friends to ige flour garden hand they'reall gouing to go to bear tere ging to tell ll the're other friends and the inets gve me like a big be party ther
7964,if that bee didn't do that then they wouldn't be able to find anymore or the flowers they're all go to one certain flower and tell they're all if that flower is gone then they're gone,if that bea didn't do that ten they wouldn't be ill to find anymor or the flowers they hould all go to one certan flower untell they all to flo if that flower was gone didn they gone
7965,the guy accidentally knocked over the bowl of juice and that was the stimulus and they when they get nice shirt it was quite stained and so when that stimulus he quickly jumped out so more then get on his,the gy accidentaly knocked over the bottle of juese and that was the stimmulucin th then the when it gets on they got suret it was frght stained and so when that stimmuless he quickly jumped up so more tan get on his sh
7966,the stimulus was the piece that grape juice fallen over and yeah then a guy jumping up real fast was the response,the stimuliss was t piece that thet great jusefallen over and then ah yuh the guy jumping up reall fast was the a responce
7967,see this little pretty dog as see the lunch and he's going into attack mode and saying back off i'm ready to strike or he swings this is no potential predator he says back off i can defend myself,sees this little prary doggate as ether lun rinne's going into a tackmoate and saying back off i'm ready to a strike or he's thinks this is no patencial credatour he says back off i can defend myself
7968,this is uhm looks like wind and it i don't think that plants need wind to,this is um tlooks like winds and i i don't think that plnas need wind to serv
7969,thing about producers and food webs is without the producers everything is going to die eventually everything's going to be killed off because there's no basic food source that the producers give,thing about producers and food webs is without the producers everything is going to die ventually everything is going to be killed off because there's no baic food sors that the producers kif
7970,plants need a place to live so they can't just be floating in air in the ocean they need a suitable place to live,blants need a place to live ts they can't just be floating in mid air in the ocean they need a suitable place to li
7971,yes this plant needs water to survive,yes this plant needs water to surv
7972,it ahs everything it needs to grow it has water carbon dioxide and sunlight that means that it is able to do stuff,n has everything it needs to grow it has water carmn dy acite and sunlight that means it it is able to do stuff
7973,what's going on is the yeast is uhm being breaking its dormancy with the sugar from the graham cracker,what's going on is the yeast is um being breaking its normncy with the sugere from the grand crack
7974,they make their food through photosynthesis so they take the light energy and they make it into uhm they take uhm the light energy and they make it into sugars,they make their food through toto cenpaces so they take the light energy and they c make it in cho ins um they take um the the light ahnergy and they make it into suguars
7975,the plant needs uhm carbon dioxide uhm sun heat and h o two,r the plant needs um caron dy oside um sun heats and acho to hert
7976,this one is uhm sun or light and heat and the plant needs heat and no a little bit of heat but mostly light to survive,sone is um sun or lights and the heat and the plant needs heat and ano a little bit of heat but mostly light to survive
7977,it has all the stuff it needs to do its basic functions sunlight carbon dioxide and water,that has all a stuff it needs to do its bacic puntins sunlight carmon dy eside ind water
7978,each one of those circular cells is a single yeast cell a piece of yeast is just one cell that's it,each one of those circulorselves is a single ye sell a piece of yeace is just one sell that's it
7979,we have been studying about how uh plants get their food and their nutrition,we haven't studying about how a plants get their food and thei'r newtritio
7980,some of the main points are what plants need to grow uhm that's pretty much the main point that we've been talking about,some of the main points are what plants need shoul grow um that's pretty much io the main paine what we've been talking about
7981,you doing today marni,be doing today morr
7982,yeast is a fungi that uhm is used in bread,easet is a fung gy that um is used in bread
7983,that makes it unable to some simple uhm like functions like being able to stay alive because it needs carbon dioxide to be able to produce energy,that makes it un able to do some simple um like funtions like bein able to stay allive cause it needs car carbn by oscide to be  to produce energy
7984,going on is it has water which is good it has sunlight but it has no carbon dioxide so the plant is not being able to function without the carbon dioxide,on its it has water which is good it has sunlight butit has no carodyokside so it the planis not being able t o funtion  ved te car dioside
7985,plants need things like carbon dioxide to help uhm create energy the water is used for energy and the light is used for energy,plants need things like caran diocide to help um tree energy the water is used with fr energy and a light is used for energy
7986,wilted is the name same thing for like dried up no water means it's pretty wilted,willes i the name same thing for like dride up no water means it's pretty wilted
7987,the plant has sun it has air but it doesn't have any water or it wasn't given any water so that means that it has no water to help the plant grow,the plant has sun it has air but it doesn't have any water or ithawoesn't given any water so that means that has no water to help the plant grow
7988,that means a bear is an omnivore,that means to bear itis an onibe
7989,plants are producers because they make their own food through photosynthesis from the sun and they all and if they if you take away the plants slowly the whole food chain will collapse,plants are producers because they make their own food rom total senforcess from the sun and they 'll in um a if they if you take away the plants s slowly the whole floud chane will colaps
7990,a moose is a herbivore because it eats little grass out of the lakes and it eats trees too,a mose is a erb of war because it eats um little grass out of the leakes and it eats trees t
7991,it has to do with what we've been talking about because it's all about the carnivores and all that stuff and how they how they stay alive,it has to do well we ben talking about because it's all about thecar bords um  all that stuff and how they how they stay l
7992,herbivores means you eat only plants nothing else,erbvars mean that you eat only plants nothing else
7993,connects to being a carnivore because it carnivores only eat meat that means they're a second level consumer or higher because yeah,conectto bein a cirnof bard because it eat cono borts only eat meat that means are a second level consumer or higher because  um yeh
7994,the decomposers are the mushrooms and the bacteria in this picture,the deep composers are the mushrooms in the bac tariea in this picture
7995,to the environment cause it would be what they really do in real life except they might be doing it with dead bodies and not newspaper and they would probably be still be doing that with leaves and all that,ul the environment cause it would be what they really do in reall life except they might be doing  dead bodies did not newspaperand they would bry still be doing leaves in all thats
7996,the missing type of organism is a decomposer because there's only bacteria in this picture and i know there's more than just bacteria that can decompose dead,the mistun type of orgonisom is a deecomposure because um thre's only a bacariea and this picture and i know there's more than just bactariea that can de composed dead anim
7997,the producers are the pine cone and the trees and the grass because they all make their food from photosynthesis,the producers are the pine cone and the trees and the grass because they all make their food befo the s enpecess
7998,almost all plants except for the venus fly traps are producers,almost all plants except for the vienus fly traps i'm prt sure are producers
7999,a thing a produce organism that has to eat other things to stay alive is a consumer,a thing um a produce ah orgonisom that has to eat other things to um stay alive is a consumer
8000,herbivores only eat producers they are the first level consumers,ervors only eat producers they are the first level concumers
8001,is a decomposer cause it breaks down stuff like leaves food scraps probably also like dead bodies,form is a um de composer bcause it breakes down stuff like leaves  scraps probly also thike dead bodyes
8002,good,good
8003,is a decomposer,a dee composure
8004,animals get their food by eating each other or eating producers,animals get their food by eating each other or eating producers
8005,that makes him first level consumer,that makes him a first levil consumer
8006,because they are a decomposer and that's what decomposers do,because they are a comp composer and ats what te composers do
8007,it makes them producers because they don't eat any other animal or themselves or any other thing to get it they make their food from photosynthesis,it makes o producers because they don't eat any other animal or themselves or any other thing to get it they make their food for total cenci
8008,this is what i just sent and that's a diagraph this is what all i just send except labelled,this is what i just sed anounced a diagrapf right there this is all what i just seid except lay bolds
8009,the letter f represents it,the letter a reppresents him
8010,it is a give out the carbon dioxide and bring in oxygen,bitting a sa give  to the car from the oxcide and bring in oxyge
8011,it is letter h,it is letter h
8012,good,good
8013,in a diaphragm to contrast your lungs,id the dio framic contrast yure on lungs
8014,these are the little tubes that carry the air and the carbon dioxide out of the body,these are litttle tubes that carry the air and the carmday occide outof the body
8015,it's the diagram of how the human breaths first it breaths in and comes down trachea into the lungs into the bronchioles into the lungs and finally into the little alveoli,the diagram ho the human breeze first it breates hen comes down and trikya into the lungs into the wel into the brocks into the lungs and finally ino helittle av yu l
8016,v trachea,be rak

8018,we've been learning how this system such as circulatory system vascular system on digestive system respiratory system,ben learning how this thi sistom such a circulitoria sistom fvasuoder sistom um di justi sistom pespetory sistom
8019,the respiratory systems are to the mouth of the nose where it comes down into the trachea and then into the bronchioles then into the lungs and then into the bronchiole then finally into the little alveoli,when resprs oices some starts at the mouth of the nose where it comes down into the trokya then into the brockas then into the longs then t the brockols then finally to the little  e ol l
8020,the air comes in the body from the nose and the mouth,the air comes in the body and the nose in the mouth
8021,d the diaphragm,be the diofram
8022,it has certain fur and perhaps in the camouflage and the smell it reeks because so the other predators already know stay away from that thing again predators know that the,it has certan fur and that pry hels om the camb fls ind the ind a smell it reaks because so teother printers already kno stay way fom that thing it can produces a smell that re
8023,number two helps the duck to swim its web feet pushed in the water more than open hands like fingers like this my hand opened up all the way because they're opened up,snumber two helps the deck to scream it's wep feet pushed throghthe water more than open hands like fingers i list my hand open up all the way because they're open
8024,it's like this rattlesnake thing the skunk the wolf knows that oh on that skunk is smells horrible and this skunks like oh yeah you better back away,e like this rile snake thing the sunk that wolf nos that oh kno that stunk is smell is horribboat and thit's going sig oh yea i ud better back away
8025,turtles are just crawling out because it's an instinctual behaviour they know just it,turtles are just crawing out because it's an instinks e'll be hager they know ajestic
8026,defending its territory is a natural behavior so and the wolf knows stay away from that skunk he's going to make a horrible smell,te fnniits territory it's a nattural behaviure so in the wolf nose stay away from that skik es can make a horrible smell
8027,sharp teeth help them remove flesh to swallow the meat,but sharp teeth help am ri food flesh tu it swollow the meat
8028,it's boring they would not know they would probably just touch the stove and they quickly take it off and start crying because they didn't know that it was hot,it'sporn uh bht y would not know they would probably just touch a stone and thet quickly take it off from sart crying because they didn't know that that was h
8029,because like that hammer thing when they tuck tukc tuck on your knee and then your knee like flies out and i the doctor wants because of that but like if they're testing are reflexible like reflexive things,cause like that hamer thing when they ta on your nee and then you'r neel like flies out and i t t doctor once because that but like it' thei're testinur reflectibleflect reflective o things
8030,probably the colorful wings because the predators might think oh no it might be poisonous because of their bright colorful pattern,probably the collorful wings because the progtors might think oh no we might be poliin its because of the bright colorfu ptter

8034,now with hands like woo and the brains like that's hot that's hot that's hot and they when he touches it immediately the century neurons have the motor neurons that's a hot and it bring it away really quick,oh the hands like w and it breains like that's hop that's hp tht that's haght and then when he touches it and imedeatly the sencring your ons how the moter yeron i's a heart and i bring it away really clic
8035,the mouth is where the very part first part of the digestive system starts it's when your saliva just starts to break down the food and swallow both pieces,the mouth is were the very part first part of that justiistom starts it's werng yur sulive at just starts to break down the food into th spallible pieces
8036,showing us a complex like thing of nerves that sends constantly thing from thing from thing so we can think,join as ta complex music like thing of nerves that sinds constantly thing from things from things so we can think
8037,been studying a lot about the human digestive system,en studying a lawt about the human dijustics ist
8038,this is a digestive system of a butterfly and a human the they almost are pretty much the same except smaller for the butterfly and larger for the human,this this is that digestic cistom of a butterfly and a human the  they almost are pretty much to saym except smaller for the butterfly and larger for the hu
8039,the intestines break down the parts that even the stomach can't get into just pure nutrients so the uhm little cells can have them and get energy,the intestins break down the parts that even the stumic can't get ito just pure new trans so the um little sells can have a ma energy
8040,esophagus does is moves the food down the uhm into the stomach so it can be broken down more,sopphic ist does is moves the food down the um into the stumic so it can be broken down more
8041,i notice that they each have cells,i knoticed that they eat ch he selves
8042,uhm was pushes down pushes down the food into the stomach,um was pushes down the pushes down the food into the stumic
8043,the butterfly because it wouldn't it wouldn't be able to eat and process the food,the butterfly would die because it wouldn't it wouln't be ald to eat and prosscess th food
8044,the digestive system of a butterfly,is they die just thi sistom of a butterfly
8045,i know that muscle cells contrast and expand to help you move,i know that muscye'rselves contrast and expand help you move
8046,i see muscle cells of the leg these muscle cells contract to help you walk run and move,i see muscles selles of the leage these muscles sells contrast to help you walk run and move
8047,both have a digestive system so we can each have they can each eat and dispose of the waste,ok ha digustic sistom so they can each have they can each each and dispose of the wast
8048,yeast is one celled organisms that make up bread and stuff,yeast is one sowd orgonisom that make up bread and stuff
8049,i notice that the human and yeast cells are kind of almost the same,i noticed that the human and ye sells are kind of almost the s
8050,little yeast cells yep that's it well you eat little yeast cells when they're all cooked up,ittle yesells ye that's it it won't you eat little yesells on o cooku
8051,brain cells help you think without them you'd you would die yeah,an sells help you think without them youd y you would die yea
8052,i see all these little cells they're layers and layers that build up the skin and right here it looks pretty big here it's only the length of your skin which is really small,i' see all these little sells theyeare layers and layers that built up the skin and it right here looks pretty big but 'here it's only the length of your skin which is really small
8053,keep you from being cut and like but sometimes they do get that and then white cells come and repair it but that's a whole different thing,keep you from being cut like c but sometimes they do get tat and thewhite salls come to repar it but that's to hol ir front thing
8054,system is about breaking down foods and allowing the body to process them into energy,om is about breaking down foods and allowing the body to prosscess them into energy
8055,breaks down the food even more nut it's still not enough so it has to move onto the intestines,breaks down the food even more but it's still not enough so it has to move onto the intestians
8056,what,whey
8057,looks like it's moving,looks like a c fan
8058,we've been learning about electricity,we've been learning about lectrissity
8059,it would feel really hot and sometimes if you touch it you will burn yourself so yeah it makes us like sweat,it would feel really hot and sometimes if you touch a il burdn yourself so yeah mke us like swe

8113,good bye see you next time i had a great time listening,far sa next time i have a gati snane
8114,you can do stuff,you can do sto
8115,when the circuit goes rounds around and around the flag spins and it gives electricity or if it's a circuit the light bulb lights up,when the circet goes around round and around the flag spitons and it gives alectricity or if it's a circet then uthe light all lights up
8116,it's um it's like,it's um it's mike
8117,that when there's um one d cell it won't work because you need another one to connect the other one but if there's two d cells it will work because it's all connected together,no when there's um one dy sell it doesn't work becse you need another one to connect that one but if there's two d sc it will work because it's all conected together
8118,i described that when i click on it um when it's the opposite it'll work but when it's the same like negative into negative positive to positive it won't work so yeah,i decribed that when i click on it um when it's the oppocit youl work but when is te same like nagnomanto negti poturned positive it won't work s oh yeah
8119,the um that it's harder to connect them,um then it's harder to conectin
8120,um that the wires are connecting to the battery and the other wires connected to the other battery and they're both connecting to the spot where the light bulb is lit,um that the wirsere co condecting to the the battery and the other wise conected withe other batter and the're both conecting t the spot where the lit blit bul is lit
8121,we've been learning we've been doing about stuff about electricity and stuff,rabon learning would been doing about stuff about electricity and stuff
8122,it's electricity,e lec tust
8123,i'm fine,i'm f
8124,the light lit up,the light lid u
8125,well it um when i click it it actually lits up because it needs all to connect one is not connecting so you have to put another,well it um when i click it it an actualy lits up because it needs all to conect one is not conecting so gifted put another
8126,it's about something that's go around and it's connecting like together connecting and going around and around again and again,it's about something that's go around and's conecting like together conecting and going round and around again and again
8127,there's three of them,thr o teve
8128,and it'll get dim and there won't,and i'lk get dim an the m
8129,it'll still work but the one will get still dimmer so it one will will not work so you might need to change them,i still work but one will get still dimmer so if one will will not work so you might ntd us change that o
8130,it's connecting together like it's going loop de loop and and like a circuit so it's going round and round so and it's like every thing is connected so,it's conecting togetlike  it's going looptloilike to circt so i' going around anround so and it's like eevery thing is conected so
8131,it keeps getting dimmer like one bulb will keep getting dimmer and dimmer and dimmer so,it keeps getting dimmer like one bulbell keep getting dimmer and dimmer and dim or so
8132,that means electricity are going on and on like a circuit,ta means electriscity are going on and on like a circu
8133,i don't,i do'
8134,it has to be complete circuit,has to be complet circu
8135,that it lights up so it's electricity that it lights up,that it lights u e it's an electricity that lights u
8136,i did it,i d
8137,it's don't say you you're talking about d cell as a source don't say that back um i think it is that,it' don't say y talking lo o te surs don't say that back um i think it is tha
8138,i don't know really,don't know reall
8139,i don't,i don'
8140,i said electricity,a lectr said da ya yaa ya y
8141,like if you connect the wires down to the,like if you connict the wires down to
8142,it means that it leads you to something,it means that it leads you to some thing
8143,a light bulb two wires and a d cell,a light bubg two wires and an de sel that

8154,what can you say the same thing again please,what can you say the same thing again plea
8155,good,good
8156,it has to connect and it has to be sunny,it has to can tha and it has to be studdygetm
8157,open,oh ben
8158,the flag start stops to spin because these two wires are not connected but when it's closed it's like connected so everything's going around in circles,i the flag start stops to spin because these two wires are not conected but what it's closed it's like connected so everything is going around in the circle
8159,can we go on the next step,cant we go on the next da
8160,bye you're a great teacher again and i hope there's a next step because we have to go and we're getting late and yeah bye and i'm gonna miss you and i'm gonna do this at home and yeah,by you're a great teacher again and i hope thre's the next step because we have to go and er getting light and yeah by and i want to mis  and i int to do this o horm and ye
8161,it would stop spinning and we don't have electricity anymore so yeah,it would stop spinning and we don't have to look to se anymore so ye
8162,i don't know okay i'm answering this and you're not listening,i don't kno ok i'm actanswering this and you're not lessthan
8163,that means it has to have power and yeah it's the electricity's going on and on everywhere yeah yeah,that means it has to have power and uh yah it's the electricity is going on and on everywhere yeaa
8164,i'm seeing that the flag is not moving,i'm saying that the flag is not moin
8165,there's no electricity,there's no lactt
8166,the switch has to close and then it starts to spin and when it's not closing it stops okay now can we go to the next question and don't say sorry just go with the next step,swish hes yo close and then insarch os spin and whits nout closing it stops ok et can we go do the ext cept you're asing mean the same question and it don't say sory ut go n te next da
8167,that there's no electricity anymore,that there's no electrity any mor
8168,if you connect a bar to the another thingy the flag starts to spin,if you condect e bard to the another thinging the flag starts to spind
8169,it's doing it's doing,it's doing it's doing lect
8170,that that the i don't really understand i want to repeat,thatthat the um i don't really understand i want ta repe
8171,that one the flag spins that means that that electricity is going on,that when the f flag spins that means that the electrisity is going on a
8172,i have been doing lots of stuff now hurry,i've been doing lots of stuff now harry
8173,but now can we go to like the practice thingy and the test because i have to,but deck can we go to the lilip practicing ye in the test because i have to h
8174,because the it's like going around and round but when it's when it's open when it's open it like it's not,because the um it's like going around around but when it's open when it's open ar when it's open it lenk it's not conect
8175,when the bar does not connect to this it doesn't the flag doesn't spin,when the bar does not cnup to this it doesn't the flag doesn't spin
8176,there's sun and those that thing is hitting the sun so the wires are hitting the electricity and the flag is spinning,tssun and no that thing is hitting the sun so the wirs are hitting the electricity and the flag os spin
8177,flag starts to spin,flag starts the sp
8178,that everyone has electricity,that everyone has an lectricity
8179,that it should be spinning that thingy should be spinning flag thingy should be spinning,that it should be spinning the thing he should be spinning ha flaggy thing e should be spinning
8180,it can be electricity and i keep saying that because it is electricity,it can be alectriscity and ten keep saying that because it in as a exao
8181,that means it's open and yeah it's open and so it's not connected it's not connected so it can't spin,that means it's open and um yes open and um so it's not connected it's not conected so it getsb

8207,i've been learning about electricity,i've been learning about electriscity
8208,because maybe the source means d cell,because maybe the source means t se
8209,the d cell is going in the light,the dsell is going in lit
8210,a light bulb battery and wires,a white bub a battery and wiers
8211,it's about giving light to our earth and room,it's about giving light to our arandroom
8212,maybe it means that it's the pathway of the light bulb,maybe it means the it's the pathway of the light ball
8213,the d cell's floating into the d,the dee sails floating into the deea
8214,it makes the light bulb light up,it makes the light follow light up
8215,that you shouldn't have the wire on the top,that you should have the wire on the top
8216,that the electricity's going on and on,that the lectricity s going on and on
8217,the force of light so it makes the light bulb light up,the force of um light so it makes the light ball light up
8218,it flows by going on and on,it flows t ging ah on
8219,the d cell of the battery,the decelt of ther battery
8220,it lights off the light bulb,it lihtes off the light bal
8221,can you say that again,can you say that again
8222,maybe maybe the d cell is the same as the force,maybe um maybe the desaill is the same as the for
8223,maybe it receives light back to us,maybe it receieves light back to us
8224,the top and the bottom will make the if you connect the wires to the top and the bottom in the correct place it will light up,the top in the bottom will make the if you condect the wires to the top in the bottom in the corect place it will lighe
8225,if you light up the bulb and like give us light and we can see me and it receives light to us so,if you light up the ball and light give us light and we can see more an it receves light to us so
8226,electricity,electrisity
8227,therefore making the light bulb on,therefore making the white ball b o
8228,it looks like it's melting a little bit,it looks like an smelting a little bit
8229,well you can hear the sound pretty thump thump of the drum,well you can hear the sun beti the tump of the job
8230,it's a candle and a fire on top of it,'s a a candle and a fire on top
8231,what,le
8232,what excuse me can you say that again same word please i missed it so can you please say that for me,wkese me ki s t romic do say what please fi  ne dia sa canyu   ne
8233,because it gives us light and it and we can see more stuff with it,because it gives us light and it gi and we can see more stuff with it
8234,a girls walking,the girls walk
8235,it's melting so that means the wax is melting so yeah it starts up here and then it starts to melt because of the heat,it's melting so that means the wax is melting so yea iit starts appeare that it strarts the mouths because of the heat
8236,we've been learning about electricity,people learning about lectrisit
8237,well sometimes it sounds like it's burning but sometimes it sounds like nothing,um well sometimes it sounds like it's burninge bat someties it sends inoth nothing
8238,it gives maybe energy,it gives hny exrgy
8239,fine,fin
8240,a person is drumming,um a person is drumming
8241,sorry i have to go bye,sory at coob
8242,i'm seeing the candles moving a little bit,onsne the candles moving  thet
8243,electricity maybe or fire,lectricity may be over fr
8244,you're using your energy to use your hands and play the drum,you're using you'r anagy to use your hands an play the dram
8245,what does evidence mean again,what does ever did ine again
8246,well the fire's heat makes stuff melt like this the candle wax,well the fires heat makes stuff out like this the candal lack
8247,can you say that one more time please,l can you said that one more time ple
8248,no,no
8249,you already asked me this but walking and eating an apple,your axilly dis but by walking onhe eating an apbl
8250,the flag won't spin so yeah,the flag won't spin so
8251,um i meant electricity or something like they're connected together so it can happen,graam i ment electricity or something like they're conected together so i ca'h an
8252,that means it won't it's not connected to go together so it won't spin like it's not in a complete circuit,that mean there won't it's not conected to go together so it won't spin like a clat in a complit
8253,it should make a pathway like going around and around and please say i'm thinking like a scientist because i,intssred meake a path way alike going around around and please say i'm thinking like a scientitt because
8254,because like it's connected together so if it's outside if it's like um not connected it won't spin,becausse i it's conected together so if it's  outsides if it's like'm not conected it won't been
8255,electricity maybe,ectimaybe
8256,the flag starts to spin because it's a complete circuit now so,the flag starts o spining because it's a comlet circet now so
8257,sorry i didn't hear you,sor y didn't hear yo
8258,the the metal thingy is like out of it's place it's not like straight so the flag's not,the te middale dinke is a out of its place it's not like straight so the flag s no
8259,that when i when it's like inside it go the flag spins but when it's like broken like it's crooked it's like outside it doesn't spin,that ik when it's like inside it go i the flag spins that one is like broken like it's cricked ik outside it doesn't sp
8260,electricity,lectricity
8261,can you please say that again,can you please say that again
8262,the bar is like in it's place like it's straight so the flag is,the bar is a in its place like it straght so the flag is
8263,they're connected together so it um the flag is spinning,they're connected together so it cand the flag is spitting
8264,that metal thingy has to get inside,the medtal thing he has to get insid
8265,good,could

8287,i don't know,i don't know
8288,the light bulb wouldn't light up anymore,the light ball wouldn't lighte up anymore
8289,they're about to they're all about um to make they're making the light like light the light bulb light up,they're about to they're all about um to make the'r making the light like light the light ball light up
8290,the source is like the source of the d d cell would be,this oris like the source of the deep d sell
8291,right there like in the middle and the side,right there like the middle in the s
8292,it's like a path that leads you somewhere like it leads you somewhere like,it's like a path at leads you somewhere ik at wed o somewhrlike
8293,i've been learning about electricity,i've bee learning by alectriscit
8294,they are this is um a bulb this is two wires and this is d cell or a battery,they are this is m a bull this is two wires and this is desell or battery
8295,they um they help us like do make electricity with the,they um theyhelp us like do make ellectr citty with the b
8296,i didn't get what you were saying,i didn't get what you ere silly
8297,a lot of people use in the metric system people use milliliters to measure liquid,a lot of people use in the metric sistom people use mellow leaters to measure liquid
8298,we,w
8299,yes i am,yes i am
8300,the soda cans said that it had three hundred and fifty five milliliters of soda in it but it actually had three hundred eighty millimeters of soda,this soata can said that it had three hundred fifty five milon leters of soant but it actually had three hundred eigty more meaters of soata
8301,yes,yes
8302,well you can um watch the news and see what the temperature will be or find it on the computer but so and also you can um use the thermometer,ell you can um watch the news and see what the tempereature will be or find it on the computer but s malso you can um use the thermometer
8303,we are studying temperature in degrees celsius which is the metric system,we are studdying temperature and degre sals es wich is the matgric asktom
8304,celsius is the metric system for how to measure temperature,suciis is the metric sistom for how to measure temperature
8305,temperature is to measure how hot or cold it is,temperature is to measure how ht ir cold  us
8306,for example you add twenty two and six to get twenty eight instead of subtracting twenty two minus negative six,for example you ad twenty two and six to get twenty eight instead of subtracting twenty two mines neggutve six
8307,i'm fine,i'm fine
8308,yes a fifteen minute change,yess say fifteen minute change
8309,like the other graph like the graph if you put in ice the temperature drops,like the other graft liked the graff if you put an ice the tempeature drops
8310,i think fifty,i think fifty
8311,wait the graduated cylinders measure to one h to fifty milliliters and they're in in the shape of a cylinder,but they gratuated the inders measure to one two fifty millleatrs and therent in the shape o a selender
8312,today we were finding out if the soda company was cheating us um and giving us less soda than we paid for,to day we were finding out if the soate company was treating us um and giving us less sort of them we paid for
8313,i i'm fine,i'm i'm fine
8314,yes that is correct,yes that is correct
8315,what does that mean,what does that mean
8316,the graduated cylinders measure,the gratuated sellenders measure
8317,the the french people made it and everyone bought it and uses it except for the united states,ghe friench people made it and everyone bought it and uses it except for the unites states
8318,to get all the energy from the leaf out into the sides of the leaf so the plan can grow,e to get all the energy from the leaf out into the sides of the leaf so the plant could gro
8319,it's like a,it's like a
8320,a palmate,a pollmate
8321,a pennate leaf,ap fetherdlea
8322,well because all the veins are they will not intersect in any way,well because all the vaines are they will not intersect in anyway
8323,the leaves because leaves when photosynthesis occurs it makes water vapor,the leaves because leaves when photo cimtheciaccurs it um  makes water vaper
8324,we are learning about leaves now as a leaf so,we are learning about leash and that is a leaf so

8392,well light bulbs help you a lot because if it's raining or something you can like turn on the light bulb and it will be like dark or anything,well um the light balbs help you a law because if it's raining or something you can m turn on a light ball band it will be dark or anyth
8393,i noticed that when i pushed the d cell it turned around so that the minus sign is now giving energy to the light bulb and the plus sign is getting the energy from the other wire,i noticed that when i pushe the deesal it turneds around so that the miner side is no giving energy to the light bolb and the plusigte is getting the energy from the other
8394,i don't know,i don't know
8395,wires you can't like if there's a battery i mean if you had wires you could maybe put the wires next to the battery and it'll give the light bulb some energy,wires you can't like if there's a battery  y if you had a wires you could mabe put the wires next to the battery and i'll give the light balp some anerd

8426,well i don't think it's gonna work because gas isn't a source of energy,well i don't think it's going to t work because gass isn't a sourc of anodream
8427,it's heating up the wax and showing off,it's heading up the wax and show ing up
8428,because um the coal has been burned and the gas hasn't i guess,frmk because um the cool has been burned and the gass hasn't again
8429,i see the candle and the little black yarn is has a fire and the fire's melting the was and the was is going it's once dripped,i see the candle and the little black yarn is has a fire and the fires melting the wax in the wax is going down it'soncs dripp

8442,no body and can i put to use just with what is,oh marne and can i please just itus  uch
8443,because it doesn't work,cause it's te to wor
8444,because the switch is,because the litch is outc t t two t
8445,it breaks,tit break
8446,i see that light bulb is not working because the switch is in on is like holding the electricity is going through light bulb,i see that the lie bois not woring because a swish is an nis like holding the alectricity f for going to the lih b
8447,i noticed that it doesn't work anymore because one of the light bulbs,ani've noticed that uit doesn't work anymore because one of the li bops
8448,series circuit,reesearc
8449,we really it doesn't work anymore because like well what are light bulbs does work but the other one,u  it dosn't work anymore because theke well one of the lie barms does work but o ther would
8450,we had seen a series circuit and a parallel circuit,eceen a s reserg and a pea
8451,light is,ringin wy is
8452,i will not know actually,um i don't not know actually
8453,it will work anymore because it's like that strategies hold back,oh it won't work any more because te slike sike tat the ennergy is hold back
8454,because the switch is in because the switch is in there,because the swish is't because the swish isn't there
8455,to that current stops,pil the curt stops
8456,i don't know,i don't know
8457,a series,a thery
8458,i think that the battery,i think that the batter
8459,may it doesn't work or really the other one doesn't work,maybe it doesn't workcor b eah other ote doesn't work
8460,a parallel circuit,up teawell backgat
8461,i don't know,i don't know
8462,light bulb grow so it doesn't work so that it has to be different another,opll broke so tdodsn't work so th en it hasn't change for ont of te
8463,may be because it's getting too much light,ame because's getting to muchlight
8464,you know that is,note that
8465,we know that there is a battery that this three wires there is a switch,we know that there s a battery and that there's three wieres is the switch
8466,i don't know,i don't know
8467,of the battery,ars a the battery
8468,that one of the light bulbs broke,that what a the lipe bolls brok
8469,the light the two light bulbs are lighting because the other one is broken and then what they do what they will was it doesn't work,adose it u delight the two light bubs are lighting because tther o is broken and then let the do wiwhat to do whe it doesn work
8470,there were the light bulbs were lighting but there is the other one broke as they did a stuff light i get that they got it other one and it started lighting and that,u they were the lipebls were lighting but then the other one broke and they didn't  sop lightingain then they caught o dother one and it started lighting a gain
8471,break,brak
8472,bulb starts working because like with the switch was out it was hold that energy from the light bulb,up started t working because like when the swish was out it was holding the ennergy back from the lihe bal
8473,work anymore because it's standard is doesn't work,work anymore because it's steaded it's doesn' wor
8474,it's not a complete circuit,is not a compleet circcu
8475,the flow the electricity is going through all three wires,um the flot is that lector is going to all the three wires
8476,there is a switch for a new one,u beayinggus swishin for a new one
8477,any more this can no light getting,bore it and there no ge
8478,any more,the more
8479,would you speak a light is party,at a string a like es barny
8480,series circuit,fary cer
8481,see that i had received a parallel circuit a series circuit,ceeo i' ceen a parl circet a firy circet
8482,we've been learning how to complete a circuit,we've ben learning how a complet suirce
8483,so,so
8484,insulators are helpful,anslaters areare healthful
8485,its starts to move because it's like like happy its energy,it starts to move because it's like like happy it's getting an er
8486,i see that the motor is moving because when i put the paper clip on top of the switch it started to move,i see that the motor is moving because will not put the piper clip on top of thi swi jus started to move
8487,because it's not a source of electricity or a piece of energy,because it's not a sorts of acity por a piece of t
8488,good,a
8489,the motor is moving its little flag because the switch is turned on,the motor is moving its little flag because thes swish is turned
8490,the circuit will run because it is like its metal and in order for it towards that needs metal,the circet will run because it's linke it's medal and in order for it to work int needs meddal
8491,all inside it and then it want,pule iecided and then they won't
8492,i mean that is not getting energy because the switch is at on and the wood stick is like isn't a type of metal so it won't work,it means that is not getting energy because the swish is an on and the wood stick is a nake isn't a type of mettal so itit won't wor
8493,conducting materials are helpful but the rest of that aren't where it's to other way over can you tell that marnie,um conducting materls or helphful but the rest of them aren't or it's the other way round can you tell me that moreni
8494,that when you put the wood on the wood stick it is not working anymore because it's not type of metal or its type of source to make it,that when you put the wood woold um the wood stick it isn't working anymore because it's not a type of mettal or i type of source to make it
8495,it doesn't work because it's not like store of energy and because a battery works because that has stored energy inside it so,it doesn't work because it's not a sore of anergy and  because a battery works because it has o energy inside it so
8496,i said that you need a battery which has stored energy inside it and then you need two wires a switch and a motor,i um said that you need a battery witch hestlled energy inside it and then um you need two wirs of swish and moter
8497,well i think that the light the dots are the energy and like that's was just speaking the light bulb brighter,well um i think that the lak the dogs are the energy and th tha was making a ligh al iter
8498,it's just to be in a circle is very helpful because they has because the battery is giving in energy to the d cell that's how the light bulb is getting the energy improvement,tstoyanoh tircat is very helpful because it has because it the batteris givting m energy to the decail ness of the toof light bolb is getting the energy and worm out
8499,i don't know,i don't know
8500,that when those one light bulb it just one focus and like when there is a one battery it doesn't light as much as the second one because there is two for each one,bat when there's one like ball it's just one folk is and tlike when there's one battery it doesn't light as much as the second one because there's stup or each one
8501,its it was the light bulbs turn brighter because it's using two batteries and so that is two stored energies into light bulbs,it's um it was the lighe bobsturned brighter because it's using to betteryes and so the is cuzed toed in her cheeth in to lighe bulbs
8502,there are one two three four there is four path ways to a series circuit,there are one two three four there's four path way two a serious circu
8503,i think the work may be,um i think yu work maybe
8504,the energy stored in that because it's giving energy to the light bulbs,um the energy is stwored and stuff because it's giving energy to the lypeblbs
8505,i think the light bulbs are going to be brighter because it's using to tube a d cells and like they have stored energy so it will work,d i think the ligh bobs are going to be brighter because it's using to to um desells and like they have sorto annergy so itwork
8506,can you repeat that,ei iv you ru
8507,flow in like the battery and it has to has to go through the light bulb the wires the d cell as to go through light has to go through it has lot of things,flow in like the battery and it ha to wu t have to go through the lve bub the wires the d sell hae to go through lie tit have to go toh aire ant hase to go thogh a lot of thing
8508,i think that is the wire is getting energy and its going into the light bulbs so the little blue dots are like the energy coming,i think that is the the wiere s getting energy and it's going into the life of so the little blue dos are like the eanergy coming
8509,it's to be touching d cell and the wires because the wires are going to gain energy and by that one is going to be like a really fun and stuff like that so just get on the last part,s to be toutching thes sell in the wieres because the wyse an t help begit um and hert and by thea worm it's  be like really fun and sto lik a id just gess on the lest part
8510,because they needs another wire connecting to the plus of the wires and there are not supposed to be touching,because it needs another wire condecting to the plis of the wires and they daren't suppose to be touching
8511,connecting the series circuit like it would not be the bright anymore well it will be bright because it's only used i think it won't work and i think really work light bulbs,being thes cerious togtik it w it would not be that bright anymore well it will be bright because it's only usi think it won't work and i t we will work but  light ball o
8512,may be because if the wires are the battery is giving energy to the wire and that's why the light bulb is shining and its very very very very bright,um maybe because if the wires ur the batter's giving eanergy to the wires and that's whay the lighe bob is shining and it's very very very re youright
8513,he is a complete format for a light bulb to work,it is a compleet ormat for a ligh bal work
8514,it's like the energy is giving the energy it's called to the light bulb and that's how its giving energy i guess,it's like the ennergy is giving the o c it's go to the liht bolb and that's how it's doing eannergy i asked
8515,that the energy flowing,the the energy is flowing

8675,yes,yes
8676,the battery is a always holds energy until it runs out,the battery its  always hold anegntil it runs hou
8677,there's energy in the battery and it flows through the wire to the light or the motor and then flows back,there's energy in the battery and it flows through the waitr to the light or the moer and then flots back
8678,what,what
8679,when i clicked on the d cell the motor went the other way,when i clicked on the dsell the moter went the other way
8680,energy turns on the motor or the light bulb,energy turn on the moter or the white bulb
8681,that's how you light up these lights,il te you light up these lghts
8682,what do you mean,what do you mean
8683,the electrons aren't flowing through because the switch is off and the switch is the metal rod,the lectrns arent flowing through because the swish is off and the swish is the medale rock
8684,the black lines going up and over other wires,the black lines going up and over are te wie
8685,electricity flows through it which ac which activates the motor the light bulb and other stuff,eletrissity flots through it which ac which activats the motor the light balb another stuff
8686,and a light bulb,and a light balb
8687,yes,yes
8688,the thing that my mouse is on is called a base,the thing that my mouth is on is called base
8689,the d cell in that e in that holder in the base,deesell in that n that holder in the base
8690,good,good
8691,tell m tell you about what,tom tell you about what
8692,um the motor turns the other way,um the moter turns  the ther way
8693,if it wasn't in the electrons would stop and the electricity wouldn't flow through the whole thing,if it wast in the te lec trans would stop and the lectriscity wouldt flow though the whole thing
8694,no you need more than one wire,no you need more than one waier
8695,s i do,i do
8696,the light bulb isn't lighting up um because the switch is e in,the light ball isn't laying up um because the swish is in in
8697,precisely,preocicely
8698,two if you're not using the switch,to if you're not using the switch
8699,e and if you want the motor put in the h mo,and if you want the moter put in the mu
8700,the energy on always goes out the negative side,the energy win't always go without the neggotive side
8701,yes,yes

8729,um the electrons are flowing into the motor and i think they're going in the circle and back out,um the lectrans are flowing into the moternd i think they're going in the circle and backout
8730,when the energy collects into the light bulb it lights up,when the energy collects into the lighe bob it light sup
8731,that's a wi,that's a w
8732,it says there that's a battery,it says there that's a bator
8733,it should light up,it should light u
8734,okay,just
8735,no it's there's it's still going through,no it's dishe it's stillon thin
8736,it's not working there's no light bulb,it's not working there's no white ball
8737,the battery's connected to the light bulb and the wire which is connected to that i have no idea how circuits c how charges can the flow through this no idea,the batteryes connected to the light bolb and the wire which is connected t that and have no idea how circets cahavcharges can te flow through this no idea
8738,mmm it's still working charges are still going through,i stil wkin charges are still gone through

8746,um we were learning about electricity,um we were learning about what trisi te
8747,it they went this way before and then,i they  this wy before an
8748,it's they're still flowing i think yeah,it's they're still flowing i think eah
8749,it goes through here lights up the bulb and goes back,a gost thugh here likes up the ball and goes back
8750,n the charges are flowing yeah,they chargers are flowing a yah
8751,that's positive that's negative,that's poive that's neggitive
8752,um it lets them flow if there's a break in the wire the charges would stop,uhm it lets them flow if there's a break in the wier the charges would stop
8753,the circuits are going from here into here over that and through here yeah charges,the circuts are going from here in to here over that and gea chargees
8754,those let it f flow the um it is the charges yeah,those let it flow um it is the chargest
8755,the charges are flowing through it yeah i know so,the charges are floing through it yeh i know  o
8756,okay,k
8757,it can't go the other way,it can't go the other way
8758,the battery,the bat
8759,i see the charges are going up here through here and out there,i see the charges are going up here though here and outthere
8760,um i observed it sliding up,am abssorb it's lying up
8761,um it would stop and the light would go off,um it would stop so it was't and the light would go off

8764,yeah,yeah
8765,um no,no
8766,yeah if you s,yeah if you
8767,uh it's they're going through here and out,u it's thei're gong through here and now
8768,yeah um it lights up,yeh i um it lights so some
8769,um we used a battery and we connected wires to it and then we connected wires to um a light bulb to light it up mmm hmm,um we used a battery and we connected wires tot and then we connected wires to um a lighe ball to like it up m
8770,no no no no,n't tinkeseanoennn
8771,okay,k
8772,yeah mmm hmm wait,yea what that looks like and
8773,um that,uhm that

8783,i've i've been working with electricity,i've i've been working with lectriity
8784,that is the receiver yeah yeah,that is the recever a kind of excitniml sor that gets autah
8785,oh they go the other way yeah yeah,oh they go of their way yeahyeah
8786,um it gives it energy and lights up,um it gives it an argy and lits up
8787,yeah,yeah
8788,wire,wire
8789,the charges go from the negative to here then back to the battery,they charge just go from the negg da ty hear then back to the batter
8790,um i don't know,um i don't kno
8791,because there's no way they can get through the the thing,because there's no way they can't get through the the thing
8792,um mmm i don't know,m i don't know
8793,it wouldn't matter that would go it would,it wouldmathat wouldgo it would
8794,it won't work cause it's not connected to that so that means the f flows won't be able to go up and over and in the battery,it won't work cause  not connected to that to that means the flows wuln't be able to go up and obern in the bal
8795,this,this
8796,yeah,yeah
8797,hello,heu
8798,oh yeah uh huh yeah,oh yeah yeh
8799,uh huh yeah,reayeh
8800,we connect it here and here,we conected  here and here
8801,yeah,yeah
8802,that there's no marty,that there's no marty
8803,it matters you have to put we put it here only here yeah no one both on the ball,it matters you have to put we put it here only here yeah no one both on the barn
8804,um it's the source of the energy,um it's the source of the eannergy
8805,stop stop stop stop it stop,sto stop stopsopstop
8806,yep,yip
8807,the energy stops flowing,then gtps flui
8808,you just put them together,you just put them together
8809,i didn't underst,i din' under
8810,what why is that your favorite question,what why is that your favorite question
8811,it shows two light bulbs and two batteries,it shows to like buls and two batteryes
8812,yep that's right,yep that's right
8813,now there's more energy,nd ho there s more en
8814,how the energy flows through them,how the energy flows ee them
8815,stuck up please,stuck op please
8816,i kind of worked on it,a kind of worked on
8817,oh about what,about what
8818,because the two positive sides are going together,because the two pausdiv sides are going together
8819,like what,like what
8820,yeah,ye
8821,when i clipped on the batteries,when ey clicked on the battors
8822,it tells me the bulbs are lighting up because of the energy flo is flo,it tells me the bob dirtle lighting up because of the energy  is fl
8823,why is that your favorite question,why is that your favorite question
8824,what else do you want to know,what all se wine
8825,um hmm that's a hard question um it it can on like i said it can only flow from the negative to the positive,um that's a hard queston um it it can on like i seid it can only flow from the neggotive to the positive
8826,we put two batteries on two bulbs,we put two batteries on two bobs
8827,no but i know it's flowing cause the bulbs are lighting up,no but i knots flung cause bulbs are lying up
8828,hmm we tried to light um a bulb two bulbs with one battery,we tried to like a bub two bubs with one battery
8829,it light dimly,it l dimnye
8830,energy flows in the bulb and wa it lights up,eneagy flows in the balb and it lights up
8831,to make the energy more efficient,to make the annegy more afie
8832,the batteries and the light bulbs,the batteriyes and the white bulbs
8833,no you can't,no you can't
8834,there is a motor light bulb and battery,there's a motor like bulb and better
8835,what tell me,what tell me
8836,can't have two positive ends of a battery together,can't have two ptie ends obatter together
8837,what,what
8838,yep,yip
8839,we put together the batteries then put the wires on then it lit up,we put together the batterriece and then put the wire son then it lit up
8840,what about that,wat about them
8841,what do you mean,what do you mean
8842,good,good
8843,now you see the energy flowing,now you see the anergy flowing
8844,the energy is flowing through the bulbs,the ennergy is flowing through the bus
8845,the energy flows through a wire getting it really really hot which li like which makes light,the energ flows through ha wire g really really hot which l which makes light
8846,it's the light bulbs are turning off,it's that lighe bubs are turning off
8847,what,what
8848,stop,oe lot
8849,like i said it stops flowing,like a said it stops flowing
8850,cause the two batteries holds l they hold a lot of energy put together,cause e're two batteries hold they hold a lat of annergys put together
8851,i've been seeing how ways we can put two light bulbs connected to one battery,hi've been seing how ways we can put two like bulbs connected to one battery
8852,we've understood two positive and negative thing um sides can't go together,we warmed that to pzitive annigtive thik msids can't go together
8853,okay,ok
8854,yep,yup
8855,yeah,yeah

8982,um what,um what
8983,what's special is that one can make the li the two light bulbs bright and the other one can't it makes it a little dim,what special is that one can make thelike the two light bubs right and the other one can't it makes it a little dim
8984,um when one bulb in the parallel circuit goes off then all the other lights stay the same they stay lit,um when one balb in the parellell circet goes out then all the other lights stay the same they stay lit
8985,because if you put it if you put it like a series circuit then when one bulb goes out then all the other lights go out,because if you put it if you put it like a sero circet then when one bob goes out then all the other lights go out
8986,i'm sorry marney um but i just haven't told that i need to go back to my class but i'll see you next time,s marne um but i just have been told that i need to go back to my class but i'll see yu next time

8993,good,k
8994,the magnet's force,the magnets force
8995,okay,orpo
8996,what do you mean,what do you mean
8997,i've been seeing how much weight it takes it er you need to break the force,even sing how much wait takes i  you ned to break the force
8998,and we used a um measure to um we put one,used uhum measure to m we put on
8999,i think it was,i think it was
9000,it's a graph and we can mark it to um the magnet finally um o um just couldn't take it,it's a grass and we can mark it to er um the magnet finally um um just couldn't take it
9001,at m maybe on our board,at may be on our bord
9002,well i it broke because under the weight um it kept getting um heavier and heavier,now it broke because under the weaight um it kept getting um heavier and heavier
9003,um as i put in more washers the force from the magnet is getting weaker and weaker until it finally breaks,um alsa put in more washs the force from the magnet is getting weeker and weeker until it finally breaks
9004,good,good
9005,the washers made it really heavy and the scale turned the other way towards the washers,the wars made it really heavy and the scale turned the other way towards the washers
9006,washers,blasers
9007,well circuit sound of sound kind of sounds like circle so um it's sort of in a circle oval shape the way it goes around,well circlte sound of son kind of sounds like circle so um it's sort of in a circle oble shape te way it goes around
9008,it shows um the symbols,it shows the um the simble
9009,the d cell is um having energy travel through the wires to get to the motor and then traveling out the other end to get back to the d cell,the deesell is um having energy travel through the wires to get to the motor and then traveling out the other end to get back to the deesell
9010,um i think that those are the wires that are connecting to the motor,um i think that those are the wires that are connecting to the motor
9011,it is um charging the motor so the motor goes and that's pretty much it,it is um charging the motor so the motor goes and that's pretty much it
9012,the d ce cell is a energy disputer which um send which the ener which sends energy through the wires,the dees sell is the energy disputer which um sent which the enner which sends the energy through the wires
9013,well the symbol for the battery one side is one line is a little big longer so that probably means that it's the um positive side and the other side is shorter so it probaby means the negative sign,well the simple for the battery one side is one line is a ltle bit longer so that probly means that it's the um positive side and the other side is shorter so it probably means the neggutive sign
9014,those are the wires which the energy travels through to make the motor start,those are the wires which the energy traveled through to make the moter start
9015,um the positive and the negative sides,um the positive and the negotive sides
9016,it is um,it is uhm
9017,um the energy it comes in from one end and go um comes out in the other,um the energy it comes in from one end and gum comes out in the other
9018,um well it charges things,well it charge of things
9019,if they weren't n um next to the m for the motor or the d cell symbol then it wouldn't run,if they weren't um next to the em for the motor or the thesells simples then it wouldn't run
9020,pretty good,pretty good
9021,you have to make it in a s sort of in a circle or else th it won't flow correctly,you have to make it in a sort of in a circle or else th it won't slow correctly
9022,the electricity has to um not be it has to run out for it to,um actually it has to
9023,if you turn it if you by the switch then it sort of turns the electromagnet on sort of like a light bulb,if you turn it if you close this wisch then its sort of turns electrcal magnet on sort of like a light bulld
9024,it is closed,it is closed
9025,then it will work,then it will work
9026,it has to be connected to the electricity,havs to be conected to the lectricity
9027,i don't know,i don't know
9028,until you turn it off,until you turn it off
9029,we have been making um electromagnets,we have been makiging um electrcal magnets
9030,i don't know,i don't know
9031,when it is connected um not incorrectly or when the switch is open,one is connected um not incorectly or when the swish is open
9032,it cuts it off,it cuts it off
9033,i have to go marnie,i have to go morny
9034,well,the lectriscity has to be flowing around or else the ennergy won't reach um the magnet so it won't work
9035,hi marnie,hi'm arady
9036,temporary magnets don't last very long,temperary magnets don't last very long
9037,you can make an electromagnet,you can make an electral magnet
9038,well um you're really um good about talking s um clearly and but you kind of but you're still a little bit choppy,well um you're really um good about talking um clearly and but you kind but you're still a little bit choppy
9039,um we added more well we had spacers and washers as you know and we put the spacers between the magnets and the washers on the other end,um we added more wll we had spacers and wasers as you know and we put the spacers between the magnets and the wasers on the other and
9040,it has too many washers so that the magnets lose their magnetic field,it has too many waters so that the magnets le their magnetic field
9041,we um group a group b and group d have the same results cause they probably did the same thing and group c has really low um,um group a gru and groupt have the same result because they probly did the same thing and group  has really low um
9042,getting further apart,are getting further apart
9043,well they had better um,well they had better um
9044,yeah because there was such a big drop like from nineteen nine that's ten washers so th the spacers must have a a lot of use,yeah because it was such a big drop like from ninetteen  nine that's ten washers so the sspacers must have had l a lot of yuth
9045,they're sticking together,they a're sticking together
9046,i'm good,i'm good
9047,yeah they're really fun especially the messy ones,ya they're really fun especially the mscy ones
9048,we have been um we have been testing the strength of the magnets,we have ben um we have been testing the strength ofd magnets
9049,magnets get further apart because the more um spacers you put in between the um less room they have,maggnets get further upart because the more um spacers you put im between the um less room d they have
9050,they should do the same things,they should do the same things
9051,washers were heavy and they made the magnets lose their strength,waters were heavy and they made the magnets les their strength
9052,yeah because then it would kind of um hit the cup and then the magnets would kind of separate because of the force and then they would come back together,yeah because then it would kind of um hit the cup and then the magnets would kind of seppeorate because of the forest and then they would come back together
9053,it's broken because um the washer's thrown in there so hard that it kind of forces that cup down and the other cup to come with the magnet to separate from the other magnet,it's broken because um the waser is thrown in theyre so hard that it kind of forces that cup down and the other cup to come with the magnet to sepperate from the other magnet
9054,the magnetic the magnets get weaker and weaker as the washers get as the more washers get in the other cup,the magneti the magnets get weeker and weeker as the waters get as the more water s get in the other cup
9055,c didn't,sede
9056,you need to follow the directions or whatever you're being told to do correctly or else you'll get really different results,you need to follow the directions or whatever you're being told to do correctly or else you'll get really different results
9057,if you don't follow the directions or whatever then you won't get the same results as maybe the other people who are doing it right,if you don't follow the directions or whatever then you won't get the same result as maybe the other people who are doing it right
9058,i answered that already,i answered that already
9059,well the there's the base the wire the c d cell or the source and the light bulb the receiver and the wire the pathway,will the there's the bace the wire the sdesails are source and the light buld teever and the wire  the pathway
9060,the d cell um is the energy part um the wire carries the energy to the light bulb and the light bulb makes the electricity,the deesail um is the energy part um the wiair carries the energy to the light bulb and the light buld makes  electricity
9061,well they attach to the magn to i mean to the um,
9062,i see a d cell a light bulb um really small light bulb and some wire,i see a desell a light bulb m really small ligte bulb and some waiter
9063,pretty good,pretty good
9064,i it's kind of like a root,i it's kind of like a root
9065,well today we um we made an electromagnet and a lot most of our class got electricity,well today we um we made an electral magnet and a lot most of our class got electrissity
9066,it's the um energy source that travels through the wire to create the electricity,it's the um anergy source that travels through the waire to creat the lelectrissity
9067,um there are only two,um the're only two
9068,then uh the other one will burn out as well as the other one,then the other one will burn out as well as the other one
9069,then they all burn out sort of like how uh um bunch of houses i if one light if one house burns out and if it's and it's a series circuit then all of the houses will burn out,then they all burn out sort of likhe  ha u um bunch of houses if one like if one house burns out and if it' and it's a sery circet then all the houses will burn out
9070,um with only two light bulbs,um with only two light bulbs
9071,a parallel circuit because if one bulb lights out burns out then the others will still light,a pairellell turcute because if funbl blights out burns out then the others will still light
9072,um because they're both pretty much connected to the um d cell,um because they're both prty much connected to the um desell
9073,one is a series circuit and another is a parallel circuit,one is a serys circut and another isha parellell circut
9074,um it has to travel through both light bulbs before it gets back to the battery,um it has to travel through both light bolds before it gets back to the battery
9075,um it's important because if one light bulb burns out then it doesn't affect the other light bulb,o it's importan't because if one light bull burns out then it doesn't effect the other light bold
9076,well the pathways are pretty much sort of two pathways because um they go through one light bulb instead of having to travel through the whole um circuit,well the pathways are pretty much sort of two pathways because um they go through one light boll instead of having to travele through the whole um circet
9077,the one on the right side is sort of separate from the other one,the one on the right side is sort of sepprit from the other one
9078,today we made electromagnets but ours didn't work,today we made electral magnets but ours didn't work
9079,a parallel circuit,a parelell circut
9080,um the light bulb on the right is burned out,um the light bollb on to right is burned out
9081,well one thing is that this is a probably a parallel circuit because when i clicked on one of the light bulbs the other one didn't burn out,well one thing is that this is a probably a paralell circet because when i clicked on one of the light bolbs the other one didn't burn out
9082,today we made electromagnets but ours didn't work probably because we had a dead battery,today we made electral magnets but ours didn't work probably because we had a dead battery
9083,if one of the light bulbs burn out oh then um none of the light bulbs will light up,if one of the light blls burn out u then um non of the light bulls will light up
9084,um it is a series circuit so the light bulbs didn't burn very bright,um iwas a sery circet so the light bulbs didn't burn very bright
9085,yes i have,yes i have
9086,then the energy can't flow through to the to the light bulb so um the light bulb cannot light up,then the energy can't flow through t to the light bolom so um the light buld cannot light up
9087,hi marnie,marny
9088,it has to be in um it doesn't matter which um it doesn't matter which brad which wire goes on which brad just as long as it's the correct brad,it has to be in um it doesn't matter which um it doesn't matter which bra which wire goes on which brad just as long as it's the correct bread
9089,brads,breads
9090,i need,i ne
9091,things,things
9092,we just finished uh lighting up two light bulbs with one battery in class right n a couple of minutes ago,we just finished um lighting up two lighte bulbs with one battery in  class ritng a couple of minutes ago
9093,i'm good,i'm good
9094,good bye,goodbye
9095,marnie it's time for me to go,marnis time for me to go
9096,because then they will burn brighter,because then they will burn brighter
9097,the electricity doesn't have to pass through another bulb it can just go straight back to the battery so it is very good,the electricity doesn't have to pass through another bullb it can just go straight back to the battery so it is very good
9098,um there are two,umthere are two
9099,hi marnie,i'm arny
9100,yeah,yeah
9101,the,th
9102,well actually they only have one energy source because that is the d cell but they have two different wires that connect to the d cell so they can both light up the exact same amount,w'll actually they only have one anergy sours because that is the deesell but they have two different wirs that conect to the deesell so they can both light up e exact same amount
9103,they are about using one d cell or battery to make two different light bulbs light up,they are about using one desal or battery to make two different light bulbs light up
9104,yeah that that whe that uh left is the way that uh,and ththat want that left is the way that ah
9105,um well we knew that we'd try the halfway point at twenty first and if that went too far we'd start going lower and then we figured out the halfway point was seventeen,um well we knew that wed try to halve way point at twenty first and if that went too far we'd start going lower and then we figured oup the half way point was seventeen
9106,um you need a certain amount of twist which is forty yeah mmm hmm um the string you have to have it on the string,um you need a certain amount of twist which is forty yeh mum this string you ave to have it on the string
9107,yeah,yah
9108,it's sometimes confusing cause we don't know when to change em or when to keep em the same,it's sometimes comfusing cause we don't know wind to change him or win to keep him the same
9109,yeah,yeeah
9110,yeah,yeah
9111,when you added more passengers,when you added more passengers
9112,mmm hmm yeah,od wi a eah
9113,yeah,vah
9114,yeah mmm hmm yeah,yeah s yea
9115,how far it would go with two passengers and then four passengers and so on,how far it would go with two passengers then four pasengers and so o
9116,um maybe the it'd be another speed one but it wouldn't be with the fan it'd be with more propellers,um maybe the it be another speed one but it wouldn't be with he fan in b with more preopellers
9117,uh because it's half of forty,uh because it's half a forty
9118,uh well because if you change two variables at the same time it might not go out go as well as you predicted it would,u well because if you change two veriables at the same time it might not go out go as well as you proticted it would
9119,it made it go slower because of the weight on the plane,it made it go slower because of the wiht on the plane
9120,yeah cause,yeeah
9121,forty,forty
9122,uh sort of we are figuring out how to fly an airplane on a string,a sort of we aure figuring ou had to fly an airplane on a string
9123,uh yeah,uh yeah
9124,maybe the speed cause we i have a friend who is doing like a f six meter one,maybe the speed cause we i have a friend who is doing like a six meetor one
9125,uh when the plane actually flew across the string cause i didn't think it'd even get an inch,uh when the plane actually flew across the stringx i didn't think i'd even git an inch
9126,yeah,yeah
9127,um because they knew that it was gonna get a lot more speed with the fan,u because they knew that it was going to get a lot more speed with the fan
9128,mmm hmm yeah,yeh
9129,we wanted to see the halfway point and all the other points on the strings,we want to see the halfway point and all the other points on the string
9130,uh well we tried to we figured out the halfway point and the,uh well we tried to we figured out the half way point and the
9131,uh well we put it on wrong so or i twisted it wrong and so when i twisted it one way it started going backwards,uh well we put it on wrong so ere i twisted it wrong and so when i twisted it one way it started going backwards
9132,yeah mmm hmm,yeeah m
9133,uh they are like the standard thing that makes it fly or in what you need to make it fly,uh they are like the standard thing that makes it fly air an what you need to make it fly
9134,yeah,yeahh
9135,te,t
9136,mmm that we c um,that re um
9137,that it goes backwards when you twist it and right is the way it goes forward yeah yeah,that it goes backwards when you twist it and right is the way it goes forward eah
9138,uh well because we couldn't really change that s yet and so we just kept it you at the time you could only change one variable and so,u well because we couldn't really change that yet and so we just kept it you at the time you could only change one veriable  sa
9139,and then our standard was we didn't really have any passengers so when we put more passengers on we changed the variables a lot,and then our standerd was we didn't really have any passengers so when we put more passengers on we changed the veriable alot
9140,we changed like one part of the whole standard thing,we change like one part of the hole standerd thing
9141,yeah,yeah
9142,it really just affected it a lot because usually without e with the same amount of weight that it had before it kept it on the same thing,it really just effected it a lot because usually without with the same aount away that it had before it kept it on the same thing
9143,hi,high
9144,er no it made it not as go not as far,or no it mae it not  sgo not as far
9145,uh well we just used the standard propeller speed,uh will we just use this sanderd popeller speed
9146,we just ha we had to change the amount of spins for the propeller yeah or else it wouldn't get across at all,we just we had to change the amount of spitns for the prepeller yeah or else it wouldn't get across at all
9147,we have to use them a lot cause we change em and keep em the same and change em and,well we have to use them a lot cause we change them and keep them the same and change rahmin
9148,yeah mmm hmm,yeeah
9149,um we spun it eighty times and it got all the way across yeah,um we've spent it eighty times and it got all the way across yeah
9150,um well it if it well there you twist okay there's a couple ways that you can twist it if you twist it one way it'll go backwards and another way it'll go forwards,um well it if it well there you twist ok there's a couple ways that you can twist it if you twist it one way it'l go backwards in another way it'll go forwards
9151,it's probably gonna make it slow down a lot,it's probley gon to make it slow down a lot
9152,uh i love to write and do math,uh i love to rite and do math
9153,um yeah,yeeah
9154,if you like changed how many propellers or something that was on there it might go farther or faster,if you like changed how many prepellers or something that was on there it might go farther or faster
9155,um well those toothpicks it helps hold the propeller in so it'd stay on and won't fall off mmm hmm,um well those toothpicks it helps hold the prepeller in so it's stay on and won't fall off
9156,hmm i would have to say reading,i would have to stay reiting
9157,yeah we haven't cha we're gonna like put little paper clips on it,yeah we havn't cne were gone to like put little paper clips on it
9158,um we've been doing a lot of things like we're right now we're learning how like about airplanes and propellers and that sort of thing,um we've been doing a lot of things like were right now we're learning how like about airplans in prepellers and thats sort of thing
9159,yeah,yeah
9160,mmm hmm yeah,yeh
9161,mmm hmm yeah,yeah
9162,um we start at one side of the chair and we start spinning the propeller and then we hold it and we wait and then we let it go and it just goes straight across,um we start at one side of the chair and we start spitting the prepeller and then we hold it and we wait and then we let it go and it just go stright across
9163,probably making it fly cause it took us a really long time to make it go the certain amount,probably making it fly cause it took us a really long time to make it go theceri emain
9164,yeah,yeah
9165,i don't really understand how it'd fly i just does it like suck in the a i just don't know if it sucks in the air to make it or pushes out air to make it go,i don't really understand how it fly i just doesn't like suck in the  i just don't know if it's sucks in the air to make it or pushes out the air to make it go
9166,um make it go faster or maybe farther,um make it go faster or maybe farther
9167,yeah mmm hmm,eeah
9168,um uh well uh,well u
9169,uh it was between like thirty five and forty about,uh it was between like thirty five and forty about
9170,like y you'd like twist the propeller so it gets the push of it helps the plane glide or get pushed across,like you you'd like twist the prepeller so it gets the push of it helps the plaine glide or get pushed across
9171,um if you go left it would go backwards and right it'd go forward,um if you go left it would go backwards and rite it go forward
9172,uh it'd be sorta like the passengers on the plane,uh it be sorto like the passengers on the plane
9173,yeah,a
9174,i didn't know that the plane would fly that easily just straight across,i didn't know that the plaine would fly that easily just straight across
9175,yeah,yearh
9176,okay,us
9177,uh i'm the i have been the best reader in my grades for the past seven years yeah,uh i'm the i hve been the best reater and my grades for the past seven years yeah
9178,because the paper clips make it a lot heavier and usually it's just lights and it it'll just fly across but with the paper clips,because the paper clips make it a lot heavier and usually it's just light init it'll just fly across but with the paper clips
9179,they're like about that big and you hook em onto the plane and we're gonna see how many can get across without making it stop,there like about that big and you hook him on to the plane and were gon to see how many can get across without making it stop
9180,yeah,yeah
9181,yeah,yeah
9182,um well the straws just help it keep it on the strings so that it can fly,um  the straws just help it keep it on the strings so that it can fly
9183,yeah and the propeller is really the main thing cause it really gets the push it just make it go right across,eah and the prepeller is really the main thing cause it really gets the push s just make it go right across
9184,yeah,yeah
9185,yeah it w,yeeah
9186,yeah,yeeah
9187,oh the different centimeters on the stick,oh the different cendimetors on the stick
9188,uh yeah,uyeah
9189,yeah,yeah
9190,yeah,yere
9191,uh put it put lighter weights on it,uh put it put lighter whites on it
9192,mmm hmm yeah,yeah
9193,yeah if,yeah if
9194,we um we changed the variables by making the mass of the tin foil squares bigger like we'll go to thirty centimeter tin foil sheets and then so on,we um we change the veriables by making the masss of the tenfoil square s bigger like weill go to thirty cenimeter toe il sheets and then so on
9195,it would go a lot farther cause it has less weight and,it would go a lot farther bcause it hes less wigh an
9196,uh all the way in yeah is yeah,all the way in yeah is yeah
9197,yeah yeah,yes yeah
9198,it wouldn't you couldn't really compare anything cause your answers to it would be all different and yeah,it wouldn't you couldn't really compare anything cause toure answers to it would be all different and yeah
9199,it really depended on the place where you had put it cause really if you didn't have it it wouldn't go anywhere,it really depended on the place where you had put it cause really if ye didn't have it it wouldn't go anywhere
9200,yeah,ah
9201,cause uh then it tells you uh more about it and what you're gonna really do in the science project,cause uu then it tells you a more about it and what you're going to really do in the science projects
9202,yeah,yeah
9203,ball uh i forgot what it's called yeah or except we made ours square cause it'll stay on the stick better,ball uh i forgot what is called eeah ur except we made our square s itt'l stay on the stick bitter
9204,mmm yeah,nah
9205,it the object that you're flinging,it s the object that you're flaing
9206,yeah,yeahh
9207,be different,be different
9208,yeah,yeah
9209,yeah,yeah
9210,yeah,yeah
9211,but the lower the um farther out you put the stick the more um the less um,but below the um farther out you put the stick the more um the less um
9212,um ten centimeter and twenty centimeter aluminum foil,u tenn ent a meter and twenty sent ometeor elumino foil
9213,so far we have um seen h what the highest um fling was and with what object it was,so far we have um seen hwhat the hiest um fling was and with what object it was
9214,yeah,ya
9215,aluminum foil,alooma for
9216,it would be way off because they would go like across the room and other people would only go maybe like a quarter of the way across the room,it would be way off because they would go like cross the room and other people w only go may be like a qarter of the way across the rm
9217,it's gonna go not as far,it'gago not as far
9218,it would probably get m all messed up and wouldn't work just like it was supposed to and just t just stop working after they tried it,it would probably get all mast up and wouldn't work just like it was supposed to and just just stop working after they tried it
9219,uh maybe angle on it and see if we can cha uh,maybe angle on it and see if we can che uh
9220,it it's like a system all the parts work together in to make something else work together,it eit's like a sistom all the parts work together and to make something else work together
9221,uh we had uh what is it called it's like a little,uh we had uh what ist called t's like a little
9222,uh it'll probably make it go farther because it has a lot more angle n and it's more upright more than if you have it flat it'll just go up,uh it'll probably make it go farther because it has a lot more angle and more upbright more than if you have t flat it i'll just go up
9223,yeah,yeah
9224,height or length away it would get,heights or length away it would get
9225,no,y
9226,you have to think a lot because because the teacher might give you something they need to think about,you have to think alot cause cause the teacher might give you ssomething they need think about
9227,mixtures and solution,mixtures and selutio
9228,good,good
9229,the rock weighs more,the rock waves more
9230,we're doing and science solution to mixtures well he said forgives doesn't play,um we're doing in science s sellutions and mixtureswy he said fore against dos am bls
9231,good,good
9232,we are doing mixutures and solution,we are doing mixtures and the leas

9291,they are about solutions,theyre are both sallucions
9292,this is the d cell battery,is the d seill battery
9293,well when you don't hook it up right with the wires and the battery and the light bulbs,wel when you don't huk it up right with the wires and the battery and the lipe bulbs
9294,yes,yes
9295,yeah,ea
9296,well the energy comes from this side into the light bulb,well the energy comes from this side into the light bulb
9297,well we were supposed to use one but our group thought maybe two batteries for two light bulbs but that didn't really work so we took one d cell,well we were spposed to use one but our group that maybe to baderys for to lighe bulbs but that didn't really work so we took ondy set
9298,yeah,na
9299,yes sometimes,yes sometimes
9300,yeah,a
9301,probably right here,probably right here
9302,yeah kind of we were like uh maybe this isn't the right way to do it,yeah kind of we relicke u maybe thisthe right way to do it
9303,and then this connects to the switch,and then this conects to the switch
9304,yeah,ye
9305,the switch is working it's a closed circuit when the switch is working and when it's open it's an open circuit and open circuits don't work so when you lift it up it won't work cause it's an open circuit,the switch is working it's a close circet when thiswitch is working and when it's open it's an open circet in the oen circen sdilt work so when you lift it up it won't work cause it's an open circe
9306,and this hooks up to the light bulb chamber,he scs up to the light ball chamberr
9307,it's here and that,serin thtewhe hhe
9308,that's a switch and then these are where you connect the wires,that's a swish and then theave aure way to conect the wires
9309,i think so maybe,i think so maybe
9310,well,well
9311,okay,ac
9312,well,wll
9313,and we probably touched the switch to,rud probably attatch the swish to
9314,well,wl
9315,most of them yeah,most of hemmia
9316,here into the other,here into the other
9317,okay,te
9318,that having two batteries would be kind of harder since you have two light bulbs it would seem to be easier but because we have two more one more to h battery to handle it's a little bit harder,that having two poers would be ckind af harder since you have to lighe bubs o it seem to be easier but because we have two more one more to battery to handle it's a littlebit harder
9319,um it's not connected so there's no usually a circuit would go like this it's full,um it's not conected so there's no usully a circot but go like this it's full
9320,and it goes through,and it goes through t
9321,energy and then it goes out,energy and then it goes out
9322,this is the positive side and this is the negative side,this is the positive side and this is the neggutive side
9323,yeah my teacher did it's parallel circuits well we noticed that the light bulb when it lit up it was dull so parallel circuits i think make them light up more,yea my teacher did it's parlill surcuts well we noticed that the light bub wouldn't lit up it was dull so paralll circuts i think make them light up more
9324,when you connect it to the light bulb i it has to connect to metal to metal or it won't work,when you connect it to the light bolb it has to conect meddale to medal ur it wol't work
9325,that parallel can never touch,that parilell can never touch
9326,the switch makes them turn on and off so maybe if you go up or down you could always come back to off or on or,this wich makes them turn on and off so maybe if you go up or down you coulnd always come back to offer on the
9327,nah uh,ah
9328,so the light bulb can get all of it's,so the lift blub can get all of its
9329,because it was kind of too complicated to do it with two cause you had to figure out a special way when with one battery you could do a whole bunch of ways,because it was kind of yo complicated to do it with to bcause you had to figure ut a special way when with one battere could do c buncf lays
9330,the pa negative side of the battery and then this would have the positive side,the p th neggotive side of the batter and then this would have the positive sid
9331,yeah,e
9332,mmm hmm yay,a
9333,yeah,yeah
9334,yeah,da
9335,she could put another bulb in,she could put another bull ben
9336,the light bulb does not light up,the light bul does not light up
9337,yeah,yea
9338,only one uh a brother he's in college now though,only one h a brother he's in collage nowo
9339,a parallel circuit is when they never touch so if one bulb goes out it'll just be out and all the others will just keep going because well it's its own little circuit kind of,a parelill circut is when they never touch so if one bulb goes out it'll just be out and all the others will just keep going because well it's it's on little circet kind of
9340,an open circuit is when um is when maybe if you have a switch in a series circuit and you lift it up it becomes an open circuit and nothing happens,an open circut is when um is when maybe if you have a swish in a sery circet and you lift it up it becomes an open circut and nothing happens
9341,well it it stops the whole light from being lighted cause it makes an open circuit,well it it stops the whole lights from being lighted cause it makes an open circuet
9342,parallel,parelo
9343,i think it would go out,i think it would go ou
9344,mmm hmm yeah,yeah
9345,yes yeah,yes  calld   orget
9346,actually that one would probably well,actually that one would probably m
9347,okay,e
9348,um well it's just like any other light bulb uh the filament would break,um well it's just like any other like bub a the setiment will break
9349,hello no yeah,aano eah
9350,so it would come out here and then go through here and then come here and then come through here except there probably wouldn't be enough left after it went through over here,so it wuld come out here d i go through here and then come here and then come though here except they're probably wouldn't be enough left after it wenthrh overhere
9351,um they all stopped,um they all stopped
9352,those lights are bright e they're brighter than the series and i think it's because they don't take each other's electricity,those lights are bright tey'rebrighter than the ceries and i think it's because they don't take each other's electricity
9353,yep,ya
9354,sure,ca
9355,the bulb would just stay light,the bulb would just stay lit
9356,the no,the mo
9357,it had way too much electricity and then and then when you reached three it'll just blow up the light bulb,it had waze to much electrisity and then and then when he reached three it'll just blow de light blub
9358,and it never it never really actually attaches wires to the other light bulb,and it never in never really actually attaches wieres to the other like bo
9359,well it would create the electricity to go straight through,welm i'd create the lectrisity to go straight through
9360,well the lights at first they would go on then when a filament would break it would not be able to all open,well the lights at first they would go on when when a filment would break it would not be able to all open
9361,and then this one would take some of the electricity and then go like this,and then this one would take some of the electricity and thenot like this
9362,yeah our teacher told us to do that but we didn't really get the whole thing i yeah how do we wer the people that were making a parallel didn't know exactly how to do that,yah our teacher told us to do that but we didn't rally get the whole thing i yeah how we w the people that were making aparelell didn't know exactly how t do that
9363,afternoon,afternoon
9364,um well of course the light bulb is probably lighting up most likely of course and well,um well of course the like billb is probably liting up most likely of course and well
9365,yeah i think it would be like maybe one circuit and then the other circuit but,yeah i think it would be like maybe one circut and then the other sircet but
9366,yeah,yeah
9367,yeah,yeah
9368,and then go back into the light bulb to make it go out,and then go back into the lie polb to make you go ou
9369,cause they never touch,cause they never touche
9370,electricity,electicity
9371,because it's an open circuit and um it's not attaching t well it's not metal to metal in,because it's an open circet and um it's not attatching well it's not meddal to meddal ind
9372,um no that's a series,um n  aries
9373,circuit yep,er gsts  eaye
9374,yeah that one looks right,yah an' looks right io'
9375,yes mmm hmm,yes m
9376,okay,s
9377,i,it y to big i
9378,yeah,yeah
9379,um there's just not enough electricity to create uh enough for two,um there's just nonenough electricity to create uh enough for too
9380,well when you have a light bulb like this one i guess it would be li um the light bulb would,well when you have a lih bull like this mon i guess it would be l um the light bul would
9381,that's is s s the battery d cell,that's is the batter desal
9382,well okay so this would be the pa this would be the positive side and then so it would go through and then into the light bulb and then out back,well aka so this would be the po this would be the positive side and then so it would go through then into the light bolb and then out back
9383,yeah,do
9384,it's all stopping and staying,it's all stopping ind stayi
9385,yeah well it would probably be brighter or the same because it's it's own little circuit so it wouldn't really,yeah well it would probaby be brighter or the same because i's it's al little circut so it wouldn't really
9386,that'd probably be a parallel mine are that way too,tha'ld probly be a parlels mine arnt that way too
9387,yeah um almost ten,m almost ten
9388,these aren't working,these arn'tworking
9389,because when you press it down metal to metal it just goes straight through all the way to the light bulb,because when you press it dawn medal to medal its just gos straight through all the way to the light w
9390,i don't know,i don't know
9391,well we want to make a parallel circuit,well we want to make a parelel circuet
9392,yeah,nah
9393,except when we tried um putting two d cells together um positive side to positive or negative side just putting them together,except when we tried um putting to deseles together umpositive side to positive r neggtive side just putting them together
9394,that would probably i don't know well,that wore probably  well
9395,yeah,don
9396,yeah,a
9397,no but we thought about it and then we decided to and they probably are doing it right now,no but we thought about it and then we decided to and they probably are doing it right now
9398,complete the flow,compleat the flut
9399,well,wll
9400,yeah,ye
9401,yeah,mous
9402,yes,yes
9403,hello,little
9404,okay,
9405,well,wll
9406,yeah,yeah
9407,um yeah that looks about right,m i have hat looks about right
9408,the battery um creates the electricity to the flow,the battery um creats the electriscity to the flo
9409,yeah,yea
9410,yeah,ta
9411,he goes to front range in fort collins,he gas to front ragein for collems
9412,i would tell here that the lights did not burn out it's just one of them burned out and created an open circuit to make it as the electricity wouldn't flow through,i wuld tell her that the lights did not burn out it's just one of them burned out and created an open carcet to make it as the electricity wouldn't flow through
9413,um you would have a battery,um you'd have aboattery
9414,um it got brighter i think it even go brighter than the parallel circuit,um it got brighter i think it even got brighter than the parelels arcet
9415,april twenty fourth,april twenty fourth
9416,yeah,nia
9417,but i think i have an idea mmm well that's like a series but,but i think i have an ideathat's like a ceries but
9418,mmm yeah,yah
9419,well when you have,well when you have
9420,yeah he comes to town every weekend,yah he comes town everyweek and
9421,yes in the series circuit that i made we had very dull light bulbs so,yes in the ceries circut that i made we had very dull liht bulbs so
9422,normally on a series i think i don't know either,marelly on a ceries i think i don't nove there
9423,mmm hmm um the light bulb doesn't light up,mum the lypol doesn't lide up
9424,yeah,dow
9425,um the more wraps you you do around the rivet makes it so that it's stronger and maybe it keeps like a lot of energy going through it the more wraps,um the more raps you you d around the river makes it so that it's stronger and they be it keps like a lot of energy going through it the more raps
9426,i did um my prediction was that ten would pick up half of its number and that did not happen,i did my prtdiction was that ten would pick up half of its number and hat did not happen
9427,yeah we did,yeah ma a
9428,well whatever,not whatever
9429,um um it looked well here's the zero zero my axis um,um um it lick well here's the zero zero my accies um
9430,and sometimes uh there was both sides there was a wire and then on the end it was split into two so it would be like one battery over here and one battery over here,and sometimes on there was both sides there was a wire and then on the end it was split into two so it would be like one batterov here ind one batter
9431,yes,yes
9432,um no lines are the dots are where the line where it goes and so then that picked up three so it'd be,um  lins are the dots are where the lin where it goes and so then that picked up three so wod be
9433,and then we picked up twenty,and lanma picked up twenty
9434,um i don't oh what's um,i don't o wat's u
9435,he's talking about the food tomorrow for international day,he's talkingabout the food tomorrow for ant nastional day
9436,here yeah and then thirty picked up seven it should be four five and six about here,here yeah and then thirty picked up seven it should be four five six about here
9437,um yeah we're going to make a telegraph,um yeh we're goang to make at tel cat have
9438,i don't know why he keeps talking,i don't kow why he keps talking
9439,um no wait yes i thought that the more wraps you had the more washers you would pick up,um  w yes i thought that the more raps you had the more mashars yu would pick up
9440,oh well i don't think i think i did that wrong i think it goes like this and then this one,we i don't think i think i did that wrong i think it goes like this and then this  you'
9441,here,here
9442,yes,yes
9443,um the energy went straight to e from the wire to the um the rivet,um the energy went straight to from the wire to the um the ribber
9444,yeah,ya
9445,um you can't turn a magnet off but you can turn electromagnet off,um you can't turn a magnet off but you can turn elector magnet off
9446,well since we did ten wraps and it only picked up two it'd be like,well since we did ten raps and had only picked up to it be like
9447,um yes because it was wrapped around in a in a wire and it was kinda like a s a long stick,um yes because it was rapped around ind iin a wire and it was kind of like a sa long stick
9448,um that a magnet is actually made to pick them up and then when you have an electromagnet you have to do stuff to it to make it pick stuff up,um that a magnet is actually ma to pick the map and then when you haven't ellector magnet you ave the do stuff to it to make it pig stuff up
9449,um i think we're gonna use like everything that we've done already and to make it because um it cause all the time it just leads up to something bigger,um i think we can use like everything that we've done already and make it because um it ecause all the time it just leaves up to something bigger
9450,yeah,ey ask
9451,he made um a robot that um does magic tricks,he made u a robot that um does magic tricks
9452,and it would probably be not even,and it would probly be not even
9453,um i think it seemed weaker um when we used one battery but when we used two it made it bigger,um i think it seemed weeker um when we used one battery but when we used two it made a bigger
9454,yeah that surprised me from the gap between ten and forty five yeah and we did it thirty times and that only got us seven so that makes really weird sense,yeah that's serprise mfrom the gat between ten and forty five yeah and we did it thirty times inot only got a seven so that makes really werd sence
9455,no we didn't have a switch,no we didn't have a spetch
9456,of washers,rusars
9457,a line point graph a line point graph,a line point graf a line point graf
9458,um because i thought it would pick up at least half of it's number like five except it just picked up two so it's,um because i though i would pick up at least half of its number like five except it just picked up to so t
9459,the only thing that i can think of is like um uh uh uh at uh a junkyard where um they pick up like the cars and the metal things with the big magnet,i' ing hit ik an think if s like um at aat uhm a junk yard where um they pick up like the cars and the medtale things with he big magnet
9460,um we had it hooked up to a battery,um we had'hucked up to a battery
9461,um i don't know because we we only practice with washers but a magnet did pick those up so,um i don't know because we we' only practiced with wasers but a magnet dig picked those up so
9462,and then ten twenty thirty forty it actually did go up to fifty so,and then ten twenty thirty forty but actually did go up to fifty so
9463,um wraps,m rait siver
9464,mmm hmm yeah,mtha
9465,um we had a wire connected to the battery that was wrapped around the rivet um and then the other side went back onto the other side of the wire went back onto the wire battery,um he had a wire conected to the battery that was rapped around the river um and then the other side went back onto the other side of the wire went back onto the wlettery
9466,um we started making light bulbs light with a battery then we went into motors and then we made circuits and then we just started,um we started making li bulbs light with a battere then we went into motors and then we made sirceds and then we just started
9467,and of course this wrap increased kind of more than what we did because it was ten and ten and ten and then this one did fifteen,and of course this rap increased kind of more than what we did because it was ten and ten and ten and then this on did fifteen
9468,um it's when you have a wire and an iron like stick sort of thing,um it's when you have a wire and an irn like stick sort of thing
9469,we read about he stopped um,he read about he stopped um
9470,next wednesday,next wenesday
9471,the graph yeah it was kinda built in like this and then it had ten twenty thirty forty and,gra yeah it was kena builtin like this and then it i had ten wenty tirty forty and
9472,um he used his watch making skills and his magician skills,um he used his watch making skills and his magition skills
9473,stronger,stronger
9474,yeah we tried it with ten wraps and that us two washers,yeah we tried it with ten raps and that got us two washers
9475,um not exactly but when we hooked the the last wire up to the battery it would work,um not exactly but when we hook the the last wire up to the battery it would work
9476,yeah but it depends on the m magnet size of course and the rivet size,yeah but it depends on the magnet size of course and the verbict size
9477,that's really weird,that's really w
9478,wrap it with wires and connect it to batteries and,rabbit with wires and conect it to  batteris
9479,that'd be like the first line,thad be like the first line
9480,today we made an electromagnet yeah,today we made an electrcol magnet yeh
9481,um that the beginning it started off really small and then it got bigger and then huger,um that the begining it started a really small but it got bigger and the hugeer
9482,it looked like like,ind looked like like
9483,yeah,eh
9484,they both pick up iron things,they both pick up irn things
9485,um what surprised me was that ten wraps would pick up only two,um what surprize t me was that ten raps would pick up only two
9486,um yeah i think he used an electromagnet because that's what what we read before we did the electromagnet so it's probably what he used,um yeh i think he used onloked for magnet because that's what w we read before we did the ulec um magnet so it's probably what he used
9487,wraps,rab
9488,well becau we had a thousand ten but we also had this um cup that was a hundred so we used that too so i sorta you know,well because we had a thousand ten but we also had this um cup that was a hundred so we used that two s isorta no
9489,yeah because you know it's a hundred so you know it's gonna be right there but you'd have to do it ten times so yeah,youa're becauseyou kow it's a hundred so you know it's going to be right there but you'd have to do it ten times so ye
9490,n mmm not really,not hary
9491,uh one hundred milliliters fills up that,one hundred millaters fills up that
9492,well it's it's it's the same thing as the other one except they just flipped up,well it's it's it's the same thing as the other one except its just flippt up
9493,thanks,lengths
9494,mmm not really cause we all had different bottles every group so not really mmm hmm,not really cause we all had diferent bottles every group so not really m
9495,well because the if you use the same size everyone would have the same answer basically unless one's wider,el because if you used the same size everyone would have the same answer pacicaly unless one's wider
9496,mmm hmm yeah uh huh yep,yeah snip
9497,well this is one milliliter this is one hundred milliliters and this is like a thousand so you can like see the huge difference between them,well this is one leater this is one hunded mi ears and this is like a thousand so you can like see the huge difference between them
9498,um i'm not sure how many times but,um i'm not sure how many times but
9499,no not really it was it was um just like um seven up bottles not cans but bottles like the bo the big bottles yeah,n not really it was it was ony just like um seven up bottles not cans but bottles like the bot the big bottles yeh
9500,yeah it sorta was,he had swort of as
9501,the last one,the last one o
9502,two hundred,to
9503,yeah one milliliter,yeah one manlond
9504,yeah i guess,yeah maguss
9505,so so you're more,so so you're more
9506,huh well then probably have the same thing twice,hu full then probably have the same thing twice
9507,not all the way not all the way,not all the way not all the way
9508,mmm not really,not really
9509,really yeah,really yu yeah
9510,that's a f that's a um,that's a fetter um
9511,i think it just is trying to trick us but y you just did that one you already did that one,i think t yuis trying to trick us but yu justed that yu araty did tho
9512,the lines well um they they just tell you how much how full it would be it,the lions well um they they just tell you how much how fol it would be
9513,well because we wanted to keep track so we w so we wouldn't like get confused so yeah that's,well because we wanted to keep track so we w so we wuldn't like ghet confused so ye that's
9514,yeah cause i don't really think you could put the top in there anyways,yeeah bcause i don't really think it uld put the top in there r anyways
9515,yes no it doesn't look the same but it is the same because it's just that this is more taller and this is more wider but if you like if you like shrunk this into that it would be the same,yeah  no it doesn't look the same but it is the same because it's just that this is more toller and this is more witer but if you like if you like srumk this into that it would be the same
9516,yeah,ye
9517,mmm no i don't think so so it's just showing ten ten a hundreds would fit in a thousand,not think so so it's just showing ten ten hundreds would fit n a thousand
9518,yeah,yeah
9519,this well that's the fulcrum and it's the part where where you put the balance on like and it's where you get it like even,this  that's the pol groum and it's the part where where you put the ballence onlick and it's where you get it like even
9520,yeah,ede
9521,um well i'm,um well i'm
9522,yeah,yeah
9523,well,wll
9524,well well a gram it's,wll well a gram it's
9525,um we're we were um studying mass and um like and we're like using grams and that stuff um,um work we ere on te studying mass and like and were like using grans and atstuf um
9526,mmm no,no
9527,yeah yeah,yes ye
9528,we're working with that that and that,were woking with that that and that
9529,a big one equal yeah a big one equals a gram,a big one equayeah big when he clls a gram
9530,no well that's not one gram the well the little ones are five grams the littlest ones like that look like that are five grams and then the bigger ones are a little big bigger than that,no well that's not one gram the well the little ones are five grams the littlest ones like that look like that are five grams and then the bigger ones are a little big bigger than that
9531,no not yet,no not yet
9532,i probably use that instead of a whole bunch of those cause that's like way bigger than that so that one's probably a better like thing to put in the cups and you know,i probl yous that instead of a wholmunt of those bcause that's like way bigger than that so that ones probably a better like thing to put in the cups and you know
9533,mmm hmm and then i put in the bag and i waited until it got like um level and it,m and then i put in the bag and i waitedntill it got like on level then it
9534,yeah w f first i hold it in my hands and i weigh it and then i put it in it and then i guess,yet what ffirst i hold in my hand and i weay it an then i put it in it andi guess
9535,no not really,no not really
9536,and we're learning about like the base the fulcrum and the balance,and were learning about like the base the full crumb in the ballenc
9537,no we haven't,no we haven't
9538,yeah this is like exactly what we use,ye this is like exactly what we use
9539,yeah,yeh
9540,oh yeah and um it's just because if it's like way down here you wouldn't guess like one gram because how could that be possible,oh yeah and um it's just because if it's like way down here you wouldn't guess like one gram because how could that be possible
9541,well um we just do estimates like um uh educt educated guess and,well um we just do estimits like um  a agtegicated guess a
9542,well it just um let's the balance um s it makes it steady and not like wibble wobby,well it' just um that's the ballence um it makes it steady and not like wibble wopbly
9543,it seems like this is a thousand of those gram pieces and then this is probably if you stick em all together like really tight it'd probably equal that,it seems like this is a thousand of those gram pieces and then this is probably if you's stick him all together like really tight an'd probably equal that
9544,particle size and magnetism,particle size and magnatisom
9545,the important property is magnetism,the important property is magnatis
9546,i saw that the sand i think went stayed on the top of the filter when the water and salt went through,i saw that the sand i think w stayed on the top of the filtale when the water and the sult went throug

9549,the the paper clips are going to the magnet because they have magnetism,the mathe paperclips are going to the magnet because they have magnetiz
9550,i noticed that none of the other things would go with the magnet,i noticed that none of the other things would go with the magne
9551,because the stones are bigger than their particle size is bigger than the holes in the seam thing whatever you said,because the stones are biggere than the theyare partical size is biggled in the holes in the um sam thing whatever you said y
9552,we can separate mixtures by using magnets filters and evaporation,we can seporate mixtures by using magnets filtals and avapporati
9553,think we used um a different thing because there are paper clips which have magnetite in them so they would go with the magnet instead of just staying with others,ithink we used um a different thing because there are paperclips which have magneatighe in them so they would go with the magnet instead of yust staying with other
9554,don't go marni bye,don't go hard i b
9555,i didn't notice anything else but i but i think we use the filter because the stuff stayed on top,i didn't notice anything elsce but i but i think we used the filter because the stuffs tayed ont
9556,it is a solution,it is a sallution
9557,i noticed that the sieve stayed on top of the um the filter when the others things went down,i noticed that the seeds stayed on tp of thes um the fitl when the others things went do
9558,no,nol
9559,sure it two two things that keep their property,gur is to two fangs mixd together that keep their prope
9560,the rocks are staying on top because um because um their particle size is bigger than the hole,the rocks are staying on top because um because um they are particale size it's biggle ten the hol
9561,yes,yes
9562,we been talking about mixtures and solutions,we've been talking about mixtures and sellution
9563,different um we use different tools for different mixtures because each mixture has different things that have different properties,different um we use different trles for different mixtures because each mixture has different things that have different property
9564,property that's being shown is particle size,property that's being showne is particle s
9565,i noticed that the paper clips went with the magnet because they have magnetite in them,i notice that the paper clip swit with the magnet because they have magnetihteen
9566,okay,ok
9567,the one i picked was the salt because it's best for evaporating to make salt crystals,the one i picked was the sult because it's best full of vappirating to make salt christles
9568,that means well making the water not um go um well it's just making the water disappear to make the salt come,that means w making the water not um go um well it's just making thewater disappear to make the sult comb
9569,because they have different density stuff,because they have different ther cities tuff

9574,um it's about the limits about how much you can hold stuff,um it's about the limits about how much you can hold stuff
9575,i think that they're adding enough salt to make the water reach the limit about how much salt it can hold,i think that theyi're addings enough salt tan make the water reach the limit about how much salt it can hold
9576,um the water can hold four scoops of citric acid but only three scoops of epsom salt,m the water can hold fulr skips of si sitcerd aket assaid but only three ssgrups of ea some solt
9577,they're reaching their limits of how much they can hold in the water,they are reaching they on limint some how much they can hold in the water

9588,you can tell if it's more concentrated if um it's darker,you cantell is if it's m conent igted if um it's dark
9589,my prediction was right the one on the right weighed more than the one on the left,my prodiction was rat the one  the right wight more than the one on the left
9590,number two,number two
9591,number one is the most contrasted and then number two is the is the most diluted,number one is the most contrasted and the number two is is the most delut
9592,bad,bad've be learning
9593,um the the farther you go to the right the more contrasted you and the farther you go to the left the more diluted they,um the the farther you go to the right the more contrast i diou get and the firtthe e go to the left the more delod ig
9594,because the one on the right is more contrasted than the one on the left,because the one of the rights is more contrasted than the one on the left
9595,the grape thing the one to the left is more concentrated and the salt water water ones are,the great thing the one to the left is more conentrated and the sult water once such
9596,i think the one with the more grape powder will taste more like grape and the other one will taste more like water than grape,i think the one with a molle great pouder will tast mallike crape and the other one will tat more like water thin grape
9597,we been studying solutions,wee en studying sulutions

9609,the difference is the one on the right has less purple stuff the one on the left has less purple stuff,the difference is that one on the right has less purple stuff theone on the left has more puples stuf
9610,because you didn't add as much solute that you did to the solvent so they're less they're more diluted they are diluted,because you ddn't ad asmuch soll you that you did to the sulvent so they less they're more delud they are delute
9611,the taste is not as thick i guess,the tast is not a thick i guess
9612,taste,tast
9613,i noticed that the one on the right has more so the the it's darker and the left is has less so it's lighter,i noticed that the one on the right has ne role so the pop that it's darker and the left is has less so it's light
9614,um you can add more or less water,um you can ad more less water

9620,we learned about saturation,we learned about statuation
9621,you can say that it's more contrasted,you can say that it's more contrasted
9622,so solution a is more dense than solution b because the gram went to the bottom and then the b went to the top,so sallution is mortanc then sulution b because the gram went to the bottem and thebwnto the tal
9623,it just stays at the top,it just stays at the t
9624,it says that the blue is twelve grams when the green is two grams so it has ten more grams than it,it says that the blue is twelve grams when the gran as two grams so it has timor graos than
9625,because the the heavier one sunk to the bottom and mixed in with the lighter one,because the the heavier one sunk to the bottom and mixed in with he lital one
9626,one the less dense one goes stays to the top the one that i've already done that the one that's more dense will,one the lestis one goes stays to the top the one that i've arady don that the one that's more dence well
9627,they are being separated cause of their density,they are being sepporated bcause of their dencity
9628,i think this means that solution a is more dense than solution b,i think this means that sulution a is more dence than to sellution be
9629,their density came the their density became the same,the dencity cathetherdencity became the same
9630,they have more of the solute in them so they are more contrasted or more dense,they have more of the solu in them so they allmot contrasted mo dence
9631,well when you mix two solution salt solutions together one that the one that's more dense will sink to the bottom and the one that's less dense will go to the top float,but when you mix two salluin salt sallutions together one tha the one that's more dence wil sink to the bottom and the one that's me less denc will go to the top flat
9632,bad,ad
9633,in solution they would sink and in solution b they would float,in thi sallutin i  y would sink and insallutin be they would float

10080,no,no
10081,um because they would have like a static pole or attract,um because they would have like a stettic pol er attract
10082,the two metal rods are um reacting and making light,the two meddal rods are um re acting and making liht
10083,good bye,oodbye
10084,the two wires are going to connect to the battery and the light bulb is going to be in one of the slots on the base,the two wirs are going to conect to the battery and the late bullb is going to be ing one of the slides on the bace
10085,i didn't really fully hear the question because i pressed the space space bar,didn't really fully hear the question because they presse the spapspace bar
10086,the two cords are getting the static electricity into the light bulb,the two cards are getting the stettic electriscity into the lie bold
10087,yes,yes
10088,the circuits are connecting to the metal rods that are producing light,the circuts are conecting to the medal rods that are producing light
10089,the light bulb is lighting up,the lapol bens lighting up
10090,in the middle of the red covering there this there is a silver cor silver cord,in the middle of the red covering thereis there's a sivl csilver cord
10091,um you need two cords and a battery,um youd need two coards and a battery
10092,well the the cord connects to the light bulb and the battery is providing light,well the the cord connextsd to the lypebold and the battery is a porviding light
10093,sorry,uy
10094,a metal cord connecting to where they the light is providing,a medtal cord conecting to wher they the light is perfighting
10095,the the electricity is going up to the light bulb,the the lectriscity is going up to la bo
10096,the energy is going up to the into the light bulb by the cord or the wire,the energy is going up to the into the lapebol by the cord or the wa
10097,yes,yes
10098,because the two cords connect from the battery's energy into the light bulb that provides light,ecause the two course conectd from the batterye's energy into the libl that provie light
10099,the two cords are connecting to the battery and the battery th i mean the wires are connecting to the light bulb and making light,the two cors are connecting to the battery and the battery thet you mean the wairs are conecting to the lipe bulb and making light
10100,this circuit is going to connect to the wires,this circet is going to conect to the wires i think
10101,the two cords are connecting to the metal rods and making a electricity i mean electricity,the two cortsar connecting to the medtal brods and making a electriscity i mean electriscity
10102,um they are flowing from from each light bulb and giving more electricity and equal power to each light bulb,um they are floing fr from each labl and giving more lectrisity and equal power to each lapolb
10103,we have been making closed circuits open circuits and parallel circuits,we have ben making close circets zery circets open circets and purlo circuts
10104,the both of the circuits are flowing plus to minus but um from the left side it looks a little different,the both the circets are flying plusta min us but um from the left side it looks a little different
10105,they um what's special about the circuits are they make equal power and they are closed instead of open,they um what's special about the circutes are they make equall power and they are closed instead of open
10106,that the po the electricity is flowing through each light bulb um and making it equal light for each light bulb,that the pthe electriscity is flowing thrugh each lypol um and making it equal light for each lapol
10107,i think that um their the d cell is getting their giving the power to the two light bulbs,i think that um there the dsell is getting their giving the power to the two lyp bolbs
10108,um i could show with my finger of how i saw it um it was a series circuit and why the other one is a parallel,um i could che with my finger of how i thought um it was a seery circot and why the other one is a parellel
10109,good,good
10110,then the other light bulb would get brighter if it was a series no a parallel but if it was a series both of them would go out,then the otherligh blb would get brighter if its a sceries no a parelea but if it was a ceries both of them would go out
10111,well it also starts from coming out the negative and then it goes through the positive again and then comes out the negative on both ends it makes the circuit,well it also starts from coming out the neggive and then it goes through the positi begin and thent comes out the neggutive on both and it makes the circuet
10112,if if not a parallel circuit that means that there is only one circuit and it has to be an op closed circuit,if it's not a parell circut that means that there is only one circut and it has to be in o close circut
10113,that um if the op the circuit was open then the light wouldn't work,that um if the op the circet was opened then the light wouldn't work
10114,because if there's more of wires it will make the light stronger,because if there s more wires it will make the light stronger
10115,we have been trying to light two parallel circuits,we have been trying to lighte two parell circets
10116,it's a closed circuit and the the energy is going through the light bulbs and into the battery,it's a closecarcet and thethat ennergy is going through the lie bulbs in into the battery
10117,one circuit is going to the left and the other one is going to the right and the d cell is splitting up it's power,one circet is going to the left and the other one is going to the right and the daysell is splitting up its pouwer
10118,the battery's in the middle of the two light bulbs that are connected with wires,the battery is in the middle of the two lipe bus that are conected with wires
10119,um the flow helps the light bulb light and the flow helps the energy of the light bulb light uh um brighter,um the flow helps the lighebl light and the flow helps the energy of the ipple blite  um brighter
10120,the parallel circuits work with multiple wires connecting to the light bulb to make it brighter,the prll circets work with multipale wires conecting to the lypolpe to make it brigter
10121,parallel circuits are when there are two or more circuits connected to the battery and the light bulbs light and the motors work,pear tarcets are when thir two or more circets connected to the battery and the lap lips light or the motors work
10122,it's a parallel circuit because there's two or more wi wires to make a light bulb light,it's a parllll circut because there's two ore more wwires to make a liel blaint
10123,the circuit is go is making a closed circuit because there are aren't any holes,the circut is ismaking a close circet because there aaren't any holes
10124,the two wires are connecting to the light bulb and the other two wires are connecting to the other wire light bulb and it is providing power,the two wires were connecting to the lypebulb and the other two wires are connecting to the other whie lybulb and it is providing power
10125,it's a parallel circuit and both light bulbs are lighting from four wires,it's a parelo circet and both slyples are lighting from for wires
10126,it flows through the light bulbs and um it it comes from the d cell that goes into the light bulbs,it flowsa through the light bulbs and um it it comes from the deso that goes into the la bulbs
10127,good,good
10128,um it parallel circuits are important because it will give you more light and um it'll s give you more electricity,um it parrelll circuts are important because it will give you more light and um itls give you more electriscity
10129,i think it's a parallel circuit because there are two or more paths,i think it's a parellell circut because there are two or more paths
10130,okay,ok
10131,bye,i
10132,because it lights up more than two light bulbs and it provides more light,because it lights up more than two lie blbs than it provides more likht
10133,that the energy goes through the light bulb and goes and makes light,that the energy goes through the lypbulb and goes and makes light
10134,the magnets are put together and you are putting the wafer into the cup,the magnets are put together and yo'eputting the waver into the cup
10135,they make the magnets um hold less because the magnet field can't can't hold that much,they make the magnets um hold bless because the magnet field can't can't hold that much
10136,the spacers hold the magnets and they make them repel,the spacers hold the magnets and they make him repell
10137,can use spacers and anything that's iron or steel,you can use spicers and anything that's irn or steel
10138,the um when there's more wafers it can't hold that much and it's harder to hold the um wafers,um when there's more way fors it can't hold that much and it's harder to hold the um wafers
10139,we stacked the spacers on top of um uh magnet and see how many it would t take,swe stacke the spacers on top of um u magnet and see how many it would take
10140,well when the two magnets are together they are attracting and that holds more weight,well when the two magnets ir together they are attracting and that holds more wat
10141,probably four or five,probably four or five
10142,um the when there is less wafers no less spacers it's easier to hold the wafers,the when there is lest way for is not less sbacers it's easer to hold the way fers
10143,when they add the two other,when they ad the two other
10144,the spacer is um kind of repelling the two magnets and sort of um keeping them together,the spacer is um kind of repelling the to magnets and sort of um keeping them together
10145,a spacer is plastic and not iron or steel,a spacer is plastic and not i understal
10146,um it would probably be six or seven,um it would probly be six or seven
10147,yes,yes
10148,yes,yes
10149,repel means that they won't stick together no matter what,pril means that they won't stick togother no matter what
10150,we just did a line point gra graph,we just did a lane point cla gra
10151,yes,yes
10152,okay,ok
10153,no,no
10154,yeah,yeah
10155,they're holding the the wafers and the two magnets are holding it together,the're holding the the wayfeirs and the two magnets were holding it together
10156,a magnet will attract to iron and steel and if you f flip one of the magnets over they'll repel,a magnet will attract to irn and stal and if you clip one of the magnets over the'll repell
10157,yes,yes
10158,it would stick to the magnets and it would be ha it'd be easier to put the wafers in,it would stick to the magnets and it would be hard itwould be easier to put the wayfers in
10159,yes,s
10160,in one of the spacers we had ten,in one of the spacers we had ten
10161,the magnets become weaker and it can't hold much,the madnics become weeker and it can't hold muchh
10162,good,good
10163,we also had nineteen,we also had nineteen
10164,i'm pretty sure,pretty sure
10165,yes,yes
10166,we have been doing magnets,e have been doing magnets
10167,the metal the magnet only sticks on to the metal and steel because it has a magnet pole and the sponge doesn't have metal or steel in it,the meddal the magnet only sticks on to the meddal and stial because it has a magnet pole and the spunge doesn't have meddal or steel in it
10168,we did work with round magnets today,we did work with ron magnets today
10169,attract has a magnet pole that makes them closer and stuck together,attract has a magnet pul that make them closer and stuck together
10170,yes,yes
10171,steel sticks on to the magnet and the aluminium didn't stick on when the magnet hovered over the aluminum,steel sticks onto the magnet and the liminum didn't stick on when the magnet hovered over the louminum
10172,um one of the sides has a um a piece that won't stick and the other side has a magnetic pole,um one of the sides has a um a piece that won't stick and the other side has a magnetic poll
10173,no,no
10174,because some of some parts of the metal doesn't attract because um when they're opposites they don't really stick together,because some of some parts of the medtal doesn't attract because um when thei'r opposites they don't really stick together
10175,attract has um a pole and repel has a part of the metal that won't stick together,attract has um a puoll and repell has a part of the medal that won't stick together
10176,because they are um being attracted by the magnetic pole,because they are um being attracted by the magnit pole
10177,and i don't remember the other one,and i don't remember the other one
10178,good,good
10179,they attract they stick together and when they repel they don't want to get by,the attracked they stick together and when they repell they don't want to get close
10180,the aluminum doesn't stick on to the metal because um aluminium is a part of steel but it doesn't have a magnet pole in it,the alminum doesn't stick onto the middle because um aluminium is the part of steel but it doesn't have a magnet poll init
10181,if you put them if you both flip them over then they both will stu stick together bu if you turn one over they won't stick,if you put them if you both slip them over then they both will stuck stick together but if you turn one over they won't sick
10182,stick together when you put them together but when you flip one over they don't stick together,stick together when you put them together but when you flip went over they don't stick together
10183,bars are attracting or repelling,bars are attracting or repelling
10184,when they put the magnet closer then most of the metal and steel will stick on to the magnet,when they put the magnet closer than most of the medtal and stel will stick onto the magnet
10185,good,id
10186,um we made a light bulb light up with two wires and a battery,um we made a lighel lighte up with two wires in a battery
10187,they both have similar blood cells i mean cells not blood cells cells,they both have similer bloodselves i mean selves notblood selessellves
10188,it's how stuff is it's kind of,it's ho stuff is t'it's kind
10189,they're all kind of together they never flow apart from each other uh they're kind of like a pair,they're all kind of together they never flow apart from each other uat kind of like a pair
10190,the stomach takes the food into well the stomach kind of breaks it down into littler pieces and takes it to the uhm small intestines,thes stummic takes the food into well the stumic kind of breaks it down into little watter pieces and takes it to the um small intestins
10191,well we've been studying what's in your body,well we've been studing what's in your body
10192,well we talked about how the human body plays a role uhm well how what's in the human body and what certain things play certain certain roles,well we talked about how the human body plays a roll um well how we it's in the human boby and what certan things play certen certain rolles
10193,no idea,no idea

10205,i see blue cells and i see blue kind of short squiggly lines,i see blue shells then i see blue kind of short squiggly lines
10206,we've been talking the human body and,we've been talking out the human body and
10207,i see some big parts with these blue lines and uh they kind of run throughout the body and they connect to each other,i see some big parts with these blue lines and the they kind of run throghout the body and they condect to each other
10208,they both have stomach's mouths esophaguses and they both kind of depends on where they live they can live for a long time,they both have stumics mouths to the soppagases and they both kind ofdepends on where they live they can live for a long time
10209,the esophagus plays a big a role in the digestive system to make sure that all the food gets down to the uhm stomach,the  sopfic is playesd a big roll in the digusti sistom to make sure that all the food gets down to the um stumic
10210,well i know that it gets transfered to the stomach and goes into the small intestine which takes out the nutrients and then goes to the large intestines which takes out the moisture in it,well i know that it gets transfere to mto the stumic and goes into the small intestant which takes out the new drains and then goes to the large testencs which takes out the moisture a ne

10281,hello,helo
10282,we've been studying electricity and using circuits and then today we learned about series circuits,we've been s al trisy and using circuets and then today we learned about cery circuts
10283,it always f comes out of negative and goes into positive and so it travels through and so yeah,it always comes out of negutive and goes into pousitive and so it travels through and so yeah
10284,the battery always has to g flow back into the positive not negative,the battery os has to flowt back into the positive neggutive
10285,hello,hello
10286,it's time for me to go,t's time for me to go
10287,it always has to flow into the positive not the negatives and it always comes out the negative so yeah,always has to flot into the positve not thet neggutives and it always comes out of the negutiveso yeh
10288,the bulbs are both lighting up but in our class th we couldn't get em to,the bulbs are both laing up but in our class that we couldn't get thim too
10289,it flows through out of it flows away from the out of the negative end because it's just flowing out of the negative and then wants to turn into positive so that flows through,ps out of it flows away from the out of the negotive end because it's just flown out of the neggotive theme was to turn into positive so thatit flows through
10290,um it um it makes it it goes around so and so it comes around and then it keeps going in a circle and it powers the light bulb,um it um it makes it it goes around so and so it comes around and then it keeps going in a circle and it poer to ligh ball
10291,it always flows away from the negative end because it wants to turn into positive not negative so it'll always turns into goes away from the negative end,always flows away from the neggtive end because it ans o turne into positive not neggutive so itl always turns into gos away from the negutive end
10292,um one of em has really bright because it's um only goes through one light bulb but the other ones are not as bright because it has to go through two circuits so they're not as bright,um one of them has really bright because it's um only goes through one lapol but the other ones are not as bight because it hase to go thrugh to circets s the're not as bright
10293,it gives the light bulbs more power to run to the light make light um brighter and it's more powerful so,it gives the light bub s more power to run to light make light um brighter and it's more powurful so
10294,because in our classroom we did this exact same thing and um that happened,because in our class room we did this exact same thing and um that happened
10295,well they are officially sticking together so they are trying to attract attract to each other but the poles keep them apart even though they're still touch trying to touch each other,well they are affishially sticking together so they are trying to at trick a track to each other but the poll is keeping them uppart even though they are still touch trying to touch each other

10298,it's been nice talking to you bye,spen nices talking to you by
10299,good bye,goodbye
10300,yes,yes
10301,it's where when you put like a magnet to a nail it sticks and maybe you can put a paperclip on and it'll stick too but then when you take it off it might drop or sometimes it still stays on for a little bit,it's ware when you put like a magnet to a nail it's sticks and  mabye you can put a paper cit on and it'll stick too but then when you take it off it it might drop or sometimes it still t stays onit for a little bit
10302,it does not work with magnets,it does not work with magnets
10303,um the nail is connecting to some other metal so it makes the metal generate powers to make the motor run just like the on switch would,um the nail is connecting to some other mettal so it makes the medtal gennerate powurs to make the moter rone just like the ans wich would
10304,what do you mean,what do you mean
10305,brass hole i mean washer and nothing else,brass hole i mean water and nothing else
10306,well the insulators don't power anything and so the motor won't run and get powered by um anything and so you won't have a working motor,bl the and there is don't power anything and so the motor won't run and get powered by um anything and so you won't have a working motor
10307,bye,bit
10308,good,good
10309,they don't let metal f flow through them they're just kinda solid for for with electricity,they don't let metals flow through them the're just kind of solid ffur with electrisity
10310,we've been experimenting with circuits with batteries wires and motors or lights and uh switch,we've been experiencing with circuets with batteryes wirs and motors are lights and us wich
10311,i don't know,i don't know
10312,no not exactly it just keeps it people safe from e electrocuting themselves or getting shocked or getting um hurt,no not exactly it just keep it people safe from the electicuting themselves ire geting shocked or getting um hurt
10313,yes,yes
10314,i actually just remembered that i aluminum does stick because it is metal just a different kind,i actually just remember that a elleamhant of those stick because it is medtal just a different kind
10315,i put the straw in the wrong place because i just thought it was a strip of metal,i put this strana rong place because i just thought it was a strip of mettal
10316,um all metal is c a conductor is what i learned today so it powers the generators like the on switch would because it's metal,um all meal is o conductor is what i learn todayso it powuers thet gennorators like the ans which would because it's medal
10317,what,what
10318,hello,hello
10319,it when the the more wraps around the rod um you make the more washers it can pick up,it when the the more raps around the rod um you make the more waters it can pick up
10320,well if the switch is open it won't let the flow of electricity go all the way through,wrl if the swish ist opend it'swon't with the flow of electrissity go all the way through
10321,well if you open the s if you open the switch it blocks the electricity and if it's closed it lets the electricity flow,well if you open the sif youll open the swish it lack the electristy and if it's closed it lecs the electrisity fall
10322,well there's a wire a switch a base,a washers a desell and a roa middle rob
10323,n mmm,m
10324,we fill it up we fill the sponge up with water let it drip all the extra water out and then put the wet sponge in the other c in the cup,we fill it  we fill the spunge up with water let drip all the extra water out then put the wet spunge in the other c in the cup
10325,mmm i can't really remember,cait really remember
10326,an empty water bottle or something,an empty water buttle or something
10327,if you put like five in at once maybe it's too heavy unless it's like a heavy item like say hmm,if you put like five and at once maybe it's too heavyunless it's like it heavy i dum like say m
10328,the kilogram is one thousand grams,a kilgram is one thousand grams
10329,three grams,threegrams
10330,it went well but some of our sponges were different um sizes because they were cut out from a bigger sponge so we didn't all get the same answer,ewet well but some of our spunges were different um sizes because the re cut upt from a bigger spunge so we didn't all get the same answer
10331,well hmm,well m
10332,what's up with the soda can,wit's up wit the soat again
10333,no maybe one more,no madi woll more
10334,more definitely more because it has water in it,more defnately more because it has water in it
10335,maybe laptop computer a bag,maybe ap top computer a bag
10336,um it's a balance,uhm it's a ballence
10337,that's about as good as we can get,that's about as good aspeaking yet
10338,maybe one or two,maybe one or two
10339,until and then when it gets level that's when you know when to stop then you count how many grams were in the other cup and that's how many grams it weighs,until and then when it gets level that's when you know in to stop then you cont how many grams were ing the other cup and that's how many gramsways
10340,well over,ollover
10341,um it the f the five grams turned into a five block,um it the the five grams turned into a five block
10342,six grams,six greamus
10343,well we took um we were measuring how much water a sponge could hold,well we took uhm we weren' measuring how much water us spunge could hold
10344,um the water in the sponge,um the water in the spunch
10345,um we we get a r dry sponge and then we put it in one of the plastic cups and then we measure it by grams,um we we get a dry spunge and then we put it in one of the plastic cups and then we measure it by grams
10346,okay,k
10347,something like that,something like that
10348,the wet the wet sponge dr um weighs more cause there's more stuff added to it like liquid so it's a lot heavier,the wet the wet spun  um waves more cause er's more stuff added to it like liquid so it's a lot heavier
10349,measuring with grams how can i put that well y they're grams are like this big and um you put them in the other cup one by one so,masering with grams how can i put that well you t grams are like this big and um you put them in the other cup one by one so
10350,that's good,that's good
10351,oh today,oh today
10352,i thought it would be like ten nine something like that,i thought it would be like ten nine something like that
10353,no not really,' not really
10354,well,well
10355,um the water is filling up the pockets,uhm the water is filling up the pockets
10356,testing testing,tusting testing
10357,they're not as heavy but if you put like a kilogram which is like one thousand grams then you could measure by kila um measure weight with kilograms maybe,they're not as heavy but if you put like a killegram which is like one thousand grams and you couldt measure by killing um measure waight with killegrams maybe
10358,becau if it was something really heavy you would use a kilogram,because if it was something really heavy yit would use to kill gram
10359,mmm hmm nope put another gram that's good,no put anothe dram that's good
10360,oh yeah sixteen um wait that's ounces sixteen ounces is a pound,oh yeah sixteen um wight that tounis sixtenouncis eight pound
10361,level means that um this little bar is lined up with this thingie,level neads that um this little bar is lined up with this t
10362,wow,well
10363,so say when i put the dry sponge in it's like this and another gram then another gram then another gram and now it's pretty balanced right,so say when i put the dry spung in it's like this an another gram then another ga with another gram and now it's pretty buncs right
10364,it's extra water,it's extra water
10365,it can get messy,it can get messy it's
10366,twenty grams i think twenty one grams of water wait twenty four grams of water,twenty gramd i think twenty one gramsof waterwih twenty four grams o water
10367,ab an estimate is just guessing,a an estimat is just guessing
10368,with a balance,with balence
10369,texas from here maybe something like that,texas from here may te's something like that
10370,um the dry sponge when we measured it it measured about one or two grams can't really remember,um the dry spunge when we measured it it measured about one or two grams can't e really remember
10371,the bigger s the big sponge would hold more water and it would weigh more when it's dry,the biggest the big spindes would home wrm waterand it would wah more when it's dry
10372,mmm hmm probably,probably
10373,twenty we got,twenty we got
10374,well well you do you have a picture of it,wl well you dyou hat a picture of it
10375,if i had anything at my disposal i would use a,if i had anything at my disposali would use a
10376,well the soaked one would definitely be the most the dry one would definitely be the lightest and then and then the wet one would be just in the middle,well the soalke one would definately be the most e draone would definately be the lightest and then and then the wet one would be just in the middle f
10377,no not really you just look at it and guess,not reall just look at it and guess
10378,well if we well we're we're we're um measuring weight in class so,well if wewell were we were um measuring waht in class so
10379,then take something lighter than an orange,then take something lighter than hair orange
10380,not very heavy,not very heavy
10381,so if it's dry it's not gonna be very big wet it's gonna be a little bigger and soaked it's gonna be gigantic,so if it's dry i's not going to be very big whet it's going to be a little bigerin saked it' can'tbe jigantic
10382,no,h
10383,probably when you're doing like maybe a yogo or something uh,probably when you're doing like maybe a you'll go or something that' u
10384,yeah but if it's if it's too if it's like an heavy item you can go by fives or something like that,yeah but if it's if it's too if it's like an heavy idum youcan go by fives or something like that
10385,mmm probably not,probly not
10386,you you take out the grams one by one and count them it tells you how much to subtract from the wet sponge,you you take out the grams one by one and cat tanit tells you how much to subtract from the wet spunge
10387,i have no idea really i have no idea,i have ano idea real he had an idea
10388,and so we take the dry sponge and we put it in first and then we measured that out so we know how much to subtract from from the s s and then we,and so we take the dryes spungin we put it in first and then we measured that out so we know how much to subtract from from this s and then we
10389,not really,noaly
10390,maybe a little heavy,maybe little heavy
10391,maybe yeah it may be more than one kilogram,maybe yeah i maybe more than one kill game
10392,no it was well it was cut out from a bigger sponge so so we a all our tables got different answers,m it was well it was cut out from a bigger spunge so so we  all our tables got different answers
10393,no not much,no not much
10394,yeah because then if you put in like a twenty it can go like thunk or something like that,yeah because then if you put itn like a twenty it can go like thum cor something like dat
10395,no,no
10396,and then you put them put the grams in one by one again,and then you put them put the grams in one by one again
10397,yeah,yeah
10398,milligra i think there's these things called milligrams i can't remember but they're something bigger than a kilogram oh yeah,millegra i think there's these things called milligrams i can't remember but there's something bigger than a killigramo yah
10399,one hundred,one hundred
10400,well you're looking for until it's perfectly leveled,will you're looking for until it's perfectly level
10401,i don't know,
10402,well,wll
10403,and measuring anything no measuring how heavy it is,and measuring anythingno measuring how heavy it is
10404,yeah,idea
10405,well when you have the wet sponge you weigh it until it's full and you know h that it's full when it when it stops getting bigger,well when you have te wet spun you wait until it's full and you know h that it's full when it when it stops getting bigger
10406,dry sponge,dry spunge m
10407,well if,well
10408,hundred thousand wow,hundred thousand awel
10409,and not kilograms kilograms are like one hun one on hundred grams or something i can't remember one thousand,and not killgrams  killigrams are like one hunt one one hundred grams or something i can't remember teone thousand
10410,grams well there's different sizes of grams there are one grams which are bi about this big five grams which are about this big and then ten grams which are about this big this big,grams bullder's different sizes of grams thereare one grams which are abig about this big five gramps which are about this pig and then ten grams which are about this pig this ig
10411,when we use meter is like,when wuse meator is like
10412,i don't know really i don't know,i don't know really  no
10413,well if you have this really heavy object you don't wanna go one one one one one one one,well if you have this really heavy object you don't want to go one one one one one one one
10414,hi,hig
10415,probably,probaably
10416,yeah,yeah
10417,in the balance and then you measure it out with the grams,and the balence and then you measured out with the grams
10418,yeah,yeah
10419,um uh how much water is in that a dry sponge can hold,um how much water is in that a drye spunge can hold
10420,well we're trying to figure out how how much how much water a sponge can hold in grams so,well we're trying to figure out how how much how much water a spunge can hold in grams so
10421,there's like a billion centa centigrams in a kilogram so uh,there's like a billy  cenigcenigrams in a killigram so
10422,and then you take a five and then another five and if it's too heavy when you put in the n another five you would take the five out and put in four little gram pieces,and then you take a five and then another five and if it's too heavy when you put innother five youd take the five out and put in four little grand pieces
10423,um the,um the
10424,yeah,yeah
10425,so when you're measuring it out with the grams then when it's perfectly leveled you subtract um one or two of the grams from the sponge so then you know that's how much water,so when youre measuring it out with the grams then when it's perfectly leveled you subtracts um one or two of the grams from the spunge so then you know that's how much water
10426,because it may be too much,because it maybe too much
10427,he light very light,light very lighter
10428,because maybe they they were cut unevenly,because maybe they they were cut un evenly
10429,centimeters,senimeteors
10430,sponges sponges they soak up water they help you clean stuff,spunghes spunghes they toke up water they help you clean stuff
10431,like a kilometer is one thousand meters,like a colameter is one thousand meteors
10432,and the and the dry sponge was about this big it wasn't very big,and the and the drye spungch was about the s pig it wasn't very big
10433,centimeters these are about a centimeter long which is amazing yeah,sid mtors these are about a centimr long which is aming yatat on
10434,then,d
10435,yeah,yeah
10436,maybe the length from,maybe the length from
10437,grams are measuring tools,grams are mesuring tools
10438,yeah,yeah
10439,that you can mes that you can make it that you can make them the same by putting maybe something lighter but you can use more than one of those lighter things,that you can measr that you can make it that you can make them the same by puting maybe something lighter but you can use more than one of that ost lighter things
10440,like computers doors books,lake computters dooors books
10441,not that i remember,not that i remember
10442,no not really,no r really
10443,well it's a measuring thing it measure it measures what is heavier than the other,well it's a measuring thing it measure it measures what is heavier than the other
10444,no not really not so much,no really not much
10445,wider than table than tables are high,whiter than table than tables are high
10446,well one of them is straight up and one of them is kinda wobbly so you don't measure it the correct way,well one of them is straight up and one of them is kind of wobliy so you don't measur it the coricet way
10447,so if you're talking about centimeters and decimeters decimeters is ten centimeters,so if you're talking about snmeters in desimuters eimuters is ten cenimuters
10448,um when the paper clips got put in to measure the same as the chip we didn't but it was the most interesting here,um when the paper clip got put in to measure the same as the chipwe didn't but was the most interesting heare
10449,well um doors are um can be,well um dors are um can be
10450,measurement,measurements
10451,um like with meters and centimeters and inches and feet and stuff like that,um like with meeters and cintmeters and inches and feet and stuff like that
10452,yes,yes
10453,millimeters can't really remember what those are but,no meanerscan really remember what those are but
10454,um rulers,rulers
10455,um we just um measured things with meter tapes and stuff like that,um we just um measured things with meter tipes and stuff like that
10456,no not really yeah you put em you put that one on top of that one and then you put things in these and then you ba try to balance them out,no not really yeah you put him you put that one on top of that one and then you put things in these and then you got to try to ballence them out
10457,yeah,yeah
10458,there's ten um millimeters in a centimeter,there's ten um millo meaters in he cetam meater
10459,nope,nope
10460,i don't really know,i don't't ly know s
10461,well it was a long time ago but i think i can remember how many big steps it took,it was long time ago but i think i can remember how my big steps it took
10462,no not everybody,no not everybody
10463,okay and we always use and we also use body benchmarks so if we like don't have a ruler um i can tell like what's an inch what's a foot and what like that stuff like that,o  and we always use and we also use boddy bench marks so if we like don't have ruler um i can tell like what's an inch what's a fit and what like that stuff like that
10464,no,note
10465,but i get it like twenty is two tens two tens equals four fives four fives equals forty wu um equals twenty ones,but i get it like twenty is two tens two tens equals for fives for five equales forty um equals twenty ones
10466,no,no
10467,meters so there's one hundred centimeters in a meter right,meters so there's one hundred cino meters in a meter right
10468,i could,ikao
10469,nah uh,uuh
10470,this looks like a meter tape yeah,this looks like a meter tape yeah
10471,yeah oh yeah i see,yeah oh yeah i see
10472,oh yeah,oh yeah
10473,um well,um well
10474,um well then we had the i can't remember what it was called,um well then we had the i can't remember what it was called
10475,this um our container didn't have like one hundred nine hundred stuff like that,this um ur container didn't have like one hundred nine hundred to flig that
10476,yeah,yeah
10477,yeah,yeah
10478,i think we're finished,i think we' finish
10479,yeah it's it said like five ten fifteen twenty up to fifty pretty w,yeah it's it said like five temn fiften twenty up to fifty pretty
10480,we would um calculate it on a sticky note we'd do like fifty one hundred one hundred fifty two hundred stuff like that,we would um caouculated on a sticky note odyo like fifty one hundred one hundred sicty two hundred jstiff like that
10481,no we we had twenty five in our graduated cylinder and then two hundred in the container,no we had twenty five and our gratuated silunder and then two hundred in the container
10482,well um the graduated cylinder um counts like one two three four five six um milliliters the container just holds the water,well um the gratuated silunder um counts like one i yuvizics um mill leaters the container just holds the water
10483,uh huh yeah,uu yeah
10484,um it wasn't the most efficient way but still it was the best you could get with school stuff,um it wasn't the most effichient way but still it was the best you culd get with school stuff
10485,oh yeah,arya
10486,um using something more scientific like um,um using something more sceientific like um
10487,then my dad flew me home he ha he used to have a job in california,then my dad f me home he h he used to have a job in callifornia
10488,no we had,no we had
10489,well yeah what you said was what happened i just can't repeat it all,well yeah what you said was what happened i just can't repeat it all
10490,well i can't really tell the difference,well i can't really tell the differentce
10491,gram weights in the other cup by the sponge and it was equal,gram waits in the other cup by the spunge and it was equal
10492,it's absorbed as much as it can and so that's coming out of it because it looks like it was just pulled out of the water and put in the cup and so the water's pooling around it because that water came with it,it's absorbs as much as it can and so that's coming out of it because it looks like it was just pulld out of the water and put in the cup and so the water is pulling around it because that water came with it
10493,the sponge has absorbed water and so it's tipping the balance scale,this spunch has absorbed water and so it's tipping the ballence scal
10494,it isn't very big because it doesn't have water in it because water fills it up and makes it bigger,it isn't very big because it doesn't have water in it because water fills it up and makes it bigger
10495,if it's sort of hardish then you know it's isn't wet because water makes it move around more easily,if it's sort of hardish than you know it isn't wet because water makes it move around more easily
10496,good,good
10497,we have been studying how much sponges can absorb,we have been studying how much spunges can obsorb
10498,we were measuring how much it weighed with water and without water and how much water it could get,we were measuring how much it wahed with water and without water and how much water it could get
10499,this is a picture of measurement of the sponge and he of the dry sponge and here it weighs three grams,this is a picture of measurment of the spunge and he of the dry spunge and here it wees three grams
10500,it's wet so it moves it's wet so it moves more easily and it's absorbed some water,it's wet so it move it's wet so it moves more easilly and it's absorbs some water
10501,the sponge is weighing more and more because it's absorbing water,the spunge is weing more and more because it's absorbing water
10502,the le the left one is dry the middle one is wet and the right one is soaked,the let the left one is dry the middle one is wet and the right one is silked
10503,tell how much the wa water weighs and how much a sponge can absorb,we can
10504,you can find out how much the sponge weighs how much it can absorb and how much,the water eys
10505,the water drips out and it gets an it gets a little bit smaller,the water drips out and it gets and it gets a little bit smaller
10506,it's sort of crackles,it's sort of crackles
10507,sponge has gotten bigger and more flexible and less hard,spunge has gotten bigger and more flexible and less hard
10508,the sponge is weighing more and more beca,the spunge is weying more and more becaus
10509,temperature is how hot or how cold things are and you can use thermometers to tell,temperature is how hot or how cold things are and you can use termometers to tell
10510,i see fifteen degrees difference,i see fifteen degrees difference
10511,i see the temperature going down a lot a lot a lot and then slowly going upward,i see the temperature going down i lot a lot af lot and then slowly going upward
10512,can write it down of course or,can wride it down of course or
10513,we noticed sort a same the same degrees and it sort of rose after a few minutes slowly,we notice sort of asat the same degreese an it sort of rose after a few minutes slowly
10514,it's going down because the ice cube is frozen water so it's cold,it's going down because the ice cub is frozen water so it's cool
10515,the robot is testing cup b with his finger,the robot is tosting cup bee with his finger
10516,the ice cubes will melt and the water will get warmer,the ice kumpes will melt and the water will get warmer
10517,measured the exact degrees and how different all the class's measurements were,measured the exact degrees and how different all the classes measure ments were
10518,water,water
10519,we were checking the changes in temperature every minute,we were checking the changes in temperature every minute
10520,it means that some have higher degrees than others and this robot is trying to tell,it means that some have hiere degrees then others and this worl abot is trying to tell
10521,you could show something the same temperature or you could write it down,e
10522,we have measured temperature,we have measured temperature
10523,holding what,uld it we
10524,the temperature's changing,the temperature is changing
10525,which one is coldest warmest and in the middle,which one is the coldest warmest and in the middle
10526,water air us and,and liquids and some solid and most gasses
10527,they show how many degrees the thing that they're in is,they show how my degrees the thing that there in is
10528,was and if it was the coldest or the warmest,was and if it was the coldest or the warmest
10529,thank you,q
10530,which was the coldest and which was the warmest and which one was in the middle,which was the coldest ant which was the warmest and which one was in the middle
10531,good,good
10532,we can do celsius or fahrenheit these thermometer show celsius,we can do seacius or fairin height these termomiters show salcius
10533,bye,bye
10534,it shows how many degrees that the thing it's in are,it shows how many degrees that's the thing it's in ur
10535,well the orange is really heavy and you have a lot of gram pieces and most of the and i think you should put more green gram pieces into the other the cup on the other side,well the orange is really heavy and you have a lot of gram pieces and most of the and i think you shold put more green gream pieces into the other the cup on the other side
10536,yes,yes
10537,yeah,ia
10538,well that's when you measure water and liquids,well that's when you measure water and liquids
10539,yeah,yeah
10540,well if you didn't have grams you wouldn't really be able to measure food and stuff,well if you didn't have grams you wouldn't really be able to measure food and stuff
10541,measurement is like when you put like um you can measure how much something weighs and how long it is,measurmant is like when you put like um you can measure how much something wazs and how long it is
10542,um you could probably start by putting the orange in one cup,um you could probably start by putting the orange in one cup
10543,um we have been measuring capacity and um when it's not fully to capacity and then we have been learning about weighing stuff,um we have been measuring capassity and um win us not fully to capassity and then we have been learning about wiing stuff
10544,good,good
10545,i have been learning about measurement,i have been learning about measurement
10546,repeat,repeat
10547,the gram pieces are the twenty gram pieces,the green pieces are the twenty gramd pieces
10548,um you could probably get about four twenties and then two tens and that would make um one hundred,um you could probably get about four twenties and then two tens and that would make um one hundred
10549,um kind of but if you try to measure something and then the little ones and some of them are too big you could just use the small one grams and that'll make it better,um kind of but if you try to measure something and then the little ones and some of them are too big you could just use the small one gramps and that wil make it better
10550,gram pieces are well grams are um like a food or something and then yeah,grampieces are well grams are um like a food or something and then yeah
10551,yes,yes
10552,yes,yes
10553,it keep whenever i go whenever i move the mouse up it goes it says a different um number and then it says like zero millimeters or more,it keep whenever i go when ever i moves the mouse up it goes it says a different um number and the it says like zero mill meters or more
10554,at fifty is when it's when you put water a in the thing all the way up to the top,at fifty is when it's when you put water in the thing all theway up to the top
10555,we learned they actually put more in there when you put up to cap capacity but if not if it's not up to capacity they probably put the right amount,we learned they actually put more in their when you put ir up to casi caassity but if not if it's not up to capassity they probably put the right mout
10556,yeah we used this for some of the things,yea i used this first some of the things
10557,you know when you're at capacity when it when there's it's filled all the way to the top,you know when you'r  copascity when it win theres it's filled all the way to the top
10558,well you just ke um you put in the water and you keep pulling it up and then when it gets to the top then you know it's at fifty,well youd just k um you put it in the water n you keep pulling it up and then when it gets to the top dthen you know it's at fifty
10559,we learned,we learned
10560,well that's good if you're trying to if you're trying to measure something that's le that is less than fifty,well that's good if you're trying to if you're trying to measure something that's le that is less than fifty
10561,you know the volume when it's like probably an inch or two inches below the to the top,you know the vlu en it's leg probably an inch or two inches below the t the top
10562,milliliters is another way you can measure water,milltrs is another way you can measure water
10563,well the the most the white one is fifty five the next one is one hundred and the next one is five degrees and then the last one is twenty degrees,oh the the most the white one is fifty five the next one is one hundred and the next one is five degrees and then the last one is twenty degrees
10564,we've been measuring temperatures length capacity and masses,e bin measuring temperatures lame cacitly and masses
10565,well first it was at twenty degrees then it dropped to five degrees then it eventually went up,ow first it was a pinti de grees then a dropd ta five deggrees then abencally run up
10566,i like science very much and science is my favorite learning subject,i like since ver much and since is my favorite laning subject
10567,well a since it's room temperature and if you keep it in the room it'll stay about the same but b it has ice cubes in it so it'll eventually melt in a few hours,we spenc its rum temperture and if you're keeping in the room it l tay about the stang bu be it has ice cuds ani so  i woudn't y meout in a few hours
10568,hundred uh one hundred degrees is boiling point so the water will be boiling,hundred h one hundred degrees is boiling points souh the water will be boiling
10569,well since the ice is cold and if it turns into water first it'll be get a little more colder then get warmer because the ice it gets melted,well since the ice is cold and iff it turns into water first it'll be get a little more cold r than get warmer because the ice gets mounted
10570,temperature is how hot it is or how cold it,temrture is how harinus or how cod it is
10571,when the water,inthe water
10572,good,good
10573,boiling is very very hot,oiling is bilt vey hat
10574,use the dots and lines and and you can get the amount in a way that you can actually understand very well,tas you at an lins an and you can get the amount in the raytay you can actually understand very well
10575,um these two thermometers represent the start and the finish and the start is twenty degrees celsius and the finish is z zero degree celsius,uthese two frmarms will present the stal and the finish and the stol is teny dogre socius and to finish is zoo dogrees a es
10576,robert is inserting one of his fingers into the cup b,oa is incinting one of his fingers into the cup b
10577,well when is well when the water was in room temperature and and oth,wow when i as r in the water was in roo cemprture and
10578,we were trying to figure out which was the coldest and which was the medium and which was the hottest i mean warmest,we we trying o figure which was the course in ritchual the meedium an richuwas the hardest i mean warmest
10579,usually it's well maybe it'll take time for zero degrees to get freezing but if it's like negative ten degrees it'll take about two to three minutes to freeze,yes its r may be a tick time for zoo degrees to ge fezing but if it's lik negative ten egeze  tac about tefe minutes to fes
10580,bye,by
10581,well observations are when you look at things and make graphs and charts about the things and you can get more information about it,well observation ell when you look at fhings al make grafs and toght about the fings and you can get more information about it

10670,bye bye,mr
10671,in gramses that's what you do,in grances that's what you do
10672,the sponge weighs more than nothing,the spunge wais more than nothing
10673,w,
10674,i don't i forget but so i don't know,ittle i forget but so w no
10675,i don't know it's the same weight,kno it's the same way
10676,it's not all the way um wet but it's not all the way,it's not all the way um wet but it's not all the way
10677,the dry sponge weighs three grams,the drie spung twash three grams
10678,that's all we did with sponges,that's all we did with spudges
10679,um that was that project now we're on a different project it's kind of amazing isn't it,um that was that project now were on a different project its kind of amsins ane
10680,the disk weighs more than nothing we're not even doing that anymore we're not using the metal disk or the plastic disk,disquze more than nothing were not even doing that anymore were not using the medal disor the plastic dis
10681,we already did this why do we have to do again i said it's three grams and it is three grams to equal the t,we already did ths why dod way havfe to do it again i said it's three granmdson it is thre grambs to equal the
10682,it's three grams to well dry sponges weigh,it's three gram's to ea well dry spunges wait
10683,good,good
10684,i don't know,i don't know
10685,in the other cup in the other cup,in the other cup and the other cup
10686,they you use em to wipe up spills,they you use them t whipe up spill

10688,i don't know,
10689,sixteen minus three is thirteen,sixteen minus three is thirteen
10690,away,way
10691,we've been weighing wet sponges and dry s,we've been waiting wet spiders and drifes
10692,s that's all we did,that's all we di
10693,h it's one gram amazing,it's orne gran amusing
10694,i don't know,o mo
10695,i don't know,i don't know
10696,the wet sponge weighs sixteen grams and that's not how much a wet sponge weighs it weighs like fifty grams uh,twets on gy sixteen grams and that's not how much a wit iwited it wat is like fifty gram a
10697,it you use um that to measure smaller things and you use kilograms to measure bigger thin,it you use um that's to measure smaller things and you use killgrams to measure bigger thing
10698,i don't know,i don't kn
10699,there's ten grams twenty grams five grams and one gram,come on she's taken so long
10700,one thousand i already knew that,one thousand i arady knew that
10701,it has um,gram's five gram's tan gram's twenty grams and then it's got a thing of water
10702,you'll use fifty and then you use another fifty to make i,you'll use fifty and then you use and ha their fifty to make
10703,we weighed a lemon and it took a s w s two hundred seventy grams to fill it up,we waited a lemam and it took ustwo hundred seventy grams to fill it up
10704,grams and kilogra,grams and callogr
10705,you measure weight and you measure he heavier object,you measure waite and new measure heavyer object
10706,it the um total of how much the boot weighs is one thousand one hundred and twenty gram,it the um totle of how much the boot is is one thousand one hundred and twenty gran
10707,that the picture shows that is it it the weight of the oranges is three hundred twenty five grams,thet the picture shows that is iit the weight of tthe orange is three hundred twenty five grants
10708,it's trying to tell you that it's one thing of water and the rest i don't know,it's trng to tell you that it's one thing of water and the rust i don't know
10709,it's the same answer two for it tw three and three,it the shame answeer two furit two three and three eight and eight
10710,kilogram is one hundred wa and it's ten one hundred bags,cellagram is one hundred one it ten one hundred bags
10711,good,good
10712,a kilogram is one hundred one hun no ten one hundred grams,a kelogram is one hundred one hund ten an hundred grams
10713,the number is higher,the numbers higre
10714,we are i already answered it,clear i already answered it
10715,seventy grams to make it and the picture changes from ones to tens and then that changes to twenties,seven ty gramns to make it and the picture changes from ones to tens and then that changes to its ornis
10716,we haven't started math today,we haven't started matth today
10717,they at least have to be one thousand gram,they at least have to be one thousand gram
10718,we didn't use just our gram pieces to weigh the apple or orange we made the highest was only twenty so we made it a hundred gram se and then we made a kilogram,we didn't use just our grand pieces to le the appler orange we made the highest aly twenty so wev made a a hundred gram nd then we made a killgram
10719,i never said re reference,i never said a reverence
10720,they don't have a hundred gram parts n they only have ones fives tens and twenties,they don't have a hundred granparts they only have ones five tens and twentys
10721,we but we only had um two twenties so we actually only had one twenty two three tens four and four fives so we couldn't make a one hundred gram,we but we only had um two twentys so we actually  only had one twenty two three tens four and four five so we couldn't make a one hundred gram
10722,it tells me that it takes eight grams to fill or to make it level with the metal disk,tells me that it takes a brains t fill or to make it level with the medtal dish
10723,well you can break them down into the gram pieces,well you can break them down into the grand pieces
10724,um we haven't even done anything like that so,um we haven't even done anything like that show
10725,sures people's weight t and to measure like carts and to measure shipping crates and,ures peoples wa into measure like cards into measure shipping crates and
10726,what do you mea,what d m
10727,so just tell me,i don't know what you mean
10728,d i said that the metal disk is eight grams,i said that the medtal disk is eight grams
10729,it takes eight grams to fill up the,it takes at gram's to fill up the
10730,one is bigger and one is smaller,one is bigger and one is smaller
10731,this is a cube that eq and that cube equals one gram s,itsas a kub that eaand that ub bucales on grams
10732,it takes eight grams the ma,takes eight gram's a m
10733,the metal chip is heavier,the meadtal trip is heavier
10734,o the mass of grams equals the thing we measured because you measure things in science by grams,oh the mass of grams equal the thing we measured because you measure things in science by grams
10735,we didn't use our hands with the different objects at all except for when we sa we were trying to do,we didn't use our hands with the different objects at all except for when we thought we were trying to do
10736,i thought i already told you about that,i thought i arady told you about that
10737,they're all the same size,theyere all the same size
10738,what might affect how what weighs,what might effect how what ways
10739,i don't know we just started that,i don't know we just started that
10740,i don't know,i don't know
10741,well we use them,well we use them
10742,o the the plastic disk weighs some and the metal disk weighs some,the the plastic dusk waes some and the mettal dis is some
10743,that wasn't even the answer the answer was three and it's about using paper clips to measure it against the poker chip,that wasn't even the answer the answer was three andits about using paperclips to measur it against the poker chip
10744,use the same size paper clip,is the same size paper clip
10745,paper clips,paper clips
10746,gram cubes,gramg
10747,they just dropped a lotta grams into it to make it,tanger droppd a lot of grams into it to make a
10748,it,it
10749,i forget,i forget
10750,their weight,their wait
10751,heaviest to lightest you just said com something completely different than that,heaviest to lightesh you' just said comsomething complitly different than that
10752,your hands or a weight measurer,your hands are a white masure
10753,because the grams are all the same size of course,because the grams are all the same size f course
10754,bye,bye
10755,that it was light,that it was light
10756,paper clip,paper clip
10757,um i don't know,um i don't know
10758,it messes up your answer,it messes a grams
10759,metal's heavier of course and the plastic chip,mettals havier of course and the plastic trip
10760,m i said that if you use the same size paper clips it won't affect anything because they're all the same size so that won't do anything to the results,i said that if you ouse the same size paper clips it won't effect anything because the're all the same size so that won't do anything to the result
10761,group two has lower numbers because they had the bigger paper clips and group one has bigger numbers because they had the smaller paper clips,group too has lower numbers because they and the vicgr paplips a grup one has bigger numbers because they had the smaller paper clips
10762,it's not accurate because paper clips can be different sizes and different weights,it's not accurite because paperclips could be different sizes in different ways
10763,we didn't wes estimate weight of any other objects we just used the metal disk the poker chip and the piece of wood,we didn't west estinate way of any other object to we just used the medtal disk the poker chip in the pieceof wood
10764,weighs more than the small,wavs more than the smel
10765,we measured the weight of um different objects,we measured the weight of um different objects
10766,good,good
10767,estimate that's all i can s,esc at me at's all looking
10768,i don't know i forget,don't know  i forget
10769,thank you very much,ant you very much
10770,they take counts by one hundreds and it is called a liter,the day count by one hnd weds a et is called a leader
10771,i don't know,i don't know
10772,i already told you about that,i already told you about that
10773,not dumb i'm not dumb we used syringes and we used cups okay,not dup got up ps of bridges and we used cups oh ga a
10774,i don't know,i don't know
10775,well first you put water in and then you take the water out and measure it,ll first you put water in and then you take the water out and measure it
10776,measure um smaller amounts with the syringes we have they're only fifty milliliters not one hundred so the,mesure um smaller amounts but this arange es we have there only fifty nol leaders not one hundred s
10777,i said capacity is the empty cup,i said copassity is the empty cup
10778,it takes two hundred milliliters to fill it with of water,takes two hundred mlators to fill it with of wate
10779,if there's lots a water you use syringes and if there's not a lot a water you use the um,something selonders  gratuated sunders
10780,i didn't have time to do that,i didn't have time to do that
10781,mmm we already did this,we aready did this
10782,oh how are you supposed to know what we were doing,oh how are yous post to know what we were doing
10783,capacity is the empty cup,opassity is the empty cup
10784,the capacity of the cup on the left is bigger than the capacity of the cup on the right,the capascity of cap on the left is bigger than the capasity of the cup on the right
10785,the shape and the volume don't matter be but the size of the um container does,the shape in the volume don't matter b but the size of the umcontainer does
10786,bye,by
10787,i don't know,i don't know
10788,graduated cy,graduated s
10789,the lines on the syringe are how many milliliters there are,the lins onirenger how many millaters there are
10790,that is a syringe and it holds fifty milliliters of water oka,that is us arange and it holds fifty mello leaders of water ok
10791,they can be different shapes but they can hold the same amount of water,they can be different shapes but they can' hold e im am ut of water
10792,good,good
10793,that's two hundred milliliters okay but they're all different sizes,that's two hundred melo leaderoky but the'real different sizes
10794,oh it's a hunded forty two milliliters,oh it's a hundred fourty two fellow leaders
10795,we already did it,e ardy did 't
10796,i don't know,i don't know
10797,put water in it,water in it
10798,well you double line b and there's um two above it so that's,will you dubble line beat and there's um t above it so that's
10799,it goes up to one hundred milliliters,up to one hundred mil leaters
10800,graphs are what you use to collect and store data on,acer what you' used to collect an story daa on
10801,put it either put in ice and our warm wate,putiither puting ice an or putting swamp
10802,bye marnie adios,maraoscris
10803,it should feel um cold but not very very cold,it should fl um cold but not very very cold
10804,i don't know,i don't know
10805,it's different from ours because we only did it ten minutes and the com you wasted it,st different from ours because we only did it ten minutes and the comyugu du t
10806,could count tens or you can count fives or you could count by ones,good cogens evy ls ery good  onc
10807,it is that's the temperature and the one on the bottom is the time,it is that's the temperature and th one on the bottom is the time
10808,it's colder it goes down because they want all the liquid to go to one space so it won't be as cold,s colder it goes down because they want all the liquid to go to once ay so it won't be as cold
10809,um you just watch it and then you see it go down and you know it's the temperature goe,um you'd just watch it and then you see it go down and you know it's the temprature g
10810,war the start one was warm finish one was colder,wor the start wone was warn finished when was called
10811,i don't know i don't know i forgot what you said can you tell me again,i don't know don't know wy forgot hat he said can you teall me again
10812,ah it's so loud even with these on,h at's so loud even with these on
10813,good,god
10814,we did a line graph so you just put a dot there and then you connect the dots it's like connected,we ded a liyograh so you' just put a dot there and then you conect the dots it's like a canep
10815,you can subtract tha,you can sib t
10816,um because if you add it on the same place it wouldn't make sense at all,um because if you adit on the same place it wouldn't make sense at all
10817,uh you just i don't,you just i do'
10818,it goes way down and then it goes up,it gos way down and the it goes up
10819,it goes um it stays at the same temperature,it goes a its days at the same temperature
10820,we've been measuring the temperature of when we add ice to water and see and and making line graphs,we've been measuring the temperature of when we ad ice to water in scea and making my grass
10821,i don't know we already did that,oar
10822,it can freeze,it kan freze
10823,it got colder but once once it's was in there for a while it just kept staying at that same temperature,it got colder but once once it swasin there for a while it just kept staying at that seemed tempature
10824,it they either went way down or just stayed the same,i they either went way down or just ayd the sa
10825,well if you put it in that and if you put it in the other cup and if it's a different and if it's on a different line that means it's a different temperature,holl if you utint in that ine putit in the other cup anif it's b different and if it's on a different line it meansutc  different campr
10826,if you're if you're it and you have,iiien i ro d ni ease i wais ana m i don't la that bottonrt
10827,the one that says start,the one theat'll sa dar
10828,well you can estimate how much it is with your pinkie or thumb or your pinkie or your foot or your hand,well you can estimate how much it is with your pinkour thomg or your pinky or your foot or your hand
10829,you could use your f th pinkie and thumb to measure it or you could use your pinkie because that's about the size of a centimeter,you could use yur pinky and thom to measure it or you could use our pinkey because that's about the size of a sennametor
10830,they all in the in the number zero except for one meter,they all in the in the numbers zerow except for one meeter
10831,by practicing what you really wanna you wanna set a goal your big goal on something you really wanna do or have,lex say for example you want to be a prodancer and you set that as your gol so you would practice a lot and that would be thoutd help
10832,so you know you have so you know that you have the right answer,so you know you have so you know that you have the right answer
10833,i don't know,i don't know
10834,good,good
10835,ten inches long,ten inches long
10836,you can use ye a piece a chalk or you could use a ruler or you can use a piece of plywood or you could use your pinkie your hand,you can use yu a piece of jac or you kin use a ruler or you kin use a piece of fly wood or you coul ech a pink your hand
10837,they they're the metric system and you measure with all of them,the therere the metric sistom and you measure with all of tum
10838,helps you get better at whatever you're trying to be the best at,help you' get better at what ever you'e trying to be the best ac
10839,adios,ardus
10840,in science you have it based on the metric system so in in math you have it based on another system so you yu in the u s a is the only,s country that uses the metric sistom as their cience spaced sistom
10841,it is thirty centimeters long,it is thirty ceveno meters long
10842,what do you mean,what do you mean
10843,i don't know,i don't know
10844,i thought we already went over this,i thought we are went over this
10845,um your pinkies and uh oh yeah your ce um centimeters millimeters um meters,um your pinkies and uh oh yeah your sm cenimetors the limeators m metrs
10846,so there would be four rulers as the snake or you could use the snake as a reference to help measure the blackboard,well if you put the ruler on the snake it would you could use the ruler and put it on the snake and that would be three more rulers and
10847,his foot is as big as his forearm,his foot is as big a his four arm
10848,gotta use um well your pinkie is one centimeter and your pinkie and your thumb is about ten centimeters,gotus um well you'r pinky is one sen ameter and you're pinky and your thum is about ten sentmeters
10849,i don't know,i don't know
10850,that they can be same or they can just be a little bi,that they can be the same were they can just be a little bi
10851,good,good
10852,i don't know,i don't know
10853,it tells you that it's the width is a centimeter,it tells you that it's the with is as sentameter
10854,we didn't measure anything else except for our,wdidn't measure anything else except for our
10855,well you know how wide it is so you know that if it's a centimeter you can use that to measure a table or a computer or your head and stuff like,well you know how whydi so you know that if it's ast sent a meeter you can use that to measure a table or a computer or ayour head and stuffd like
10856,what do you mean about telling you more about that,what do you mean about telling yeow more about that
10857,we don't use millimeters,we don't use mello metors
10858,u can use um yard stick or um a,ou can use um a yard stick or um a
10859,you use em to measure stuff that's shorter not longer because if it's sh longer it will take a long,you use em to measyoure stuff thet shorter not longer because if it's longer itwill take a long
10860,i noticed they're all different s,i noticed thall difference
10861,meter tape because it can go around stuff as the meter stick it's just really solid and you can't get it to ben,metor tape because it can go around stuff ase the meater stick it's just really sollid and you can't get it to ba
10862,really by to your actual height it's about t two centimeters off or zero centimeters off,really close to your actual hight it's about t to sena meeters offer zero sent a meters off
10863,e what do you mean,what do you mean
10864,none were the same,none were the same
10865,the metric,amattric
10866,well they're all there's a line for every cen centimete,well there all there's a lion for every scenme
10867,we only used the meter tape and a meter stick and that's all and we didn't measure our nose,we only used to meet or tape and a metor stick and that's all and we didn't measure our nose
10868,well it if you don't have anything you've gotta use a reference so you can measure but you're not exactly sure if it's exactly precise on,well  if you don't have anything you got to use a reverence so you can measure but you're not exactly sure if it's exactly precice on
10869,arm spanned is the same as his height,arm spand is the same as a si
10870,we haven't measured anything except for our height and our arm,we haven't measured anything except foraw hight in our arm
10871,well you use um different measuring tools to measure it if you don't have measuring tools you should use references,well you use um different measureing toles to measure it don't hat measuringtil shou should use refferences
10872,well we don't use millimeters we only use centimeters,and you will neu center meters for short measurments
10873,listen we haven't used any tools except for a little cup,la sin we haven't used any told except for a little cup
10874,because there's milliliters and liters that's all,cause there's mel leaters and meters that's al
10875,how much water it can hold,how much water it can hold
10876,you get different numbers because some are smaller and then you get higher numbers some are bigger and then you get a bigger number,you get different numbers because sumare smaller and then you get a higher numbers sme are bigger than you get a biggr nomf it
10877,let me see we didn't use any tools okay,let me see we didn't use any tl sok
10878,i don't know i don't know at all,i don't know i don't know at all
10879,we already went over that okay so stop asking me that same ques,we already went over that oks o stop asking be that same quas
10880,that's there's one hundred to a thousand milliliters,at there's one hundred two a thousand milo leaters
10881,what's a liter beaker,at's a leater beager
10882,hmm let me see i think it's the capacity,whom the msh i think i's a capasity
10883,i don't know,i don't know
10884,um let me see i've only used them today,um mammy sa i've only used them today
10885,um a milliliter is something you can meas used to measure capac,m amilalater i something you can meas use to measure capas
10886,there is less than a milliliter okay so,aas less than to mlo leade oka obea
10887,by using milliliters and liter,by using no leaters ind eater
10888,we've been measuring capacity,od measuring copasity
10889,to measure capacity of water,te measure capassity of water
10890,i don't know,i don't know
10891,i don't know i don't know i don't know i don't know,kno i don't knoi don't know
10892,hey we didn't use graduated cylinders we used cups okay so and it took wa ten of those to do it,hey we didn't use grattulated cillenders we used cups okay so in its  ten of those to do it
10893,we used a different measuring tool can we leave can we leave,we used to different measur in toutle can weleave can we leave
10894,hey listen to me are you deaf i said we haven't use any tools yet,hey listen to me are you deff i said we haven't used anatles yet
10895,um let me see they measure how much water there is in it,m lam m s the measure how much water  there is in it
10896,l let me see i think group one's is bigger and group two is the smaller of course,me m she i keep goop on is bigger and god gin  smaller of course
10897,good,good
10898,um we didn't use an empty cup,yeu didn't use eca
10899,listen to me we didn't use those okay,i said may we didn't use those oka
10900,the capacity of water or a liquid,the copassity of water or liqquad
10901,what do you mean,what do you mean
10902,there are one thousand,there are one thousand
10903,i don't know and when are you gonna say goodbye i'm getting kinda tired,i don't know an winter you gong to say good bye am getting kind of tiere
10904,um if three groups did two hundred and then one group did four then,ecit um if three groups did two hundred and then one group did four then
10905,so tha um what we did um why that was about was because mmm,so that um what we did um why that was about was because
10906,yeah,mayah
10907,yeah,yeah
10908,the bitch,vange
10909,yeah hmm mmm hmm,yah no
10910,yeah,yeah
10911,we also so did um what you ca um we did uh,we also did m chuum we did u
10912,no,no
10913,um the most surprising and interesting one the um that we've done is probably,um the most surprising and interesting one that um that we've done is probearly
10914,it was actually like two hundred and some over it was actually three hundred and fifty i think and the can said um tw uh um three hundred and sixty five,it was at she liked two hundred and sm over it was at se three hundred and fifty i think an the cand said um t um three hundred and sixty five
10915,yeah but i could test it so yeah,yeah but i could test it sir yeah
10916,the most interesting,the most interesting
10917,that they did two hundred millimeters each,that they did two hundred milo meetors each
10918,and i actually found out that water is actually um actually is um one of the things in the world that has the most mass water has so much mass,and a he found out that water is that shee um atree is um one of the things in the world that has the most mass water has so much mass
10919,yeah we did,ye we did
10920,yeah,yeah
10921,we,we our
10922,and she lied,tat she like
10923,um what's capacity,um what's capasity
10924,milliliters are one um is one percent out of this this is a hu thousand percent out of one of these so a thousand of th m milliliters would equal to a liter,mlilaters are one m is one percent out of this this is a thousand percent out of one of these so a thousand of milleaters would equal to a leater
10925,i th yeah i think it is,i teh i think it is
10926,yeah,o
10927,a little um uh yeah we had little coke cans and other things that we measured in and we could see how much it had um how much it totals and we could see if it was lying or not and the coke can was actually lying,a lo um u yea we had lo coak cans and other things that we measured it and we could see how much it had am a how much it told ous and we could see if it was flying ore not and the coa can was at she lying
10928,yeah so,ca
10929,a hu a thousand,e hud thousand
10930,milliliters liters,the leaterleaters

10949,um we um measured with grams which is a very good standard,um we um measured with grams which is a very good standerd
10950,yeah,yah
10951,um i com i didn't really compare that much yeah,um i can i didn't really comparthat much yeah
10952,i hope we can yeah we do,i hop we can yehme d
10953,i readed that because twenty's right there and then you can tell that it's just below twenty barely s which means that it's nineteen even though you can't see these spots clearly ten,i read it that because twenty's right there and then you can tell that it's just below twenty bearly which means that it's nineteen even though you can't see these spots clearlytent
10954,um i haven't actually done that now before i this the first day we've actually done it,um i have ant at e done that now before n this the first day we batch he done it
10955,how to read this alright well start is about,how to read these ll right well start is about
10956,yeah,yeah
10957,so it started off warm and then it started going slower and going down,so it started off warm and then it started going slower and going down
10958,yes mmm hmm yes,yes yes
10959,yeah and milligrams and kilograms yeah,yeah and miligrams and killgram s
10960,yes we used these,yes we use these
10961,yeah,yeah
10962,yes,yes
10963,thirty f um thirty two degrees celsius but if i said that in fahrenheit it will be below freezing,thirty um thirt two degrees sacius but if i said that in far an height it wild be below freezing
10964,mmm hmm mister pearler told us that we were going to do graphs,mr purler told us that we were going do grafs
10965,yeah,yp
10966,but that's weight mass e yeah so,but that's wag mass ye so
10967,yeah,yeah
10968,since,sen
10969,yeah,yeah
10970,the ma,the mat
10971,yeah,ge
10972,yeah no it was actually um and then we had questions is this the best way to use it of course not so yeah and i got four on that one,yeahno it was that cy um and then we'e had questions is this the best way to use it of course not so yeah and i got four on that one
10973,yeah i love measurement,yeah i love measure meant
10974,well i basically already told you all of the things,well i' basiclarri told you all f the things
10975,yeah,yeah
10976,yeah,ye
10977,yeah cause um water has a lot and a lot of mass so do other liquids yeah,yeah cause  water has a lawt in a law of mass so do other liquids yeah
10978,no no not really grams no i don't,no no not really grams know i don't
10979,yeah,ya
10980,um what did you mean,um what did you mean
10981,um the motor is spinning um because the electricity is creating the motor to spin,um the motor is spinning um because the lectriscity is creating the motor at spe

10996,you must have energy go through the wires and come out the wires,you must have energy go throughthe wires and come out the wir
10997,well we've been studying energy and electromagnetism,well we've been seddying elect the ennergin electral magnatisom
10998,it would not work um because there is no sunlight for um it to make electricity from,it would not work because u there's no sunlight for um it to make allectricity from
10999,the switch has to be closed,this witch has to be close
11000,take the suns rays and turn it into electricity,a the suns raise and turn it into lectricit
11001,i notice that when you open it it doesn't work and when you close it it does work,i notice that when f you open it it doesn't work and when you close it it does work
11002,it makes the motor move and it makes the gears inside the motor turn which makes the shaft rotate,it makes the motor move and it makes the gears inside the moter turn which makes the shaft rotate
11003,no,no
11004,thank you so much,thank you so m
11005,it uh it can not complete a full circuit,its the eit dosn't it cannot complet a full circt
11006,there is no electricity in the circuit power the motor,there's no lectriscity in the circlt poer the moto

11018,i can see all the like little molecules of energy flowing through them and the evidence is you can see the light,i can see all the llike little mallcues of anergy floing through them and the evidance is you can see the light
11019,they burn out faster,they burn out faster
11020,in series circuits you have two batteries usually and two light bulbs and it can complete a full circuit and it will produce,it' sery circuts you have  two batteryes usually in two light bulbs and it can complete a full circut and it will produce um a lot a
11021,it is flowing in a pathway to create a circuit,it is flowing um in a u pathway um to create a circuet
11022,they don't work because no energy can come out of them it's just the energy's running into each other,they don't work because no energy can come out of them thereit's just the energy i's running into each other
11023,it is flowing through the light bulbs,it is flowing through the light bulbs
11024,the circuit is creating a pathway for the energy to flow through the circuit,the circete is creating a pathway for the ennergy to flow through the circut
11025,the light bulbs glowed brighter,um the light blubs gum glowed brighter
11026,it has to go through the light bulb,it has to go through the light ball
11027,it flows through the circuit to create energy i mean to create a source of light power or movement,it flows through the circet to create energy a man to create a source of light powur or movement

11033,it's also um what makes it what's a light bulb is the thing that produces light with the energy that the d cell battery uses,it's allso um what makes it what's a lih bl bs the thing that prorducses light with the energy that that they sell better e come uses
11034,it means to me that we can see things and that it's like little radio waves going through the battery and into the light bulb,it means to me that we can see things and that it's like little radeo waves going through the battery and into th lip
11035,there's one the positive side has a little nub on it and the negative side is flat,there is one the positive size has a little nub on it and the neggutive side is flat
11036,i am so good,i am so good
11037,it basically a light bulb except it's just a scientific word for it,it basicaly means a lighe bull bitcept is just a scientific worord for it
11038,that it will give energy,that it will give energy
11039,it is flowing upward toward the light bulb,it is flowing upward towards the light bold

11086,each one does something different and that's what makes it really cool,each one does something different and that's whati makes it really cooal
11087,when you add an insulator the motor will not run or the light bulb will not turn on,when you ad an instilater the moter will not run or the light bulb will not um turn o
11088,when you put objects like a rock on there the motor does not turn but when you put something on there like an aluminum nail it does work,when you put objects like a rock on their the moter does not turn when you put something on the're like a eloominap nail it does work
11089,they do not allow electricity through i think i think that's right but i don't know now let's get back to the math,they do not alow aclectricitys throat i think i think that's right but i don't want the last to get back to the mass
11090,we have been working with circuits and figuring and finding conductors and insulators,we have ben um working with circuets and figuring and finding conductors um and u inselators
11091,each time you check an object that will do something and it,each time you check an object that will do something in a
11092,they don't conduct electricity and they it just doesn't allow electricity to go,they don't conduct electricity and they um it just doesn't allow c electricity to go t
11093,it does not allow electricity to go through and therefore the motor does not,it um does not allow alectrisity to go through um and therefore the moter does not
11094,i see that the sun is on the solar panel which is causing the motor to move,i see that the sun is on the soer pandal which is collaring the motov  move
11095,it gets polluted,it gets balouoted
11096,there's lights and you can feel it and you can also see,there's light and you can feel it and you can also s

11103,she's using energy to eat to walk up a hiking trail,she's using energy to eat um um to walk up a higing
11104,it becomes polluted,it becomes baluted
11105,they're using food inside their body to create energy which helps them tap,they are using food inside their um body to creat ennergy it was help some tap th
11106,i am very bad how,i am very bad heth
11107,it didn't really sound like anything it just sort of sounded like something was melting or like something was flying through the air or something like that,it didn't really sound like anything it' just sort of sounded like something was melting or like something was flying through the air or something like th
11108,they do not pollute the air,they do not plue the a
11109,going down which means it's burning and the wax is melting,' going down which means it's burning t's an it's on the wax taltic
11110,i don't i can't hear you,i don't i can't hear
11111,it felt really hot you will feel what are you doing it feels really really hot it feels really hot when you do that,ireally itisreally really  it feels really hot when yud do that
11112,would they would pollute the air,wuld they would pult the air
11113,fossil fuels,fosafield
11114,i see a candle and it's burning and wax is going down,i see a canal it's bana and wax is going down

11116,she's eating something to create energy,she's eating something to create
11117,they'll create energy and i see gasoline coal wood a wind mill a solar panel,tank they ll creat energy and i see gassling cold wood a wind knill a um soer pana
11118,the wick is on fire and it's creating energy,acx the wic is on fire and it's creating entergin
11119,when the flame moves it looks like the air candles moving because it's burning lower and lower,when the fline moves it looks like the air on the candale s moving because it's burning lower and lower
11120,it produces heat and energy,it puruces um heats and energy
11121,there's sound and the energy in your body is creating,theres sound and the enterginiou body is coreate
11122,there every single one will pollute the air differently and some won't pollute the air thank you bye,they'r every single one ether will plut the air differently and some won't palut their thank you by
11123,i don't,i don
11124,it is burning,its brning
11125,yes you do at sometimes,yes you do at sometimes
11126,some do pollute and some don't pollute,some do lute and some don't pal
11127,they would pollute the air which would kill things,they would plut the air which would kill thing
11128,i see wood a candle apples and gasoline,ic he would a candle apples and guess th
11129,come,om
11130,you would um you would wait for the alcohol inside to go finish going up or finish going down then you would read the temperature o,yo would um you would wait for the alcaall inside to go finish going up bor finish going down and then you would read the temperature
11131,we read,we read
11132,um that sammy and jesse both thought a was the a was the hottest c was in between and b was cold pat um got a different answer which was c that was the hottest a was in between and b was cold,jammy billy and robbe all got the same answer which was see a beoh ye
11133,good,coud
11134,okay,ok
11135,thanks,thanks
11136,y,
11137,well you place it sort of in the middle not to the side because if you put ice cubes in there it might be touching an ice cube and you would get different measurements or something so you just put it in the middle,o you place it sort of in the middle not t the side because if you put ice kees in there it might be touching an ice kepe an you would get t different measurments or something so you'd just put it in the middle
11138,like well we can measure the temperature of water we can measure the temperature of the air around us we can measure the temperature of the soil and we can measure our body temperature,like well we can measure the temperature of watere we can measure the temperature of the air around us we can measure the temperature of the soil and we can measure our body temperature
11139,well thermometers can um determine the exact temperature and you can make a pretty good gue and you can make a more educated guess or you can know,well thermometeurs can um deturmin the exact temperature and you can make a pretty good gues and you can make a more egecated guess or you can know
11140,i think it's the degree that water boils at,one hundred degrees is
11141,well there's little numbers on the side and you read the temperature there,well tho'se little numbers on the side and you read the temperature there
11142,yeah we had that in our class that and then we used thermo,yeah we had that in our class that and then we used thei'r mom
11143,i think that's the measurement,i think that's the measurment
11144,you too,u to
11145,okay now i understand it,oky now i understand it
11146,the metal disc was eight grams,the meddal disk was eight gramps
11147,oh yeah today we measured how much water a sponge can take up,oh ye today we measured how much water a spunge can take up
11148,we used grams because,w use grams because
11149,um yeah that's basically yeah,um yeah that' spacically yeah
11150,good,good
11151,well grams are the basic measurement that you use,well grams are the baic measurment that you use
11152,okay thanks,ok thanks
11153,well a kilogram is a thousand grams so you have to make ten one hundred gram bags to get a kilogram,well a killgram its a thousand gramps so you havto make ten one hundred grand bags to get a killegram
11154,you move it around the box to try and find the magnet,e moved er around the box to try to find the magnet
11155,you move it around the box,tmova rom the box
11156,there's a there there's a magnet inside you have to try to find it,the result there there's a magnet and saou hav to try to find it
11157,inside the box,inside the box
11158,it would have touched to the magnet,the wo touch to the magnet
11159,yeah,yu
11160,there's a magnet in the box,there's a magnet in b
11161,something's will work and something's that won't work like this bunch won't work and the spring will work,somethings will work in something that won't work like the spunge won't work and a pring will work
11162,there's a motor a battery a wire trying to trying to turn on the motor,there's aoer beatterty and a wie an they tr to trin to turn on the moter
11163,some of them are metal and some of them aren't,ome thr metal and some of them aren't
11164,because the metal thing you have to put it near the wires and the motor will start working,because the meddle ting you have to put it near the wires and the motur wl start working
11165,good,good
11166,when you put the spring near the wires the motor will start going,when you put the spring near the wires the moter wastart going
11167,i think it's going to take less washers to break that,tincan take as wash to break the
11168,the washers f fell down and the magnet's going up,the washer fell down in the magnets goin up
11169,we put we just dropped it inside,est dropped  inside
11170,we put them all in the cup and we also used the washers and the spacers and see how much we use,we put them on in the cup and we also used the washers a in the spaces wont we put us se how much we use
11171,there's spacers um there's spacers in the cup and a magnet in a cup,ther spacers ther spacers in a coop and a magnet in a cook
11172,a magnet washers and spacers,a magnet wash ersend spicers
11173,well one's inside and the other ones outside of the cup,on once inside an te was outside of  cup
11174,show me a picture with one spacer in it,show me a picer was an spicer in it
11175,good,good
11176,yes,yu
11177,yes,yes
11178,the battery,the betterd
11179,i mean the minus sign,i mean the mensing
11180,different,it
11181,good,good
11182,yes,yus
11183,two light bulbs are bright and two light bulbs aren't aren't bright,to nppubs are brgtand two nipples aaren't bright
11184,it has a plus and a minus sign,at as a posnmon thing
11185,the battery and wires,a baroun wi
11186,nothing,nothing
11187,yes,yes
11188,how electricity flows through the battery and light bulbs,how the ectriscity fell tu the better thand i pops
11189,a circuit i think is when two light bulbs work when two light bulbs work,a circuy i think it is when to night both work wen to night both work
11190,the battery,the bay
11191,it has a plus and minus sign,i had the person minnuca
11192,when it lights up,when e ights up
11193,because it has a wire cause the wire is go is going through the light bulb,because it has the wire as a wirin a go going through the t npple
11194,the plus sign,t pin
11195,good bye marnie,goodbye morning
11196,if one bulb stays on then one bulb if one bulb um turns off and then the other bulb will s um um stay on,if one p stays on then one b if one bu um turns off nd then the other b wll um um stay on
11197,it all means that there are,a means that the a cos
11198,we've been working with magnets trying to light up light bulbs and trying to make um motor's work,he've been working wih magnets trying to nite u night buls and trying to make um moters wick
11199,there's one battery two light bulbs and a wire's try the wires um lighting up the light bulb,there's one bater to ny bobs and a wise tring te wie dum niting up the night bok
11200,can i see the other picture again,caan i see the other picture o
11201,one wire's um,one lage
11202,um two light bulbs are lighting with one battery,um two nip bobs are niting with one batter
11203,good,good
11204,it's important because uh one wire's one wire's lighting one light bulb and the other wire's lighting the other light bulb,it's mpetant because  one wis one wirs niting one pp and the othe wise niting the other nipal
11205,yes,yes
11206,the positive side and the other one's on the negative side and the negative side where the wires goes through the metal and to the positive side,the positive side and the oons on the neggutive side and the neggutive side where the wirs go through the medta an to the posite side
11207,i have two,i have to ro
11208,there's only one wire on the battery and two wires where the light bulb is,thres only on wa i better than tice weresin ni bupes
11209,yes two light bulbs and one battery,ther two i pul theam one better
11210,can i see the other one again,can i s the other one again
11211,hmm it's a little different,it's a little different
11212,light bulb,w
11213,i took the meter stick and i pretended that there is two and then so then it looked like it would be t about two meter sticks long,i took the meators stick and i pretended that there were to and then sin look like it would beets about two meeater sticks long
11214,we measured it with um with um meter sticks and decimeters and um centimeters,we measured it with um with um meator sticks in desi meaters and um sid the meators
11215,mmm you measure yourself and then i can't remember,you measure yourself and then i can't remember
11216,um i've been learning about measurements,doctor i tel  to wa yu  d um i've been learning about measurment
11217,one meter long,one meetor long
11218,um i've been doing like i've been measuring our body and different parts of it,um i've been doing like i've been measuring our body in different parts of it
11219,well it was fun cause we got to learn like how be how long our arm span is and how tall we are and like how long our foot is and it was really fun,well it was fun bcause we gots learing like how bit how long our arms spandas and how tall we are and like how long our foot is mosreally fun
11220,two meters long,two meaters long
11221,he's measuring how long he is,s measuring how long he is
11222,you tr use your math skills you try to guess what what how much something is or what the answer is,you you use your masckales you try to guess what what how much something answer what the answer is
11223,yes,yes
11224,yes,yes
11225,a decimeter a centimeter and a meter,a deimeator a scentametor and a meetor
11226,i mean you take the meter stick and you put it on the end of the the meter stick on the floor and then you put and then you keep measuring and then you know how much he is,i mean you take the meetors stick and you put it on the end to the meustic on the floor and then you put nd then you keep measuringelingg you know how much he is
11227,finger,finger
11228,because the space that doesn't have the meter stick it'll that part looks like the same amount that the meter stick is,because the space that doesn't have the meater stick iin that part looks like the same amount that the meter stick is
11229,you're measuring his finger so it's eleven centimeters,you'e measuring his fingers so it's eleven senttmeters
11230,that i was correct,that i was correct
11231,how long he is,how long he is
11232,um i think learning about how you how long something is or yeah,um i think learning about how you how long something is rya
11233,you put the end of the meter stick on the floor and then you count each centimeter and then you bring the meter stick up and then you know how much it is,you put the end of the beater stick on the floor and then you count each sind af metor and then you bring the muol stick up and then you know how much i is
11234,centimeters are about how that's another tool you can use to measure something,sonde menrsear about how that's another chill you coan use to measure something
11235,i don't know,i don't know
11236,so we know how hot or cold something is,so we know how hat or cold something is
11237,could meas they're measuring how hot or cold it is,yur measer measuring how hat on cold it is
11238,we've been doing capacity and the temperature of water,wevben do in capassity and the temperature of water
11239,i think it's sixty degree celsius because fifty degree celsius plus ten degree celsius equals sixty degree celsius,i think it's six dutye salcis because fifty deagree salci as plus ten degree salci us equal  sixty dagree sulcius
11240,i think that if one cup is fifty degree celsius and one is ten degree celsius they'll go together and then it'll be sixty degree celsius,i think that if one cup iis fifty degree socius and one s ten degree scius will go together and then tel be sixty degree seci us
11241,because maybe the waters the temperatures maybe because they were different they ended up being a different things and different temperature instead of sixty,because maybe the water the temperatures me because they were different theyanted up being a different things in he different temperature insead of sixty
11242,that sometimes we measure stuff it could be a different answer than what you really think,that sometimes when you measured stuff it can be a different anch and what you really think
11243,we took a thermometer and we put in the water and we measured it with um celsius,we took as thermomature and we put in the water and we measured it with um selcias
11244,yes,yes
11245,um they're pouring water into the um cup,on their poring water into the um cup
11246,good,good
11247,we measured the water with how hot or cold the water is,we measure the water with how hat ir cold the water is
11248,the solar panel will get enough sunlight and then the motor will run,the sler panda will get enough sunlights and then the motor will run
11249,well the sun rays go onto the solar panel and then when the wires are if they're connected to a motor something the motor will start to run if there is enough sun,well the sun rase go on to the soller panda and then when the wires are cif they're conected to a motor something the moter will start to run if there is enough sun
11250,that the motor is running because energy is now flowing again thanks to the circuit,that the motor is running cause energy is now flowing again thanks te circet
11251,it depends like if it is partly cloudy it will maybe still run but if it's really cloudy and can't really see the sun then no,it depends like if it it is partly cloudy it wl maybe still run but if it's really cloudy can't y see the sun then know
11252,energy and electricity,energy and electrisity
11253,well it is sending out electricity through the wires to the negative side and then back to the positive side,well it is sending out alectrisity through the wire so the negutive side and then back to the positive side
11254,that it is sunny enough so the solar panel is getting enough sunlight for the solar panel to run,that its sunny enough so the soller pandal is getting enough sunlight for the moter to run
11255,the wires have to be um to be attached to the solar panel so then the solar panel will get light will get sunlight and then the motor will start to run,the wiers have to be a tri um to be attached to the soller pandas so thet the soller pandal will get light well get sunlight and then ththe motor will start to run
11256,the um the um solar panel won't get enough um sunlight so the motor won't run,the um the sum silber panda won't get enough um sunlight so that the moter won't run
11257,the solar panel is not getting enough sun so the the motor is will stop running,the soller pandal is not getting enough sun so the fla the motor is stop will stop running
11258,it turns sunny again and the motor is running,it turns sunny again and the motors running
11259,electricity is flowing um to the motor by the wires,ani mean electriscity is flowing um to the motor by the wieres
11260,it is off so the electricity is flowing through the wires,it is off so the electrisity is flowing through the wires
11261,well we yesterday we were using these solar panels and see if if we had enough sunlight to see if the motor will run from the solar panel,well we yesterday wev wen using te soller pandals and see if if we had enough sunlight to see if the motor weill run from the soller pandal
11262,the motor is running cause there is a lot of sun,the motor is runningcause there's a lot of sun
11263,good,good
11264,what,what
11265,no electricity flows,no lectrisity flows
11266,electromagnetism,electral magnetsom
11267,bye marni,by marny
11268,well the circuit needs to be on in the right um place and then the wires are connected which will make the motor run,well the circet needs to be ont in the right place and then the wires are conected which will make the umotor run
11269,that um it that it it lit up the two times on the side but when it's both in the bottom it didn't light up,that um it's that it lt it lid up the two times on the side but when it's both in the bottom it didn't light up
11270,it is going the other direction,it is going the other direction
11271,the negative side,the negutive sige
11272,electricity flows um from the wire to light bulb and then back to and then light bulb to the d cell,alectursity flows um from the wire to light boll and then back to and then light bull to them de so
11273,well they have um energy stored up in them,well they have um energy stored up in the m
11274,so then um when it gets the energy from the wire it will light up,so then um when it gets the energy from the wire it will light up
11275,wires a light bulb and a d cell battery,wires a light bulg in a deeail battery
11276,the um negative is flowing to the light bulb and then it is and then it energy is coming back to the plus,the u neggutive is flowing to the light bold and then it is n more than energyes coming back to the plus
11277,we have been um learning about energy and,we have been um learning about electenergy and electro ma
11278,well they will transfer energy or electricity to something to like a light bulb so it can light up,well they will transfer energy or electrisity to some thing t like a light bub silkand light up
11279,they um they carry um they make it carry,bey um they carry uum the make it carry um electure
11280,because it um will transfer it like the energy to a light bulb,because it um will transfere it laht the energy to a light b
11281,bye,by
11282,good,good
11283,um i think it means like um that it's kind of like a cycle a little bit cause it goes from the d cell it's getting more energy when it goes,um i think it means like um that it's kind of like a sical a little bit cause it goes sound the deesels geting more energy when it goes
11284,it is moving right to left so um like when it gets back and it gets back into the,it is moving right to lea so um like when it gets back and tet gets back into the
11285,energy,energy
11286,so from the wire it moves up to the light bulb from the wire and then it'll come back up and it'll go like to the plus side,so from the wire it moves up to the light bull from the wire and then itl come back up and i'll go t like the plus signe
11287,that the energy is always going from into the light bulb and then out to the light bulb and out of the light bulb into the positive side,that the ennergy is always going from into the light bol and then out to the light bole and out of the light bol into the pousitive side
11288,so from the negative side it is flowing towards the light bulb and then it will from the light bulb go to the positive side,so from the neggutive side it is flowing towards the light bol and then it will from the light bull go to the positive side
11289,that the energy is moving from the d cell battery to the light and then back to to the d cell battery,that the energy is moving from the dia battery to the light and then back to to the te gial batter
11290,it means like that you can um carry the like for example like you can transfer the d cell to the wire and that will receive the um the the d cell,it means like that you can um carri the like frnamed example um like you can transer the decell to the wire and to wi'll receve the um pa th de
11291,it is still going the same way as the other,it is still going the same way as the other
11292,um that you kind of have to rearrange the wires but it would still flow,um that you kind of had to just rerange the wires but it woulds still slow
11293,well first of all since it's flipped it is going the other way and um that um what did you say again,well first of all of psince it's slipp tit is going the other way and um that um what did you say again
11294,they um they have light so then you can see and all that so yeah,they um they have light so then you can see im and all that so ye
11295,when when one of the parts are are lighting up that means it's one of the systems in the car,n en ne of the parks are are lighting u that means it's one of the sistoms in the c
11296,for an example a car is a system it is made of many systems to make the car work,yorn example a car is a sistome and is nade of many sistomes to make the car work

11329,you hear like you hear a slap whenever you hear the guy hit the drums,you hear liyou hear aslap whenever you hear um begi hit the drums
11330,yes because fire was just there so it's energy so it feels a little warm,yes because fire was just there so it's energy so it feel its a little warm
11331,well it didn't really make that much noise,well it didn't really make that much no
11332,energy,energy
11333,because it's getting energy from the sun well well not the sun but the solar cell is doing it and the wind can control with the wind,because i's getting energy from the sun well  um o' not the sun but the soller sl isn it and the wind can controll with the wind
11334,no,no
11335,well the gasoline will pollute the earth but if you will use a wind mill it gets energy and it will actually be better for the earth,well theas n we will plue the rs but if you use a wind mail it gets energy and it'll actuall be better for the earth
11336,it will pollute the earth cause it's bad for it cause it's fossil fuels,it will plut the earth because it's bad fort bcause it's fossil fields
11337,well coal is usually used for is usually used for trains and you use coal for electricity and gasoline you use it for cars,well um col as usually used for um is usually used ftrains and you use cool for electrisity and gasleen u use it for cars
11338,it will pollute the air,it will tlose the air

11341,well we've been going to different stations learning about energy,well we'e ben going to different stations learning about energy
11342,is that food gives you energy cause there's calories in it and that makes you hike and run,'s that food gives you energy cause there's coweres in it a that makes you um hike and run
11343,because she is hiking and she's eating an apple which giving her energy to hike,because um she is hiking and she's eting an apple so it's getving her energy to hike
11344,it will well like i said it will be better for the earth because of the wind mill,well um well i ha said um it'll be better for the earth cause of the wind mail
11345,it has well fossil fuels,um it has um well fossilfields
11346,well you see gasoline which will actually pollute the earth you see wood which people cut down trees and apples and a candle,well you see gass lean which will actully pu the ear you see wood which people cut down trees and apples in a candle
11347,because gas and coal create global warming and that's not good animals can get extinct from that and that's not good,because gass and hole create globre warming and that's not good animals can get extint from them that's not good
11348,well to if you eat food it will give you energy to walk and move around and that's a good thing,well um to move um if you eat food i'll give you anercheet to walk and move around and that's a good thing
11349,bye,by
11350,it will actually be bad for the earth and it'll and it also causes global warming warming,it will actuly be bad for the earth and te cloud and it also causes globl warning warning
11351,it getting energy,you're getting energy
11352,it will save a lot of energy because they don't it doesn't have fossil fuels and it just needs to shine on the solar panel,it ll save a lot of energy because they don't they doesn't have fossil feels and it just needs the sun to shine on tusciler panne
11353,i think that the girl's having energy cause she's eating an apple right now so she's has a lot of energy to hike up the hill,i think that the girls hum having energy cause she'sis eating the appl oright now soy she has a lot of energy to hike up the hill
11354,it got water and sunlight but the plant did didn't get enough air plants can not survive plants can not survive without air,it got water in h sunlight but the plant di didn't get enough air plants cannot survive i know  lants cannot survive without
11355,yes because all living organisms depend on food sunlight and water,yes because all living orgonisoms depend on food sunlight in water
11356,one is getting older and one is perfectly the same,one is getting older and one is perfectly the same
11357,yes because uh because the plants can have cause the plants need nutrition with the fertilizer and it'll help the plants grow not all plants need fertilizer,yes becausebecause the plants can have cause the plants need to new trision with the furtaliser and 'll help the plants grow not all plants need vurtaliser
11358,this plant has been getting water air and sunlight plants need all those things to survive so now the plant is a happy healthy plant,this plant has been gtten water air in sunlight plants need all those things to survive so now the plant is a happy healthy plant
11359,it means the plant has enough of everything and the plant can survive,it means the plant has enough of everything and the plant can survive
11360,in the picture the yeast is rising,in the picture the east is rising
11361,plants can not survive with sunlight and it if it don't have enough sunlight it will not grow so getting water and air so the plant is not,plants can not survive with sunlight in it i has no sunlight it will not grow thea bingting water in air so the plant is lound
11362,because it has been getting sunlight air and water,because it has been getting sunlight air in water

11367,the um the plant has enough water and air but it had too much sunlight so the plant shriveled up,the uthe plant has enough water and air but it had too much sunlight so the plants ribbled up
11368,because the one on the left is dried up the one on the right is not dried up,because the one on the left is riged up the one on the right is is not dried up
11369,because the because if the plant doesn't have water the plant will shrivel up and then if the plant does get lots of water it will die,because the because if the plant doesn't have water the plant will srvup and then if the plant doesn't get o o water it will die
11370,it got too much sunlight,it got too much sunl
11371,it didn't get enough enough water enough air but got too much sunlight which made the plant shrivel up,it didn't get enough as enough water enough air but got too much sunlight which made the plant shrivle up
11372,yes plants need air to survive because all living organisms need air so they can breathe if plants if if living organisms don't have air they will die,yes plants need air to survive because all living orgonisoms need air so they can breethe if plants if if living orgonisoms don't have air they will die
11373,plants need air to survive so the plants can breathe,plants need air to survive so the plants can bre
11374,first we talked about yeast rising then we talked about plants and what they need to survive then we talk about the food chain and food webs,first we talked about east rising then we talked about plants and what they need to survive then we talked about the food chain and food webs
11375,the plants are growing right now and and one is light green and one is a different kind of green,the plants are growing right now and and one is like green and one is a different kind of gre
11376,the plant didn't get any air the plant didn't the plant didn't get any air and since it didn't get any air it shriveled up cause it couldn't breathe,the plant didn't get any air the lant didn't the plant didn't get any ir it sid ididn't gett any air it shrivled up because it couldn't breathe
11377,yes plants do need that,yes plants too need that
11378,the plant breathe and if they can't have enough oxygen the plant will shrivel up and die,the plant can't breathe and thif the cannt have enough oxygen the plant will shrivel up and die

11409,that the that the one d cell is the perfect amount of washer but two d cells is goes really really high which is a little too much,that the rht  the one d sell is the perfect amount of waters but towo desells is gos really really high which is a little too much
11410,when you when you decrease the number of winds then it will also decrease the number of washers because there is not as much electricity going through the rivet,when youwhen youd decreace the number of wines then it will also discreece the number of waseres because there is not as much alectrisity going through the ribbens
11411,then there'll be more electricity going through um the rivet so that means so when there is a hundred winds there is thirty washers on the rivet,then there will be more electrisity going through m the riverso that mean so when there's a hundred ine thir's thirty waters on the river
11412,um with one um and the other side is washer,um with one um and the other side is washr
11413,since there is two um but when there is only one d cell it is not as strong because there is not as much electricity,since there is to um but when there is only one deesell it is not as strong because there is not as much alectrisity
11414,okay,ok
11415,by wrapping the wire more and more around the rivet,by rapping the wire more and more around the ribbern
11416,the more there is the more winds there are then the more then the more washers will pick up because there is more electricity running through the rivet,the more there is the more wines there are then the more than the more wasers will pick up because there is more electricity running through the river
11417,it tells you how many um wire wraps and washers,it tells you how many um wire raps and waters
11418,electromagnets are um are um are are are um kind of like rivets that have electricity flowing into them,electro magnets are um ar ct ara magare um kind of like ribbins that have electricity flowing int
11419,you see the wire wraps,ea see the wire rapts
11420,that ten washers will pick up three i mean um the rivet will pick up three washers when there is ten winds but the more times it is wined around the more washers that will stick onto the rivet,that ten washers will pick up three i mean um the river will pick up three wasers when there's ten wines but the more times it is wind around the mortal washers that will stick on to the riv
11421,that the number of washers is getting higher,that the number of waters is getting higher
11422,more time it is the more times it is wrapped around the rivet the more washers it will pick up,more time it is the more times it is rappt around the river the more washers it will pick up
11423,that the wire has to be connected to a battery and a switch,that the wire has to be connected to a battery and a switsh
11424,what did you say,what did he sa
11425,it has the number of of winds on a chart with two d cells and one d cell,it has the number of two of ines on a chart with two desells ind one deesel
11426,on the graph two d cells goes up to thirty which is really high but with the one d cell only goes up to fifteen,on the grass tw desals gos up the thirty which is really high but with the one d sa i only gos up to fiftt
11427,great,great
11428,when there when there is two batteries it makes the electricity stronger so there'll be a lot of washers going on the rivet,when therewhen there is two batteriyes it makes the electristo be stronger so ther'll be a lot of washeres going on the river
11429,that it is stronger than one d cell,that it is stronger than wondy so
11430,you have to have electricity flowing through it,he ogt to have a lectrisity flowing through it
11431,bye,i
11432,marney,morning
11433,well it's metal so it's creating electricity so the motor is running,well it's medale so it's courrading electrisity so the moter is running
11434,is that it's now metal so it's now running again,it's that it's medtal so it's now running again
11435,a closed circuit,a close circut
11436,the circuit is connected to the nail and the nail is metal so it is creating electricity from the d cell battery to the nail to the motor,the circet is connected to the nail and a nail um is meddal so it is creating electricity from the desa battery to the nail to the motor
11437,it is metal so is creating electricity so it's making the motor run,it is medale so is corating electrisity so it's making the motor run
11438,well the stick is not metal cause it is wood so the electric current is not running,well the stick is not meddale bcause it is wood so the lectric corent is not running
11439,it's open,its open
11440,the the aluminum nail the brass ring paper clip paper fastener and the steel mesh,the um the elomina nail the the brass ring paper clip paper fasner and the steel missh
11441,well the metal will conduct electricity but wood and plastic won't,um well the medal will condect electrisity but wood am im plastic wont
11442,because it's not metal so it's just it's not it's open so there's no electric flow,um because it's not meddal so it's just not it's open so there's no electrick flow
11443,good,good
11444,it runs when it's the metal or steel or copper,it runs when it's the medale or steel or coppe
11445,it has to have the electric flow from the negative side and there has to be two wires so it can go in and out,it have thatbe le to crow from the umneggutive side and they hase to be to wires so it can go in ten out
11446,it's the energy well it's the electricity going through the wires,it's the energy well it's seallectriscity going throghthe wires
11447,that either the negative and the negative sides are touching or the positive and the positive sides are touching,th do you ter the neggutive and the neggtive sides are touching or the pousitive an the pousitive sides are touching
11448,and like i said the light is gonna get brighter and brighter the more d cells you have,no like i set the light is going to get brihter and brighter the more deeseils you have
11449,so there well since the energy's going through the light bulb,um um so there um well since the energyis going through the lhight bolb
11450,that's going it's well that wait what did he say,that's going it's well that waight what dod you sa
11451,well that the blue dots are electricity and it's flowing through the light bulbs and then back to the d cell,well that the blue goughts area licke tristny and it's floing through the light bulbs and them back to the de so
11452,because the positive and the positive is right next to each other so the negative side will just go through the lights and then go back to the negative side it has to go back to the positive side,because the positive an thepositive is right next to each other so um the neggutive side wol just go through the lights and then go back to the neggutive side it has to go back to the positive side
11453,the wires is making a complete pathway so it is a complete circuit,we the wires is makng um a compleet path way um so it isn't a compleet circuet
11454,good,good
11455,well it goes through and so with the two wires it's making the bulb light up,well um it goes thoughl and um so with the two wires it's making the boll blide up
11456,bye,by
11457,a circuit is wait what,a circet is um wait what
11458,we've been getting d cell and been lighting one bulb and we've been laying two bulbs and seeing and see if they'll light together,we've been getting desel and been lighting one buld hale we'e ben laying two bulls and sn and see if they'll likhet blth toge
11459,from the negative side to the first light bulb and then back down and then to the other light bulb and then goes back down and goes back through the positive side of the d cell battery,from the neggotive side to the first light bullb and then back down and then to the other light bullb and then goes back down and gos back throgh the pousitive side of the deil battery
11460,that the light,that the lig
11461,that the lights are gonna get brighter because there's two batteries and and since there's two batteries it's making the two light bulbs really bright,that's the lights ar ging to get brighter because there's two badres and and since there's two bad res it's making the to light bulbs really bright
11462,well it it's making the flow and if it's if the both of the if the both of the bulbs are lighting up it's a complete circuit,well um i it's making the flow and if it's if the buls f the lo um if the bols of the bulabs are lying up it's a compleet circet

11594,it is filled to the top,it is filled to the top
11595,we have been measuring cans and we're seeing like how much the volume is so how much it her holds,we have being measuring cans and were sing like how much the volume is so harm shape her holds
11596,we've been using graduated cylinders to measure how much something is like the capacity of it,we've been using gradduated cilundures toure measure how much something is like the capassity of it
11597,i i see that the metal chip is more than the plastic chip,i s i see that the medtal chip is more than the plastic chip
11598,good,good
11599,i know that how one is more in one cup it means that one has more mass inside of it than the other,i know that how one is more in one cup it means that one has more mass inside of it than the other
11600,that if one is metal and one is plastic the metal one would probably be more weight,that if one is medtale in one is plastic the medtal one would probably be more wit
11601,bye i was i have to go right now so hopefully i can see you next time,by i'lls i'l have to go right now so hoply i can see you next time
11602,may you repeat that again,mayou repeat that again
11603,i have been doing balances where you weigh something,i have been doing balences where you way something
11604,what you could do is you could look at all em and then get a balance and then weigh which one is heavier than the other,what you could do is you could look at all of them and then get a balencet and then way which one is heavier than the other
11605,it would make it non accurate because one is bigger and one is smaller so you would have to use more smaller ones to add up the bigler one,it would make it none accurite because one is bigger and one is smaller so you would have to use more smaller ones to ad up to the big ore one
11606,accurate measurements is that it means accurate means like it's kinda right on track,accurit measure meants is that it means accurite means like it's kind of right on track
11607,wait tell me this are you getting anything you're saying,wait tell me this are you getting anything you're saying
11608,one big paper clip and one small paper clip,one big paper clip in one small paper clip
11609,okay,ok
11610,because um when like animals die they're they're just their bones so then they eat all of that to break the bones down,because um when like animals die they're jthe're just their bones so then they eat all a that to break the bones down
11611,it's because it's like the only food they eat cause just some people just are like kinda like a vegetarian so they just eat like you know,it's because it's like the only food they ecause just some people just aren't like kind of like a vegatarion so they just eat like you know
11612,i don't know how to speak but kinda like a vegetarian,i don't know how to spae but kind like a vegutarion
11613,i think they get their energy from when they eat bones and break them down,i think they get their energy from when they eat bones and break them down
11614,they ate all that paper and leave and when once they pooped it out it turned into soil,they ate all of that paper and leaves and t when once they poobed it out it turned into soil
11615,i don't know what the word is but i think it's another word to describe it is like vegetarian,i don't know what the word is b thing is up but to another where to describe is like vegitarion
11616,i think it just a consumer is all kind of all about eating to survive,i think it' just a consumer is all kind of all about eating to survive
11617,so we have a healthier planet,so we have  helphour planet
11618,i been learning about the food web producers um decomposer and consumers,i've been learning about the food wit producers um decomposers and consumers
11619,it's a decomposer,i de composur
11620,a bear what it means to me it is an omnivore,a beare mwhat it means to me it isn't on of or
11621,it eats like um snow white rabbits and that white count look like a hamster,it eats like um snow white rabbits and that white count look like a hamster
11622,i think it's kinda like a vegetarian for some people,i think it's kind of like a vegyu taring for some people
11623,makes them a decomposer,makes them a decomposur
11624,so they aren't all the same like some are vegetarian and some are meat eaters,oh they aren'tall the same like some are vegeatarions and some are meat eters
11625,it tells me not like us humans or carnivore or herbivores they don't eat that kind of stuff only decomposer eat that kind of stuff,it tells me not like us humons are carn ofvoor urbl voice they don't eat that kind ofstuff only d composeu see that kind of stuff
11626,a plant like grows it's own food through photosynthesis kinda like a cycle or ecosystem and it's kinda like an evolution,a plant like grows its own food through toto cemveces kind of like an sical or eo sistom and it's kindof like itiivolvesin
11627,it's kinda like when we recycle and throw away trash,it's kind of like when we er sicale and throw away trash
11628,i think it what it has to do is like um,i think it what it has to do is like um
11629,animals get their energy from the producers from like eating and drinking and kinda like energy from the sun like just like producers maybe,animals get their ennergy from the preducers from like eating and drinking an kind of like energy from the sund like just like producers maybe
11630,it's because they don't eat anything and they just make their own food so like the consumers could eat them,it's because they don't eat anything and they just make their own food so like the concumers can eat them
11631,they eat it all and then once they poop it out it turns into soil,they eat it all and then once they poop it out it turns into soil
11632,a carnivore is like the lion and the polar bear they only eat meat,a carn ofor is like the line in the pollbear they only eat meat
11633,i think they eat um eat grass which is on the right of the top front picture,i think the eaum eagrass which is on th right of the top front pitcher
11634,a worms are um they are a decomposer which they break down stuff like um those the d thing,a warms are um they are i decomposure which they break down stuff like on those dthing
11635,i think they eat kinda like trash and broken down bones and mostly and then they turn that into soil,i think they eacup like trash and broken down bones and mostly and then they turn that into soil
11636,that makes it a herbivore because it only eats meat,that makes it a hur revor because it only eats meat
11637,i think it breaks stuff down,i think it breaks stuff down
11638,it is an omnivore just like us humans it eats meat and plant,it is an on aogeus like us humis it eats met and plant
11639,a producer goes through it's photosynthesis it makes it's own food it doesn't eat anything,a producer gos through its poto cemfic it makes its own food it doesn't eat anything
11640,consumer is like what it eats and like what their enemies eat them,concumer is like whet it eats and like what their empneies eat them
11641,i think is what eats what,i think is what eats what
11642,they break down so it could turn into organic or soil,they break down soit can turn into organnic or soil
11643,like humans and bears they eat meat and plants,like humans and bears they eat meat and plants
11644,good,good
11645,i notice all the trash and leaves have been shortened that means it took it days or weeks or maybe years,i noticed all thet treash and leaves have been shore and that means it took in days or weeks or maybe years
11646,they eat like all kinds of trash and what they return is they return nutrients to the earth,they eat like all kinds of trash and what they return is they return ne new trans to the earth
11647,that means it's an omnivore,that means it's an onbr
11648,what is has to be it's kinda like um um killing others like this bear is eating a fish and probably the red tailed hawk eats like rabbits and birds,wouldit hav to be it's kind of like um um killing others like um like the bear is eating a fish ind probably the red tail hop eats like rabbits and bi
11649,there's herbivore omnivore carnivore and i don't know what the last one is,there's her before on the fore carvor and i don't know what the last one is
11650,i think what it means to be an omnivore like humans and black bears eat meat and plants,i think what means to be an onbor like humans and black bears eat meat and plants
11651,they break down decaying and decaying matter and they turn it into soil,they break down decan and decane matter and they turn it into soil
11652,that tells me it has to return something to the earth because they ate something that means that um they returned nutrients to the earth,that tells me it has to return something to theerth because they eate something that means that um they return new treans to the eart
11653,it is a consumer,it is a consumer
11654,this is all about what animals and fungi and bacteria eat,this is all about what animals ind fung guy ind bactarea eat
11655,means to be a carnivore is like lions and polar bears only eat meat that's what a carnivore is,ens to be a carnr is like lions and pullo bears only eat meat that's what a kin of war is
11656,good,good
11657,they go through their own photosyfesis to make their own food,they go through their own potoscimpances to make their own food
11658,what makes a plant a producer is because it makes it's own through photosynfesis um from sunshine and water,what makes a plant a producer is because it makes its own through fruit potal cenfances um from sunshine and water
11659,it only eats plants that means it's a herbivore,it only eats plants that means it's a heur before
11660,a producer makes it's own food and it gets sunshine and water to makes it's own photosynfesis and makes it's own food,a producer makes its own food and it gets sunshine and water to makes its own pot a cempences and makes  own foud
11661,and herbivore means like like elk or deer or bunnies only eat plant,an eaibor means like like ilk or deger or bunniys only eath plant
11662,the bear is an omnivore because it eats meat and plants,the bear isn't onoor because it eats meat and plants
11663,they get it from decaynah and decahnuh organ organic matter,they get it from dacana in dacana organorgannic matter
11664,get their energy from eating other they can't they can't eat themselves because and they can't make their own food so that's why they have to eat the other animals and they eat producers,l's get their energy from eating other they can't they can't eat themselves because and they can't make their own food so that's why they have toe other animals and they producees
11665,it's not a producer or a consumer it's a decomposer,it's not a producer or concumer its a decomposere
11666,they eat it all and then they turn it into soil that's why they are a decomposer,they eat it all and then they turn it into soil that's why they are a decomposur
11667,i think that producers are the grass and the pinecone,i think the producers are the grass in the pine cone
11668,what it's all about because it breaks down here or digging um all organists of matter,what it's all about because it breaks down here or diggng diccaria m all orgonis of matter
11669,no they are not,know they are not
11670,i think why it's so important is just because um they return nutrients and we nutrients in our body,i think why it's so important it's just because um they return new trains and we new trans in our body
11671,i think what's to be a consumer is um to um eat other things they're not they don't they can't make their own food they have to eat other things to get their energy,i think what's to be a consumer is um to um each other ther things t're not they don't they can't make their own food they have to eat other things to get their energy
11672,when they return nutrients to the world like we kinda return nutrients to the cause we need nutrients in our body,when they return new trs to the world like we kind of return new tranes to rlbcause we need new trns in our body
11673,i think what it means to be a decomposer that it means it eats it and then it um returns nutrients to the earth,i think whatt b means to be a de composure that it means it eats it and then it t um returns new trns to the earth
11674,because they break down bones and also they can turn it into something new like soil just like worms,because they breake down bones and also they cun turn it into something new like soil just like worms
11675,the decomposers are mushroom or fungi and bacteria,the de composers are mushroom or fung guy in bacterial
11676,i been learning about the food web also producers decomposers and consumers,i've been learning about the food web also producers de composers and concumers
11677,it's a decomposer it eats decaying and decaying matter and returns nutrients to the earth,it's a decomposer it eads decan and deccan matter and returns new trance to the earth
11678,i think what the lungs do is that um they give us oxygen and the main organ for breathing is in humans and so that's what i think about lung,i think what the lungs do is that um they give us oxygen and the main orgon for breathing is in humans and so that's what i think about lung
11679,they uh bring in oxygen with exchange of the carbon dioxide,a a bring in oxigen with exchange of the carm dy oxsid
11680,what the lungs do is that once we breathe in it gets kind of fatter and bigger and once we go out it gets smaller,what the lungs do is that once we breathe in it gets kind of fatter and bigger and once we breath out it goes smaller
11681,that um it's going through and through like i see like some circular things and it's going by from the heart and the capillary and others,that um it's going through and through like see like some circular things and it's going by the from the heart and the cat a pearly and others
11682,how they inhale and exhale is inhale is like once you breathe in from the nose which is the filter and then exhale is when you breathe out,how the in hailn ex hal is in hal is like once you breathe in from the nose which is the filter and then ex hails when you breathe out
11683,i think what it's all about is that it's showing how um where air goes in and carbon dioxide goes out in and out of your mouth or your nose,i think what it's all about is that it's showing how um where air goes in in car dos i goes out in an out of your mouth or your nose
11684,what the respiratory system does is like it helps you breathe like when it it goes in and out of your lungs when oxygen goes in and carbon dioxide goes out,what the respertoriou sistom does is like it helps you breathe like when it it goes in an out of your lungs when oxygen goes in in carm d oxide goes out
11685,i see little circles like it's getting passed through like a system like the carbon dioxide is going out and oxygen is going in,i see little circles like it's getting past throough like a sistom like the carb dioxi is going out an ox sid gens going in
11686,doing good,doing good
11687,they're responsible for i think when carbon oxygen goes in and they're responsible for carbon dioxide to go out,the're responsible for her i think when caroxygen goes in and the'e responsible for carm dy oxit to go out
11688,what the exchange of gases is all about is we survive with oxygen we can't survive with carbon dioxide cause that's kind of a poison oxygen to us,what the exchange of gesses all about is we sat survive with oxygen we can't survive with carbody oxi cause that's kind of poison oxygen to us
11689,first of all we need to survive second of all um it's our only way of life to breathe,first of all we need to survive secand aball um it's our only wa ofe livfe to breath
11690,that would probably be oxygen,that would probably be oxygen
11691,the gas exchange is from those alveoli and um that's where um where the oxygen goes in and the carbon dioxide goes out,a gasticchangement is from those avvuly and um that's where um where the um oxygen goes in in the carbindi oxide goes out
11692,i think it is e for lungs,i think it is eay for lungs
11693,i think their behavior is safety because they don't want to be eaten when they are flying high in the air,i think they'r behavieres safety because they don't want to bea eatther flang high in the ai
11694,i'm doing good,i'm doing goo
11695,this is a non learned behavior because they're hatching from their egg and they're they're already crawling out to sea,this is a nomilearn behavieur because theyr hatching from their eg and their ther already crawling out to s
11696,the stimulus is because the skunk or the coyote has an adaptation the skunk has a,the stimuluss is because um the scuger the coty um has a abectation tisn cs
11697,so i think why so it could swim and like it could like it could like push it in case if like one of it's ducklings like comes falling behind,so i think why so it could swim and like a c like it coul lik push it on in casiv like one of its ducklings like comes falling behind
11698,he would probably attack for it or just run away,he would probably attack for it or just run away
11699,that the rattlesnake is rattling it's tail to say go away from me or else i'll bite,that the ratdle snake is wraling it's hill to say go away from me ore also bite
11700,it's telling the person like once a snake's tail it rattles then it's about to attack the person,it's telling the person like ones  snakes um till it ratdles then it's about to attack the perso
11701,no,no
11702,like the reactions of people and animals,like the re actions of people and animals
11703,i think it's migrate behavior cause they're like not getting eaten,i think it's mi great behavieure cause ure like not getting eate
11704,that they wanted to protect themselves from other predators,that they wanted to protect themselves from other creddietors
11705,like the flippers help em kind of like feet to swim and also the beak for like to eat like fish or something for like its food or something,like um the flippers help tem kind like feed to swim and also the beak um for like um to eat like fish or something for like ets food or something
11706,it's a not learned behavior,it's a not learned behavior
11707,that it could shoot a bad smell out of its tail,s that it could shot a bet smell out of it's tail
11708,a cat is falling from a tree,a cat is falling from a tree
11709,it's pretty much marking its territory so predators can't eat it and also how one way they could defend themselves,it's um prety much marking it's um territory so um priters can't eat it and also how um one way they could defend themselv
11710,i think it's a learning behavior because you are learning how to write your name,i think it's a learning behaviure because you're learning how to right your name
11711,that he's telling the person to go away or else i'll bite you because he's trying to defend himself from predators like humans,that he's telling the person to go away or else i'll bite you because uhm he's trying to defend himself from creddetors like humans
11712,that the skunks tail is one of the adaptations because it shoots the smell out of it,jack the skuns tail is one of the aitations cause it shuts um the smell out of
11713,that they all have different reactions on different things,that they um all have different reactions on different things
11714,because usually animals are scared of bright colors or predators are scared of bright colors,cause usually um animals are scare o brite colors or creditors or scare to brite colors
11715,like it's kind of like the same color as the ground and also the turtle can actually hide in its shell and also it can come in so no predators can get it,like it's cnot like the same color as the crown and also the turtle can actually hide in its shell and also it can come and so pno preers can get it
11716,that means what the reaction part is i would probably just go away from it,that means um what the raction part is i would probably just go away from it
11717,i think it's a migration behavior because the black thing is stuck on the human's knee,i think it's af my graional behavieure because um  the black thing is stuck on the humans nee
11718,that like the dog wants to catch the frisbee and he is having fun and also the birds are flying together so they could be safe,that like the dog wants to catch the frs being he's having fun and also the birds are fng together so they couln be safe
11719,it's instinctive because it's reacting cause it's falling and he wants to land safely on the ground,it's instintive because it's re acting cause t's falling and he wants to lands safely on the groun
11720,i think it's kind of like like a migration behavior,i think it's kind of leg and like a mi gran behavieare
11721,i think number two the teeth because that's how it chews the meat,i think number two the teeth because um that's how it chose the meat
11722,i think it's the wings because it helps it fly away faster from the predator,i think it's the wings because um it helps it fly away faster um from the prei
11723,i think it's six because the houses the land the mountains the sky the trees and that little um blue grey brown thing,i think it's six because the houses the land the mountains the sky the trees in that little um blue grey brown thing
11724,i see the water i see the atmosphere which is the sky i see the mountains i see some trees and some houses,i see the water i see the atmosfer which is the sky i see the mountains i see some trees and some houses
11725,i think the biosphere is made out of um probably trees and humans and animals probably just trees plants and animals,i think the biols fer is made out um probably trees and humans and animals probably just treese plants and animals that's what i think
11726,the biosphere is probably all about life like trees plants and us like humans,the bie's fear is probably all about life like trees plants and us like humans
11727,good,
11728,i think they're just trying to survive not like to get eaten but probably the most dangerous ones are a snake a red tailed hawk,i think the'e just trying to survive not like to get eat end but probably the most dangerous ones are snake and a red tailed hawk
11729,well probably most animals go for probably bacteria mushrooms and um the others just go for like plants,oh probably most animals go for probly back tream mushroomsand um the others just go for like plants
11730,i think some yeah,i think some yeah
11731,it's kinda mostly in the same thing but it's mostly in the winter or like antarctica or like where mount everest is,it's kind of mostly and the same thing but it's mostly in the winter or like umndar to go or like wr mount everes
11732,i think it represents the climate or weather or like the temperature,i think it reppresents the climmate or weather or like the temperature
11733,what it needs is to survive is probably soil water air and sunshine,what it needs is to survive is probably soil water air in sunsh
11734,they don't get their own food they make their own food cause they're a producer and it makes it's own food through photosynthesis,they don't get their own food they make their own food cause theyre a producer and it makes its own food through potoimtences
11735,they make it through their own photosynthesis,they make it through their own photos scempaces
11736,it kind of looks green but it it has sunshine and air but no water so that's why it's kind of like bending,it kind of looks green but um it it has sunshine o air but no water so that's why it's kind of like bending
11737,i think all those cells like combine to make one whole like tiny grain of sand of yeast,i think all these selves like combined to make one hole lake ctiny grain of sand a ea
11738,it's like what eats what and what eats them,it's like what eats what ind what eats the
11739,when water sunshine and air and like all those combine together the roots go down into the dirt and then when which comes out is like a plant,when water sunshine ind air re like all those combine together the roots go down into the dirt and then when um which comes out is like a pla
11740,it's kind of like when you get like a sunburn like a human and it's getting all yellow cause it has no sun and it's not getting any green,it's kind of like when you get like a sunburn like a human and it's getting all yellow because it has no sun and is not getting any green
11741,doing good,doing go
11742,they do not because because when it rains in the spring it gets water and then sunshine and then it gets air when it blows,they do not because um uhm because when it rains in the spring it gets water and then sunshine and then it gets air when it blows
11743,i think plants i read a book about this and it probably needs carbon dioxide which is kind of it's air,i think plants i read a book about this and it probly needs carm dayoci wich is kind of its a
11744,actually no because when i did my experiment in the bag we didn't use any water and it's and it's still growing on its own,actually know because um when i did my experiment um in the bag we didn't use any water and it's in it's still growing on its own
11745,yes they do need it,best they do need it
11746,yes it does,yes it does
11747,it's because they were all sickly and not healthy,it's because they werel sickly and not healtthy
11748,it wouldn't be a problem because like i just said it goes through it's own photosynthesis which it makes it's own food it can't eat anything,it wouldn't be a problem because um like at just said i'll it gos through its own pota simpiiss which it makes its own food they can't eat anyth
11749,when we put the plants in the bag it had like a ton of air or carbon dioxide in it and that's why it needs to survive,when we put the plants in the bag um it had like a ton of airrcarmb in dioside in it and that's why it needs to survive
11750,it has two out of three but not three out of three because they it needs water air and sunshine it can not be water air and no sunshine,it has towo out of three but not three out of three because um  it needs water air and sunshine it cannot be water air and no sunsh
11751,i think it's trying to make some kind of signal or something,i think it's trying to make some kind of signal or something
11752,because it can't breathe any carbon dioxide and it's not breathing out any oxygen,because um it can't breathe any carbindioside and it's not breathing out any oxygen
11753,i think it's kind of like plants like they need sunshine air and water,i think it's kind like plants like the need sunshine air in water
11754,yes it would be missing three things sun water and air,yuess it would be missing three things sun water an air
11755,how it relates to me is like it goes through it's own photosynthesis it needs sunshine water and air for it to grow,how it relates to me is like um it goes through its oto bone oatof camtences ant needs sunshine water an air for it to grow
11756,where food webs start will probably be at the producers because probably most consumers eat those producers,where food wep start will probably be at the producers because probably most concumers eat those producers
11757,they just stay in one place they don't move besides they make their own food through photosynthesis with the sun carbon dioxide and water,iyus stay in wone place they don't move besides  they make their one food through photo cefences with um the sun come carbit di oide and w
11758,think what it's trying to show is that sunshine reflects off the plant so it can,i think what is trying to show is that sunshine reflecs off the plan so i can
11759,because grass and the pine cone on the tree are producers and the plants are producers they make their own food which the consumers eat,because um grass i in the pine cone on the tree are producers and the plants are producers they make their own food which um the concumers eat
11760,yes they do need it because it's kind of like what they need to breathe,yust they do needent because it's kind like what they need to brea
11761,what i just really think is just what eats what eats the producers consumers and the decomposers,what i just really think is just what eats wht and what eat the producers concumers and the decomposers
11762,it's because it doesn't have any water,it's because it  doesn't have anywater
11763,i think light when it reflects so it helps it grow i think the water when you pour it so it stays healthy and the carbon dioxide which it breathes in and oxygen it breathes,i think light when it reflecs so it healps it grow i think the water um when you poor it so it stays healthmy and the cor bindihocs it which it breazes in an oxygen it breathe
11764,i think they do because some animals eat them and that will protect them from animals,i think they do because i'm some animals eat them and that will protect them from animals
11765,i think why is because there's no wind and there's just sunshine and water but it has to be complete with water air and sunshine for it to grow,i think wy its because um there's no wind and there's just sunshine in water but it has to be compleet with water air and sunshine for it to grow
11766,it has water sunshine but no air,it has water sunshine but no a
11767,the sun,the sun
11768,no they do not need food because they they have they have their own photosynthesis which they make their own food,know they do not need food because um they they have they have their own fota subtances which they make their own foo
11769,like some people say so it doesn't damage it,like some people say um so it doesn't damag
11770,sometimes when consumers are eating them they'll have to put fertilizer around it so the animals can't eat cause if they eat it it'll kind of be like a gross taste,sometimes when concumers are getting them the'll have to put vurtallizser around it so the animals can't eat it cause if they eat it can't be like a gros tast
11771,it shows like a like a like a some kind of of drink that makes it grow food,it shows like a like a like a some kind of o drink that makes it grow flu
11772,it's because they do their own photosynthesis which they make their own food,it's because they do their own ponants ind ite swish they make their own food
11773,it has all three things water air and sunshine,that has all three things water aire and sunsh
11774,i think anything else to point out to me is like when the yeast kind of like rises from the bread except it gets it puffy for the air or carbon dioxide that flows in the bag,i think um anything else to point out to meis like when the yost kind of like rises from a bread except it gets at puffy for the car like aior carmdi out side that flows in the b
11775,yes it can because if it doesn't have any sunshine it will turn like first day it will turn tan then it will turn yellow not green,yes it can be cause um if it doesn't have any sunshine it will turn like um first day it will turn tan that it will turn yellow not gre
11776,it's all healthy and because it has all three things water air and sunshine,it's all healthy and new tre because it hase all three things water air and sunshi
11777,what i observe is like little tiny particles inside the yeast when it's like kind of like mixed with the water,what i observe is like little tity particles inside the east when it's like h like mixed with the water
11778,it's a house,it's a hous
11779,what's important about producers is because they make their own food and once a consumer comes because they can't make their own food they have to eat something that's why they eat the producers,what's importnt about producers is because um they make their own food and then wants a consumer comes because um they can't make their own food they have to eat something that's why the the producers
11780,that means it's a all and healthy plant,that means it's a all new trated and healthy plan
11781,it's because they need light energy carbon dioxide and water so all those things so it can produce it's own food without those three things it can not grow,it's because they need light and ergy come di outside and water so all those trinks so um it can produce its own food without those three things it cannot grow
11782,there is one of like parallel there is that is palmate and there's one that is parallel,there is one of like parrelell there is one that is pallma and there's one that is parelell
11783,some examples are simple leaf parallel leaf and palmate leaf,some examples are simplif parlleaf and pall ma leaf
11784,i think the veins are for like they also use like the blood which it pumps in kind of like the human body's veins,i think the vains are fur like um they also use like the bud u which it pumps inkind like the human bodysvains
11785,i've been learning about veins from leaves and from sap from trees and also some other stuff from science,i've been learning about vains from leaves and from sap from trees and also some other stuff from science
11786,one is called simple another is palmate and the third one is parallel,one is called simple another is paullmay and the third one is parrelel
11787,i think it comes from the air cause kind of like from the clouds it gives like water out once it rains so i think that's why,i think it comes from the air cuse kindof like from the clouds it gives like water out ence it rains so i think that's wy
11788,it is the pattern of their veins and also the outside shape which it was born with,it is the pattern of their vaines and also the outside shape which it was born with
11789,that tells me that it is a simple leaf,that tells me that it is a simple leaf
11790,i think it's a simple leaf because it's kind of like half and half and it's all parallel and it's kind of like the same on half,i think it's a simpllif because um it's kind of like half ind half and it's all parrellell and it's kind like the same on half
11791,i think it is a simple leaf because it's veins are going kind of like a circular outside direction,i think it is a simply because its vains are going klike a circulor outside direction
11792,how it gets it's nutrients and that's getting out of it kind of like the carbon dioxide it's breathe i meant sorry the oxygen it's breathing out,how u gets it's  new treats and the xiliams that's getting out of bit cinna like the cum carbindioxcide it's breate i ment sorry the oxygen it's breething out
11793,i think it was somebody that put a guy a bag and poured water in it or maybe it was just rain,i think it was somebody that um um put a got a bag and pored water in it or maybe it was just rain
11794,it is the air and water i see like particles of air and particles of water,it is the airn water i see like particles of air and particles of water
11795,like the phloem is like going down in the plant like it's nutrients and probably that kind of like the oxygen that's coming out of it,like the polem is like going down in the plant like it's new trens and probably eklan that um like kind of like the oxgen that's coming out of it
11796,i am doing good today,i am not doing good today
11797,that it has like different things like like the nutrients go inside and then something else goes outside of it,that it has like different things like um like the new trans go in side and then something else gots outside of it
11798,the esophagus it does that pushes all the food down into the stomach,the softist gess it does um that it pushes all the food down into the stummic
11799,mouth the mouth usually just chews it and swallows it,mouth the mouth usually just chuse it and um um swollows it
11800,oh it it pushes down all the chewed up food like it like those little bits so it could like fit through that kind of like little tube of the esophagus,oh it it um pushes down all the chu up food um like it like those little bits so it  like um fit through that k like little tobe of thes soppa giss
11801,i see,i s
11802,just to usually just to break down the food and once you're hungry you eat some so it won't go kind of like hungry for a little bit,just y usually just um break down the food and once you're hungry you eat some so it won't go um n like hungry for a little bit
11803,i think what's for the muscle cells is like they help your muscles grow or something or i think they'll help you move it,i think what's for the muscle selles is like um the help you're muscles like grower something or i think thei'll help you move it
11804,they are probably made out of meat,they are probably made out of meats
11805,like in a digestive system it has to have like some kind of cells cause maybe like the saliva that's been in your mouth once you eat it maybe those cells kind of like break it down,like in ta digusticcistom it has to have like some k of sells cause maybe like the saliva that spend your mouth wonce you eat it maybe those selles kindo like break it down
11806,think the leaf has like a ton of,ik beliefe  has like a ton
11807,there are like all sorts of cells and maybe they carry the nutrients for the arm so the skin's healthy,they are like all sorts of sels and maybe they carry the new tre ins for the armso the skins healthy
11808,doing good,doing good
11809,they usually just break down the food which you eat when you're hungry,a usly just break down the food which you eat when you're hungry
11810,i think what they are is like some kind of like nutrients that help the skin like stay like healthy and stays smooth,i think what they are is like um some kind of like new treens that healp te skin like stay like healthy aunt stays mooth
11811,it's trying to show me those brain cells,it's trying to show me those bra brain selles
11812,what the mouth does is once you chew it goes down into your body into the stomach,what the mouth does is when once you chuw it goes down into your body into the stumic
11813,what i notice about it is a human body and i think it's pointing to certain things where the cells are for most important stuff,what i noticed about is a human body and i think it's pointing um to certin things where theselves are for most important stuff
11814,i think the butterfly has cells because it needs some kind if thing like it like sucks up pollen,i think the buterfly hesles because um it needs some kind of thing like it like soox a pollen
11815,what it tells me is like there's like huge cells and like there's less cells in a leaf because their all all the cells are in one section,what it tells me is like there's like huge sells and why there's less sellvs in a leaf because er all all thesellves are in one sexsi
11816,i see all sorts of cells and i see some veins plus i see the skin,i see all sortsof sells and i see some fings plus um i see the skin
11817,it usually just usually just pushes it down into the stomach that's probably which i all know,it usually just usually just pushes it down into the stubbict that's probably which i all know
11818,they are they are all sorts of cells,they a they are all sorts of selvs
11819,they both drink,they both drink
11820,like it's kind of like all in the digestive system like all over your body like somehow it could like breaks it down or has a certain job to do for the whole body,like it's kind of like all in the dijustifs sistom like all over your body like some how it like breakes it down or has a curten job to do for the whole body
11821,i notice that what this is similar to them that they have cells,i notice that um what this is simeler to them that they have selves
11822,i think what it's trying to show us is like once you eat it where it goes through and how like the steps where it goes through to break down all the food and then you pee it out,i think what i's trying to show us is like w um when you eat it where it goes through and how like the steps wheret goes through to break down all the food and then you peak it out
11823,i see like shapes kind of like a and maybe there will be all sorts of cells kind of like a to tell like messages to the body,i see like shapes kindo like of sparks and maybe there'll be all sorts of selves kind of like af movement to tell like messages to the bbody
11824,i think what the muscle cells are like they help your muscles move,i think what the mul selles are like they help your muscles move
11825,i think they are because they both have blood inside of each other,i think they are because they both have blod inside of each other
11826,i think this was trying to show is kind of like the yeast is kind of like the skin of a human body,i think it's was trying to show is k like the yeast is k like the skin of a human body
11827,but i also know is just travels all along with those cells like with the food how like side by side or like in a line or something,but i also know is just travels all along with themselves like with tha food w ekeside by side or like in a lin or something
11828,that it has all cells because it's a living organism,that it has all selves because it's a living orgonisom
11829,i think what those brain cells like they like send messages to the body like like tell the hand to move,i think what those brains sows like theum like se messages to the body like um like til the hand to move
11830,it's the gastric juice in the acid,it's se gastic guce in the asid
11831,the skin cells are for like your skin so they stay healthy,the skin sells are for like your skins so they stay healthy
11832,i think they're both different cells because they're not working for like like yeast cells are not working for human cells,ithey're both different selves because um they're not um working for like um like um ges shelles are not working for humanselves
11833,i've been learning about the digestive system and also i've been learning about like how it works through your body,i've been learning about the dijustif sistom and also i've ben learning about like um how it works um through your body
11834,it was important because they have to be good in have to put in good and if if they're not well done they can break,it is important because tey have to be goodin thy have to put in good and if if they're not well dom they can break
11835,i think what i would like to test is seeing seeing how far it goes and seeing the li the block can go be heavier,i think what i would like to test as seing seing how far it goes ind seing the litte the block cand go beheavier
11836,i think it's,thank you to maddy
11837,we have seen a flipper system,we have to seenu op for sistom
11838,good bye,goodbye
11839,you need a something to make it flip you need you need a stick and to measure it,you ned u something to make it flip you need you need a stick and to measure it
11840,i think you would just by um for example you can say the brook holds the stick in and it makes it and you measure it and it makes it go in,i think you would juscribe it by um for example you can say the brok colds the sticken and it makes it in you measure in it makes it gon
11841,it makes it a system because the propeller's spinning around,it makes it a sistome because the prepellar  spinning around
11842,i think we haven't,i think we haven't
11843,we have been learning about flippers and we have been yeah we have been learning about flippers,e haver learning about flippers and we have a band ye have o hav en learng about fier
11844,i think what you can change you can,du a heavr b block to see if it gos farther
11845,i think what that is all about is measuring it and seeing how far it goes,i think what that is all about is measuringe and seing how far it gos
11846,i think what's going on there it makes a good flipper system because it bounces off and it holds it tight and you don't want to bounce it off that high because the the stick can break,i think whit's going on there in makes ig soper sistom because it bouns it sof and it holds it tight and you don't want a bounts it alf that high because it bit sick can break
11847,i'm very good,am very good
11848,you can also um do a smaller stick and see yeah you can do that too,you can also umdo a smaller stick and to see at you can do that too
11849,when you click it it bounces off,when you click it it bounse is sof
11850,these are all about measuring how far the brook goes and seeing if it goes that far,these objects are all about masuring how far the brockgos and seing if it gos that far
11851,i found out that you get you're measuring it and that you're seeing how far the brook goes and if it doesn't go that far you put the capacity you write the capacity and you,i found out that you get you' measuring it and tiy you'e seing how far the brokos and if it doesn't go that far yu put the copasity you read the copascity and you
11852,um you can flip,you can do this experiment you can d
11853,um you can think of,um you can think out
11854,i think what the base is all about is measuring it and like seeing if it goes far,i think what the bacis all about is measuring it and like seing if it gos far
11855,i think what is up with that object would be um seeing how far it goes maybe,o i think what is up with that object would be um seing how far it gos maybe
11856,um you can the block that holds the stick it can be smaller or it can be heavier,um you can the block that holds the stick it can be smaller or it can be heavier
11857,there is something on the on top of it and that you hold it you put it under the block and you just flip it and you see how far it goes,there is something on the nttop of it and the you hold it you put it under the block and youd just lip it and you see how fiyr it gos
11858,it connects it by putting the stick on the bottom of the brick and if it goes far you just push it in you just take it out and it's and then just put it,it connecs it by putting the stick on the bottom of the brick and if itgls far you jus push itin't youd just take it out and it's and then just put it
11859,spinning the rubberband around and seeing how how far it goes,i think it is all abount
11860,systems are all about measuring and doing seeing seeing what how the system looks,sistoms are all about measuring and d saying sing w how the sistom looks
11861,what's going on with that is that we have to learn about pendulums we have to learn how to p how to do science and and to learn more things,'s going on with that is that we have to learn about pendallums en e have to learn how to pu how to do sciens and and to learn more things
11862,no some of them hold ten or nine,no some of them hold ten or nine
11863,very well,s very well
11864,you can build them out of lifeboats you can build them out of wood,you can build them ut of liesboalts you can bull them ut of wood
11865,learn about o,an about o
11866,i i think i'm not sure i think you have to measure thirty centimeters on them and we learned how to how many pendulums that it can hold and how much water it can hold,i i think i'm not sure i think you have the measured thirty senimmetos on them and we learn how n how many pendallums that it can hold and how much water it can hold
11867,about eleven and c could have ten and the shortest one could have eight,about eleven and sle could have ten in the shurtest one could have eight
11868,i think it could connect to the capacity of the boat would be we can just measure measure em and it can be eighty millimeters or sixty two millimeters thirty eight fifty five millimeters,i think it c cannecd to the capassit of the boat would be wc can just mesure mesure im and it can be alimiters or sixty two miliiter thirty eight fifty five millioneters
11869,bye,by
11870,i've built mine out of pa out of paper cups,i built mine out of pate out of paper cop
11871,first you have to measure a the boat and see and put it in the water and you i think you measure thirty centimeters on them and then you'd need to,first you have to measure up the boat and see and put it in the water and you i think you measure thirty sens and metors on them and then you need to
11872,why i think they got a different number of pennies is because they cutted them shorter or longer,why i think they got in se front number of pentices because they caught at them shorter or longer
11873,i would think about putting pennies in it or water,i would think about putting pennies in it or water
11874,i discovered that the boat can fit twelve twelve pendulums in the little boat,i discovered that the boat can f twelve twelve pendalums anin the little boat
11875,when i when i noticed that a wasn't drowning that much i started putting more and more uh pendulums in em and when i drowned it i i got my answer really easily,when i when i noticed that i wasn't drowning that much i started parting more and moral pendalums in him and when it drounded i i got my answer really easily
11876,we have been learning about boats and we have been putting pendulums in the boats and seeing how many pendulums can fit inside the little boat,we have been learning about boats and we have ben putting pendalums in the boats and seing how many pendallems can fte inside the little boat
11877,we,we
11878,the lifeboats are all about you go you can go on a romantic date you can,um go to the river and get on then you can have a pignic in them
11879,what is going on there is the propeller is the string is making it balance it and it keeps going around and around propeller keeps going around and around,whet is going on there is the ppollar athe string is micking at ballencey and it keeps going around and around te people that keeps going around and around
11880,i think it will because it has to have more power on it and it has to go up farther and i think that would affect it,i think it will because it has to have more power on it and it has to go up farther and i think that would effect thit
11881,so it has also been nice talking to you marty,s all it has also been nice hocking to you marty
11882,what we've been doing in science we were we have been doing airplanes we have been seeing is the airplane propeller can fly,wahha've e've ben doing in cience ewere have been doing airplans nd we have been seing if the airplane perpeller can fly
11883,thank you,pinki
11884,thank you,thank you
11885,i think when setting up your my experiment was it was tricky to put it together but it worked really well and,i think whene setting up there at my experiment was it was trick ton put it together but i worked really well and
11886,it's going very well marty,'s going very well mardy
11887,you can also change the propeller you can use fishing you can use fishing wire and you can make the propeller smaller you can make the the,yeah
11888,you,do
11889,okay so how many spins it takes spins are forty five spins it made and the distance is how much meter how much meters you measure it,okaso how many spinds it takes spiens are't forty five spends it made in the distance is how much meeter how much meeters you measure it
11890,so what the parts of the plane i use the propeller is making it spin and the string the straw and the string is making it balance it,so what the parts of the plane are used the propellar is making a spin and the string the straw in the tring is making a bealence
11891,i think the kinds of things that are important what makes if fly is the propeller makes it fly and that the string is balanced and a and that the straw is great is put good on it,i think the kinds of things that are important well makes it fly is a pepelar mak it fly and that the string is balence and a and that the straw is great is pugood oni
11892,i think what that is all about it makes the propeller spin and if we don't have the rubber band in the bottom it's not going to work,i think what that is all about at makes the prepeller spin and if you don't have thever run n th water mits like n work
11893,you have to the propeller is all about making the propeller spin,you have to  the propeller i's all about making the prepeller spin
11894,when it spins the thing on the bottom spins around too with it and m and then you measure how much far it went,when itspins the thing on the bottom itspins around to with it and and and then you measure how much far it wons
11895,i think the number of swings isn't right because you ha also the string has to be balanced and the propeller has to be moving,i think the numberof swings is  right because you ha also the string has to be beallence and the porpeller has to be moving
11896,with string,string
11897,thank you,think
11898,marnie,forty
11899,i think what is important about the flying line is because and it attaches to it and it makes it balance and if e you don't have it on the bottom it's gonna not go that fast,i think what is importan't about tha flyiing line it's because im it attatches to it and then makes it ballence and i youldon't have it on the bottom it's gunnot go that fast
11900,okay,k
11901,what you can also do when the parts are all working together is you can put the string into the straw and then you can just swing it across and it balance it and if it doesn't balance it's going to wiggle a lot,whet you can also do when the pars are ll wrking together its you can put the string into the straw and then you can just sing it across and it ballence it and if e doesn't ballences get a wiggo lo
11902,okay,k
11903,i think that if the string isn't balanced that well it's not gonna work it's not gonna spin it's it's it's just not gonna work,i think that if the string is in ballenced tha well it's not gono work it's not anouh spin it's it's just no gon  work
11904,yeah that's it,the pepeller on it and then you need to just stippl the twoother other um
11905,i am very well how are you marnie,i am wire well how are you mardy
11906,i think the other things that are important when you are flying your plane is that it's really balanced and it's not wiggling a lot and that your propeller spins,i think other things that are importanwhen you're pying your pling is that it's really ballence and it's not whenwiggling a lawt and that your prepeller spits
11907,i think the propellers are all about i am guessing that the propellers are to keep it balanced,i think the pepellears are all about i am guessing that the pepellers are to keep it ballence
11908,me too,me to
11909,um well maybe it's you have to put the airplane hanging attached to a string and you have to see how if it can fly,umwell maybe it's you have to put the airplane hanging attached to a string and you have to see how iffi can fly
11910,bye it's been nice talking to you too,buy it's beend nice talking to you too
11911,i think how i might affect it is because the second one isn't really well done and if it goes up it's gonna go back down and the first one is gonna keep going straight,i think how i might effect it is because the second one isn't really well don and if it gols up it's goin to go back down and the first wine is gong to kep going straigh
11912,i think it's balancing it and it's making the airplane fly,i think it's baloencing i and it's making the airplain fly
11913,thank you,k
11914,the string was all about seeing how fast the airplane could h fly and the string,the string was all about seing how fast the airplant could ha fly and the strng
11915,i think what that was all about was,i think w that was all about was
11916,it can stay a magnet as um for a bit longer than it can stick to the magnet but it loses its magnetism,it can say and magnet a um for a bit longer than it an stick to the magnet but it looses its magnetisum
11917,the magnet rubbing the nail will give some magnetism to the nail so it can pick up the paper clip,the magnet rubbing the nail give some magnetizom to the nail so it can pick up the paper clip
11918,they can go through thin objects and also they can connect to each other when they're off but the magnetism is so strong between the two magnets that it can pull through the table,they can go through thin objects and also they can connect to each other when they're off but the magnetisom is so strong between the two magnets that it can pull through the table
11919,this magnet that we're showing here has been connected cause the paper is very thin,this magnet that were showing here has been conected because the paper is very thin
11920,the magnet ca is lifting up the nail that is sending electrons to the to the paper clip,the magnet kit is lifting up the nail that is cending lectrtm to the favorite glif
11921,if you do not have the strongest magnetism in your magnet it cannot get through thicker things,if you do not have the strongest magnatisom and your magnet it cannot get through ficker things
11922,nail picked up the nail picked up the paper clip but then it lost its magnetism and then and then the magnet came back to give it more magnetism and it could pick up the paper clip again,a naile picked up the nail picked up the paper clip but then it lost its magnettisom and then and then the magnet came back to give it more magnet to them and it could pick up the paper clip again
11923,a nail has some magnetism in it to pick up the um the paper clip,a nail has some magneattiz a minute to pick up the um the paper clib
11924,the nail can only s um stay like a magnet so long because cause it does not it cannot keep as a magnet can the magnetism that stays in it forever,the nail can only sum stay like a magnet so long because cause it does not it cannot keep as a magnet can the magnetisom that stays in it forever
11925,the nail is using magnetism to um keep the paper clip on it but the paper clip can only stay on so long cause the magnetism um wears off after a while,the nail is using magnatisom to um keep the paper clip on it but the paper clip can only stay ond so long cas the magnatisom um wears off after a while
11926,well magnets can stick to each other because they both have iron and they can attract because they're on different sides,well magnets can stick to each other because they both have irn and they can attract because they'are in different sides
11927,the nail cannot always be a magnet and the magnet is always a magnet,the nail can not always be a magnet and th magnet is always magnet
11928,the nail is not a magnet so it can't pick up the paper clip when it's not connected to the magnet,the nail is not a magnet so it can't pick up the paper clip when it's not connected to the magnet
11929,magnetism is when um the magnet can stick to things with iron in them,natisome as when um the magnet can stick to things wifh irn in them
11930,it is picking up something with iron it just like the the magnet is doing to the nail,it is picking up something with iron it just like tht the magnet is doing to the nail
11931,the nail is acting just like it can be in its own magnet because it is using the magnet's force,the nail is acting just like it can be in its own magnet because it is using the magnets force
11932,we've been learning about magnets,we've been learning about magnets
11933,i have put it through paper it has gone through some thin tables and also it sticks to all iron,i have put it through paper it has gone through some thin tables and also it sticks to all irn
11934,magnets going through things can only go through certain things cause they're not as thick as other things,magnets going through things can only go through certan things cause the'renot as thick as other things
11935,the paper clip can stay on the um on the nail for many times and falls when the magnet has no more magnetism in it in it,the paper clip can stay on the um om the nail for many times and falls when the magnet has no more magnettisin t in it
11936,the magnets both have iron in them and they're on the r the different sides so they are still attracting,the magnets  both have irn and them and they're on the r the different sides so they are still attracting
11937,the magnets on the same time and the table thi is not that thin i mean it's not that thick so it mus they must have been pulling each other because magnetism,a magnets on ours on the same time and the table  is not that thin i mean it's not that sthick so it mu they must have been pulling each other because e magnetisom
11938,the paper clip is dropping off the nail because the magnetin magnetis magnetism because of many things,the paper clipp is dropping up the nail because the magnetin magnetz magnetisome because of many things
11939,bye,bye
11940,i know that magnets stick to iron,i know that magnets stick to irn
11941,if you rub the magnet on the nail it'll collect enough force so that it can pick up the paper clip,if you rub the magnet on the nail it'll clec enough force so that it can pick up the paper clip
11942,if the magnet touches the nail then then it can come up and create its own magnetism,if the magnet toutches the nail then then it can come up and create it's own magnatisom
11943,magnet doesn't have enough force pick up the paper clip so the paper clip fell on the floor instead of going through like the thin piece of paper and connecting to the magnet,magnet doesn't have enough force to pick up the paper clips so the paper clip fell on the floor instead of going through like the thin piece of paper and conecting to the magnet
