2483,IF YOU HAVE A MAGNET RIGHT HERE ON THIS PIECE ON THE BIG PIECE OF PAPER AND A MAGNET RIGHT HERE ON THE THIN PIECE OF PAPER AND A PENCIL RIGHT HERE IT WON'T BE STRONG ENOUGH TO PULL TOWARDS THIS WITH A PENCIL BEHIND IT,IF YOU HAVE A MAGNET RIGHT HERE ON THIS PIECE ON THE BIG PIECE OF PAPER AND A MAGNET RIGHT HERE ON THE THIN PIECE OF PAPER AND A PENCIL RIGHT HERE IT WON'T BE STRONG ENOUGH TO PULL TOWARDS THIS WITH THE PENCIL BEHIND IT
2484,THE FORCE OKAY,THE FORCE OKAY
2485,WELL THE NAIL HAS A MAGNETA FIELD AROUND IT SO IF YOU PUT THE MAGNET ON IT AND PUSH IT DOWN IT'S LIKE THE MAGNET WILL STICK TO THE PAPER CLIP ALWAYS,WELL THE NAIL HAS A MAGNETIC FIELD AROUND IT SO IF YOU PUT THE MAGNET ON IT AND PUSH IT DOWN IT'S LIKE THE MAGNET WILL STICK TO THE PAPER CLIP ALWAYS
2486,IT'S BASICALLY JUST IT'S BASICALLY THE PAPER CLIP IS ALWAYS GONNA BE MAGNETIZED RATHER WHAT YOU DO IT'S GOING TO BE MAGNETIZED BUT IF YOU HAVE SOMETHING TOO THICK THE MAGNET WON'T STICK TO THE PAPER CLIP,IT'S BASICALLY JUST IT'S BASICALLY THE PAPER CLIP IS ALWAYS GONNA BE MAGNETIZED RATHER WHAT YOU DO IT'S GONNA BE MAGNETIZED BUT IF YOU HAVE SOMETHING TOO THICK THE MAGNET WILL STICK TO THE PAPER CLIP
2487,THE NAIL ISN'T FORCING THE PAPER CLIP UP TO IT BECAUSE THE MAGNET'S OFF IT AND ALSO THE FORCE IS OFF IT SO THE MAGNET STILL HAS A FORCE AND ABSERBED IT LIKE IT UP,THE NAIL ISN'T FORCEEING THE PAPER CLIP UP TO IT BECAUSE THE MAGNETS OFF IT AND ALSO THE FORCE IS OFF IT SO THE MAGNET STILL HAS THE FORCE AND OBSERVED IT LIKE SWELLED IT UP
2488,WELL MOSTLY I'VE BEEN LIKE JUST TRYING TO DISCOVER WHAT ELSE IS MAGNETS BY RUBBING A MAGNET ON SOMETHING THAT'S NOT MAGNETIZED AND IT WORKED,WELL MOSTLY I FEEN LIKE JUST TRYING TO DISCOVER WHAT ELSE IS MAGNETS BY RUBBING A MAGNET ON SOMETHING THAT'S NOT MAGNETIZED AND IT WORKED
2489,BECAUSE OF THE FORCE IS FORCING IT TO STICK TOGETHER,BECAUSE OF THE FORCE IS FORCING IT TO STICK TOGETHER
2490,OKAY SO IT'S THE GRAVITY IT'S CALLED A FORCE AND IF IT DOESN'T STICK THAT'S FORCING IT AWAY FROM IT,OKAY SO IT'S I THE GRAVITY IT'S CALLED TA FORCE AND IF IT DOESN'T STICK THAT'S FORCING IT AWAY FROM IT
2491,THE NAIL WON'T PICK UP THE PAPER CLIP BECAUSE IT'S NOT MAGNETIZED YET,THE NAIL WON'T PICK UP THE PAPER CLIP BECAUSE IT'S NOT MAGNETIZED YET
2492,THE NAIL ISN'T PICKING UP THE PAPER CLIP BECAUSE THE FORCE IS ALWAYS IN THE MAGNET,THE NAIL ISN'T PICKING UP THE PAPER CLIP BECAUSE THE FORCE IS ALWAYS IN THE MAGNET
2493,NETISM BASICALLY IS VERY VERY IMPORTANT,NETISOM BASICALLY IS VERY VERY IMPORTANT
2494,CAUSE THE NAIL IS GETTING THE MAGNETIC FORCE FROM THE MAGNET SO FOR INSTANCE IF YOU KEPT DOING IT IT WILL MAKE THE PAPER CLIP STICK,CAUSE THE NAIL IS GETNING THE MAGNETIC FORCE FROM THE MAGNET SO FOR INSTANCE IF YOU KEPT DOING IT IT WILL MAKE THE PAPER CLIP STICK
2495,IT'S CALLED A SHOW FLOW,IT' CALLED A SHO FLOW
2496,EVERYTHING WILL DROP BECAUSE MOST OF THE RINGS ARE GETTING STUCK FROM THE MAGNET,EVERYTHING WILL DROP BECAUSE MOST OF THE RINGS ARE GETTING STUCK FROM THE MAGNET

2498,OKAY OKAY CAN WE JUST MOVE ONTO ANOTHER THING,OKAY OKAY CAUN WE JUST MOVE ONTO ANOTHER THING
2499,BECAUSE ALL THE ENERGY FLOWS AROUND AND AROUND AND AROUND AND AROUND THE RIVET AND GOES BACK INTO THE BATTERY AND DOES IT AGAIN,BECAUSE ALL THE ENERGY FLOWS AMOUNTING AROUND AN AROUND AROUND THE RIVET AND GOES BACK TOGH THE BATTERY AND DOES IT AGAIN
2500,CAUSE IF THE SWITCH IS CLOSED THAT MEANS THE CIRCUIT WORKS CAUSE IT'S AN ELECTROMAGNET,CAUSE IF THE SWITCH IS CLOSED THAT MEANS THE CIRCUIT WORKS CAUSE IT'S AN ELECTROMAGNET

5442,WELL IF SUN IS SHARING THE CELL THEN ITS WORKING BUT WHEN IT GOES OFF THERE IS NO WORK AND THE FLAG WILL,WHEN THE SUN IS SHITTING THE CEL THEN IT'S ITS WORKING BUT WHEN IT GOES O THEN IT WON'T WORK AN THE FLAG WIL
5443,THE ELECTRICITY WILL GO THROUGH THE D CELL AND IT WILL TURN ON THE FLAG,THE ELECTRICITY WON'T GO THROUGH THE D CELL AND IT WIL'T TURN ON THE FLAG
5444,THE D CELLS ELECTRICITY MAKES THE FLAG MOVE,PRODUCERS ELECTRICITY MAKES THE FLAG
5445,THE ELECTRICITY GOES THROUGH THE WIRES AND UNTIL IT'S CELL AND THEN IT GOES INTERACT WHEN WILL CONTRACTION AND THEN IT MAKES THE FLAG MOVE,THE ELECTRICITY GOES THROUGH THE WIRES AND INTO THE CELL AND THEN IT GOES INTO THAT LITTLE CONTTRACTION AND THEN IT MAKES THE FLAG MOVE
5446,IT MAKES THE FLAG MOVE,IT MAKES THE FLAG MOVE
5447,NO NAIL,NO
5448,AND ELECTRICITY GO THROUGH THE TWO WIRES TO MAKE A FLAG MOVE BECAUSE THE FLAG IS METAL ON BOTH SIDES SO THE METAL TOUCHES THAT IT TURNS ON MAKE THROUGH ELECTRICITY,ITS ELECTRICITY WO THROUGH THE TWO WIRES TO MAKE THE FLOW BLOVE BECAUSE THE FLAG IS METAL ON BOTH SIDES SO WHEN MATTAL TOUCHES IT IT TURNS ON A MAKES ELECTRICITY
5449,THE CELL HAS BEHIND THE SUN AND THEN THE WIRES CONNECT ALL THE WAY TO THE CONTRACTION AND THEN MAKE REFLECTIVE SO ELECTRICITY GOES THROUGH THE FEW THING OVER AND OVER AND OVER,THE CELL HAS TO BE HADING THE SUN AND THEN THE WIRES CONNECT ALL THE WAY TO THE CONTRACTION AND THEN MAKES THE FLAG MOVE SO ELECTRICITY GOES THROUGH THE FULD THING OVER AND OVER AND OVER
5450,IT'S ON THE METAL WHERE THE WIRE IS SO IT DOESN'T COUNT ALL THE WAY BUT IT GOES ON LIKE SO THERE JUST IT IS ELECTRICITY PASS THERE SO THEY WAS ON TOP WHAT A PRETTY AS MUCH ELECTRICITY,IT'S ON THE METAL WHERE THE WIRE IS SO IT DOESN'T GO ALL THE WAY BUT IT GOES ON LIKE HALFWAY SO THE ELCTRICITY ELECTRICITY FASTER SO AF HE WAS ON TOP EIT WOULDN'T PRODU ELCT ELECTRICITY
5451,THE ELECTRICITY GOING THROUGH,THAT ELECTRICITY'S GON GOING THROUGH
5452,BECAUSE THEY DIDN'T THEN IT WHAT IF WORK AS WELL AS A IT'S DOWN SO WHILE WE ITS DARK ANYTHING OUTSIDE WILL NOT WORK,BECAUSE F IT DIDN'T THEN IT WOULDN'T WORK ANDAS WELL AS IT IS NOW SO WHEN  IT'S DARK AND IT'S OUT SIDE WOLL NOT WORK
5453,IT'S NOT GOING TO TILL BECAUSE THE SWITCHES OFF AND IT'S NOT CREATING A CIRCUIT TO MAKE THE FLAG MOVE,IT'S NOT GONNA GO THROUGH BECAUSE THE SWITCH IS OFF AND IT'S NOT CREAO THE CIRCUIT TO MAKE THE FLY MOVE
5454,NO,WELL
5455,IT'S NOT TOUCHING METAL SO WHERE ELECTRICITY WON'T GO TO THE FLAG AND IT WILL MAKE A CIRCUIT,IT'S NOT TOUCHING METAL SO WE ELECTRICITY WON'T GO TO THE FLAG AND IT WON'T MAKE A CIRCUIT
5456,BECAUSE THE D CELL HAS ELECTRICITY IN IT SO WHEN THEN TWO CONNECTERS CONNECT TO THE METAL FIND ON BOTH SIDES AS THE SWITCH TOUCHES METAL THEN IT WILL START WORKING AND CREATE AND PUT IT WOULD ELECTRICITY TO THE FLAG,CAUSE THE D CELL HAS ELECTRICITY IN IT SO WHEN THE TWO CONNECTORS CONNECT TO THE METAL FLAG ON BOTH SIDES AND THE SWITCH TOUCHES METAL THEN IT WILL START WORKING AND CREATE AND PR WIL ELECTRICITY TO THE FLAG
5457,THE D CELL IS AT A CIRCUIT,THE D CELL IS INT A CIRCUI IT THE PTRIC CELL
5458,THOSE ARE ALSO THAT ELECTRICITY SO WHEN YOU PUT TWO WIRES ON THEY AND PUT A SET TO A D CELL AND PUTTING INTO SUN THEN VIBRATING TO BE LIKE THAT ELECTRICITY GOING THROUGH THAT CELL,THOSE ARE ALSO ABOUT THE ELECTRICITY SOME WON YO PUT TWO WIRES ON IT ANTRDUCE IT TO A D CELL AND PUT IT IN THE SUN EN IT TA BYBREATING IGONN STUF DIAT'S THE ELECTRICITY GOING THROUGH THAT
5459,IT HAS TO BE ON THE METAL,IT HAS TO BE ON THE METAL
5460,WE'VE HAS BEEN CREATING CIRCUIT,WE'VE AN CREATING CIRCUIT
5461,THEN IT DOESN'T WORK,THAT IT IS EQ
5462,THAT WHEN I TOUCH IT IT MOVES AND THEN I TOUCH IT AGAIN IT MOVES OFF THE CIRCUIT SO IT WILL PRODUCE THE ELECTRICITY BUT WON'T DOES TOUCH THE METAL AND PRODUCES ELECTRICITY,THAT WHEN I TOUCH IT IT MOVES N THAT WHET I TOUCH IT AGAIN IT MOVES OFF IF THE CIRCUIT SO IT WON'T PRODUCE THE ELECTRICITY WHEN DOWES TOUCH THE LETL IT PRODUCES ELECTRICITY
5463,BECAUSE WHEN THE WIRE FIX THE D CELL AND OTHER ELECTRICITY DOESN'T LIKE CONTRACTED LIKE THEY CONTRACTED TOO,CAUSE WHEN O THE WIRES IT'S THE D CELL ANAO ELECTRICITYY DOESE  THE CONTRACTON MAKES THE TTHIP WORK
5464,THE FLAG MOVES,THE FLAG MOVES
5465,IT WOULDN'T WORK BECAUSE THAT'S BE SEMI AND MIKE HAS BEEN GETTING IT,IT WOULDN'T WORK BCAUSE IT HAS TO BE SUNNY AND LIGHT HAS TOBE HIDDY
5466,ELECTRICITY IS GOING THROUGH IT TO MAKE IT MOVE,ELECTRICITY IS GOING THROUGH IT TO MAKE IT OOM
5467,THE D CELL AND THE ELECTRICITY,THE D CELL AND THE ELECTRICITY A
5468,THE D CELL HAS TO BE ATTRACTED TWO WIRES TO GO THROUGH THE ELECTRICITY TO GET TO THE MOVE,ISALL HAS TO BE ATTO TWO WIRES TO GO  T TO GOS O THE ELECTRICITY TO GET TOO
5469,THE FLAG STOPS MOVING BECAUSE IT DOES THE SUNLIGHT AND IT IS HAVE ELECTRICITY BETWEEN THE WIRES,THE FLAG STOPS VIN BECAUSE IT IT DOESN'T HAVE LIGHT AND IT DOESN A HEAVY ELECTRICITY BETWEN THEE
5470,NO METAL IS PUT TOUCHING THOSE TWO WIRES AND LIKE THAT AND CONNECT STILL JUST READY TO GET THE,METAL IS R TOUCH TO THE IRON SO ICAU I CAU THE EE ELECTRICIY TO GET THE FO
5471,I TALK TO YOU LATER BYE,I'LL TAKT YOU LATER BYE
5472,YOU'RE SEPARATE NO AND THERE ITS IT'S LIKE WE BETTER SO YEAH,JU TU PUT A NAIL IN THERE IT'S IT'S LIKE WAY BETTER SO YEAH
5473,I DON'T KNOW,I DON'T KNOW
5474,ITS FLOWING THROUGH ELECTRICITY,IT'S FLOWING THROUGH ELECTRICITY
5475,ELECTRICITY IS GOING THROUGH IT OKAY,ELECTRICITY IS GOING THROUGH IT OKAY
5476,AND FINNALY MET BEFORE,I'M FINE WE'VE MEAT BEFORE
5477,WE'VE BEEN LEARNING SCIENCE YOU CAN TALKING TO ME ABOUT IT,WE'VE BEEN LEARNING SCIENCE EVER SINCE YOU'VE BEN TALKING TO ME ABOUT IT
5478,YOUR DOWN,YOU'RE DUMGE
5479,BECAUSE THERE NOT METAL LIKE ALL THE OTHER ONCE,CAUSE THEY'RE NOT METAL LIKE ALL THE OTHER ONES
5480,IT WORKS BECAUSE IT'S A METAL,IT WORKS CAUSE IT'S METAL
5481,WE SEEN EACH OTHER BEFORE,WE'VE SEEN EACH OTHER BEFORE
5482,JUST DRAW THE TAPE THE SPIRAL THAT ROCK IN STUFF ARE ALL INSULATORS BUT A OTHER STUFF IS CONDUCTORS,THE STRAW THE TAPE THE SPONGE THE ROCK AND STUFF ARE ALL INSULATORS BUT ALL THOU OTHER STUFF IS CONDUCTORS
5483,ONE THE METAL IS TOUCHING THE SWITCH SO I ALREADY KNOW THAT,TUCHING THIS ONE THE METAL IS TOUCHING THE SWITCH SOYEAN
5484,THE NAIL,THE NAIL
5485,METAL IS SOMETHING IF SOMETHING'S METAL THEN AND IT STICKS TO SOMETHING ALL SIDES METAL THEN IT WOULD WORK AND IT WOULD COMPLETE CONDUCTOR,METAL IF SOMETHING IF SOMETHING'S METAL THEN AN IT STICKS TO SOMETHING ELSE THAD'S METAL THEN IT WOULD WORK AND IT WOULD COMPLETE A CONDUCTOR
5486,BECAUSE THE SWITCH IS METAL SO THAT'S METAL SO IT'S MAKE IN A WORK,CAUSE THE SWITCH IS METAL SO THAT'S METAL SO IT'S MAKING IT WORK
5487,INSULATORS ARE SOME STUFF THAT'S NOT METAL BUT CONDUCTORS ARE THINGS ARE METAL THAT MAKES JUST SITTING,INSULATORS ARE SOME STUFF THAT'S NOT METAL BUT CONDUCTORS OR THINGS THAT ARE METAL THAT MAKES ELECTRICITY
5488,IT'S NOT GOING BECAUSE IF THAT'S NOT METAL THEN WORK,IT'S NOT GOING ECAUSE IF THAT'S NOT METAL THEN IT WON'T WORK
5489,I DON'T KNOW CAN YOU REPEAT THAT PLEASE,I DON'T KNOW CAN YOU REPEAT THAT PLEASE
5490,ELECTRICITY IS GOING TO THROUGH THE NAIL,ELECTRICITY 'S GOING THROUGH WITH A NAIL
5491,ITS OPEN,IT'S OPEN
5492,ALL THE OBJECTS WILL NOT MAKE ELECTRICITY GO,ALL THE OBJECTS WILL NOT MAKE ELECTRICITY GO
5493,YEAH I'M GOOD HOW ARE YOU I KNOW YOU WE MET BEFORE BUT NO I DON'T WANT TO MEET YOU,YEAH I'M GOOD HOW ARE YOU I KNOW WE'VE BENT BEFORE BUT NO I DON'T WANT TO MEAT YOU
5494,BECAUSE THE SWITCHES OFF AND IT'S CREATING A CIRCUIT ELECTRICITY ALL AWAY TO THAT MOTOR,CAUSE THE SWITCH IS OFF AND IT'S CREATING A CIRCUIT AND ELECTRICITY ALL THE WAY TO THAT LANERTAINING MOTOR
5495,THE FLAG IS BEEN MOVING BECAUSE THE D CELL HAS TO BE,THE FLAG IS IT MOVING CAUSE THE D CELL HAS TO BE HOOKED UP TO THE SWITCH
5496,WHEN I CLICK THE SWITCH AND IT GOES ON THE METAL IT WORKS AND GOES TO THE MOTOR CIRCUIT IT CREATE ELECTRICITY OVER THAT IT IS ON IT WON'T WORK,WHEN I CLICK THE SWITCH AND IT GOES ON THE METAL IT WORKS AND GOES TO THE MOTOR SO IT CAN'T CREATE ELECTRICITY BUT WHEN  IS ON IT WON'T WORK
5497,THE CELL IS HITTING THE MOTOR SO WHEN THE CELL HITS THE MOTOR THE WIRES IT ALWAYS TO THAT CELL AND THAT IT'S START WORKING,THE SUN IS HITTING THE MOTOR SO WHEN THE SUN HITS THE MOTOR THE WIRES HI ALL THE WAY TO THE CELL AND THEN IT JUST STARTS WORKING
5498,IT WILL STOP WORKING BECAUSE IT'S NOT CREATING ELECTRICITY,IT WILL STOP WORKING BECAUSE IT'S LOT CREATING ELECTRICITY
5499,IT IS HAVING THE ELECTRICITY GOING TO THE MOTOR MAKE A FLAG MOVE,IS HAVING ELECTRICITY GOING TO THE MOTOR AND MAKING  FLAG MOVE
5500,IT DOESN'T WORK,IT DOESN'T WORK
5501,IT WORKS,IT WORKS
5502,IT DOESN'T WORK,IT DOESN'T WORK
5503,WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT CIRCUITS,WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT CIRCUITS
5504,BECAUSE IF IT DOESN'T HAVE IF THE SUN HAS TO HIT THAT LITTLE CONTRACTION THERE THEN IT WILL WORK,CAUSE IF IT DOESN'T HIT IF THE SUN DOESN'T HIT THA LITTLE CONTRACTIN THERE THEN IT WON'T WORK
5505,WHEN YOU CLICK ON THE CELL ITS STARTS WORKING WILL A STOPS WORKING,WHEN IT WHEN YOU CLICK ON THE SUN IT STARTS WORKING BUT WHAT ITS E CLOUDY DAY IT STOPS WORKING
5506,LET THE SWITCH HAS TO BE OFF,LE THE SWITCH HAS TO BE OFF
5507,THE D CELL IS PUT DOES THE ELECTRICITY ALL AWAY TO THE MOTOR AND MAKING THE FLAG MOVE,THE D CELL IS PRODUCING ELECTRICITY ALL  THE WAY TO THE MOTOR AND LAKING THE FLAG MOV
5508,NO,NO
5509,AND TILL,YOU TOO
5510,THE CELL IS HITTING THE MOTOR AND THE MOTOR SET UP THE TWO WIRES ALL THE WAY TO THE CELL SO WHILE THOUGH THAT CELL DOES HITTING IT IT STARTS WORKING,THE SUN IS HITTING THE MOTOR AND THE MOTOR SOKED UP THE TWO WIRES ALL THE WAY TO THE CELL SO WHEN THE SUN IS HITTING IT IT IT STARTS WORKING
5511,WHAT,WHAT
5512,IT DOESN'T WORK,IT DOESN'T WORK
5513,THE FLAG MOVES,THE FLAG MOVES
5514,IT DOESN'T WORK,IT DOESN'T WORK
5515,ELECTRICITY,ECTRICITY
5516,THAT PUT DOES THE ELECTRICITY,THEY'RE PRODUCING ELECTRICT
5517,IT'S CREATING A CIRCUIT THAT MAKES THE MOTOR RUN AND MAKES THE FLAG MOVE,IT'S CREATING A SECON THAT MAKES THE MOTOR RUN AND MAKES THE FLAG MOVE
5518,THAT IT RUNS WHEN THE FLAG MOVES BECAUSE THE CELL IS GAIN ELECTRICITY FROM THE SUN THAT TWO WIRES ARE HITTING THE MOTOR SO WAS THE TWO WIRES MAKE ELECTRICITY TO THE MOTOR THEN THE FLAG MOVE,THAN IT RUNS AN THE FLAG MOVES BECAUSE THE CELL IS GETTNG ELECTRICITY FROM THE SUN THE TWO WIRES ARE HITTING THE MOTOR SO WHEN WHEN THE TWO WIRES MAKING ELECTRICITY TO THE MOTOR THEN THE FLAG MOVES
5519,THAT IT'S OFF THE D CELL IT'S OFF THIS THE METAL SO IT WON'T MOVE THE FLAG,THAT IT'S OFF THE D CELL IS OFF THE THE METAL SO IT WON'T MOVE THE FLAG
5520,IT MAKES IT WORK,IT MAKES IT WORK
5521,IT WOULD BECAUSE IT'S NOT REALLY SUNNY,IT WOULDN'T WORK BCAUSE IT'S NOT REALLY SUNNY
5522,OKAY,OKAY
5523,THE CELL HAS TO BE HITTING IT,THE SUN HAS TO BE HITTING IT
5524,GOOD,GOOD
5525,THEY MAKE ELECTRICITY GO THROUGH,THEY MAKE ELECTRICITY GO THROUGH
5526,IT WOULDN'T WORK,IT WOULDN'T WORK
5527,NOW ITS GOING THE OPPOSITE WAY BUT ITS GOING SAME WAY BUT IF WAS TURNED AROUND THEY WOULD BE GO IN THE OPPOSITE WAY,NOW IT'S GOING THE OPPOSITE WAY BUT IT'S STILL GOING THE SAME WAY BUT IF IT WAS TURNED OUND IT WOULD BE GOING THE OPPOSITE WAY
5528,ITS GOING THE DIFFERENT WAY ITS GOING LIKE THEN POSITIVE SIDE GO IN THE NEGATIVE SIDE GOING THESE WAY SO ITS GOING TO THE POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE SIDE BUT EVEN LIGHT BULB IS MUST BE ONE TO THE THAT'S I BUT ANYWAY ITS GOING THE OTHER,IT'S GOING THE DIFFERENT WAY IT'S GOING LIKE THEN DPOSITIVE SIDES  GOAND THE NEGATIVE SIDES GOING THIS WAY SO IT'S GOING THOUGH THE POSITIE OTHE NEGATIVE SIDE BUT EVEN THOUGH THOUH LIGHT BULB IS MUST BE GOING THROUGH THAT SIDE BUT ANYWAY IT'S GOING T THE OTHER
5529,LIGHT,LIGHT
5530,OKAY,OKAY
5531,THAN IT WOULD WORK BECAUSE IF IT WAS JUST AT THE BA ARE THE TWO BASES OF BULB AROUND LIGHTS MUST GO UP THE LIGHT BULB SO I WERE WORK EASIER,THEN IT WOULDN'T WORK BECAUSE IF IT WAS JUST AT THE B THE TWO BASES OF YOUR BULB THEN IT WOULDN'T WORK CAUSE THE WIRES PUS GO UP THE LIGHT BULB SO I WOUL WORK EASIER
5532,THE TWO WIRES ARE CONNECTED TO THE NEGATIVE AND POSITVIE SIDE AND THEN THE NEGATIVE GOES TO THE SIDE OF THE METAL OF LIGHT BULB AND THEN POSITVE SIDE GOES UP IN LIGHT BULBS ARE PRODUCES THE ELECTRICITY THROUGH THE LIGHT BULB,THE TWO WIRES ARE CONNECTED TO THE NEGATIVE AND POSITIVE SIDE AND THEN THETHE NEGATIVE GOES TO THE SIDE OF THE MEDTAL OF TH LIGHT BULB AND THEN THE POSITIVE SIDE GOES UP AND THE LIGHT BULB SO T PRODUCES THE ELECTRICITY THROUGH THE LIGHT BULB
5533,I'M GOOD,I'M GOOD
5534,THE ELECTRICITY,ELECTRICITY
5535,TWO WIRES HAVE TO BE CONNECTED TO MAKE A COMPLETE CIRCUIT,TWO WIRES HAVE TO BE CONNECTTED TO ATO MAKE A COMPLETE CIRCUIT
5536,IT HAS TO TAKE A PATH WHEN YOU COLLECT IT,IT HAS TO MAKE A PATH WHEN YOU CONNECT IT
5537,COMPLETE CIRCUITS,COMPLETE CIRCUITS
5538,IT LIGHT UP LIKE IN HER ON A LAMP ELECTRICITY GOES THROUGH AND IT GOES THROUGH UP AND THEN STILL MAKE US BACK UP,IT LIGHTS UP LIKE IN HER ON A LAMP ELECTRICITY GOES THROUGH AND THEN IT GOES UP AND THEN IT O IT GOES BACK O
5539,BOTH SIDE,BOTH SIDE
5540,IT AS HOW YOU ELECTRICITY WAS TO WIRES,IT HAS TO HAVE ELECTRICITY WITH TWO WIRES
5541,THAT THERE IS LIKE THE ELECTRICITY THE LIGHT BULB,THAT THERE'S ALWAYS THE ELECTRICITY FLOWNG THROUGH THE LIGHT BULB
5542,ELECTRICITY,ELECTRICITY
5543,ITS NEGATIVE IN POSITIVE SIDE CONNECTED TO LIGHT BULB,IT'S A NEGATIVE AND POSITIVE SIDE CONNECTED TO THE LIGHT BULB
5544,I NOTICED THAT THE FLIP THIS THAT SHOULD I NOTICED THAT IF YOU'D PUT PUT IT TO THE NOT THE NEGATIVE SIDE THEY WILL GO UP THAT WAY BUT THE PEOPLE ON THE POSITIVE SIDE THEN YOU KNOW GO THE SAME WAY THAT IT WAS IN THE BEGIN,I NOTICE THAT IF YOU FLIP IT THIS THE I NOTICED THAT IF YOU PUT PUT IT TO THE NEGATIVE SIDE THEN IT WILL GO TH OPPOSITE WAY BUT IF YOU PUT IT ON THE POSITIVE SIDE THEN IT W'LL GO THE SAME WAY THAT IT WAS IN THE BIGNG
5545,ITS FLOWING THROUGHT THE LIGHT BULB AND TO THE POSITIVE SIDE,IT'S FLOWING THROUGH THE LIGHT BULB INTO THE POSITIVE SIDE
5546,ELECTRICITY,ELECTRICITY
5547,IF THE CIRCUIT,IT'S A
5548,DO YOU THINK ELECTRICITY,DO THING ELECTRICITY
5549,THE TWO WIRES ARE CONNECTED AND THE METAL IS TOUCHING,THAT TWO WIRES ARE CONNECTED AND THE METAL IS TOUCHING

5554,ELECTRICITY,ELECTRICITY
5555,THAT THEY CAN CONNCET TO EACH OF THEM BUT IF THERE IF THE TWO WIRES BOTH AT THE BASE OF THE SIDE OF THE LIGHT BULB IT GOING TO LIGHT UP HAS IT DOESN'T KNOW,THAT THEY CAN CONNECT TO EACH OF THEM BUT IF THEY WEREIF THE TWO WIRES WERE BOTH AT THE BASE OF THE SIDE OF THE LIGHT BULB IT WOULDN'T LIGHT UP AS IT DOES NOW
5556,THE PLY IS THAT IT HAS TO BE TOUCHING METAL WITH THE TWO WIRES AS WE TOUCHING THE LIGHT BULB THEN ORDER OF TWO,THE POINT IS THAT IT HAS TO BE TOUCHING METAL WITH THE TWO WIRES HAS TO BE TOUCHING THE LIGHT BULBS IN ORDER FOR IT TO LIGHTUP
5557,THE REALLY THROUGH THE WIRES INTO THE LIGHT BULB BACK INTO THE ONE POSITIVE,THROUGH IT THROUGH THE WIRES INTO THELIGHT BULB BACK INSO THEYPOSITIVE

8491,ALL INSIDE IT AND THEN IT WANT,O INSIDE IT AND THEN IT WON'T
8492,I MEAN THAT IS NOT GETTING ENERGY BECAUSE THE SWITCH IS AT ON AND THE WOOD STICK IS LIKE ISN'T A TYPE OF METAL SO IT WON'T WORK,IT MEANS THAT IT'S NOT GETTING ENERGY BECAUSE THE SWITCH ISN'T ON AND THE WOOD STICK ISN'T LIKE ISN'T A TYPE OF METAL SO IT WON'T WORK
8493,CONDUCTING MATERIALS ARE HELPFUL BUT THE REST OF THAT AREN'T WHERE IT'S TO OTHER WAY OVER CAN YOU TELL THAT MARNIE,CONDUCTING MATERIALS OR HELP FUL BUT THE REST OF THEM AREN'T OR ITS THE OTHER WAY AROUND CAN YOU TELL ME THAT MARNIE
8494,THAT WHEN YOU PUT THE WOOD ON THE WOOD STICK IT IS NOT WORKING ANYMORE BECAUSE IT'S NOT TYPE OF METAL OR ITS TYPE OF SOURCE TO MAKE IT,THAT WHEN YOU PUT THE WOOD WOODTHE WOOD STICK IT ISN'T WORKING ANYMORE BECAUSE IT'S NOT A TYPE OF METAL OR TYPE OF SOURCE TO MAKE IT
8495,IT DOESN'T WORK BECAUSE IT'S NOT LIKE STORE OF ENERGY AND BECAUSE A BATTERY WORKS BECAUSE THAT HAS STORED ENERGY INSIDE IT SO,IT DOESN'T WORK BECAUSE IT'S NOT ASOR OF ENERGY AND  BECAUE A BATTERY WORKS BECAUSE IT HAS STORED ENERGY INSIDE IT SO
8496,I SAID THAT YOU NEED A BATTERY WHICH HAS STORED ENERGY INSIDE IT AND THEN YOU NEED TWO WIRES A SWITCH AND A MOTOR,I SAID THAT YOU NEED A BATTERY WHICH HAS STOLED ENERGY INSIDE IT AND THEN YOU NEED TWO WIRES A SWITCH AND A MOTOR
8497,WELL I THINK THAT THE LIGHT THE DOTS ARE THE ENERGY AND LIKE THAT'S WAS JUST SPEAKING THE LIGHT BULB BRIGHTER,WELL I THINK THAT THE E THE DOTS ARE THE ENERGY AND IKE THAT'S WHAT'S  MAKING THE LIGHT BULB BRIGHTER
8498,IT'S JUST TO BE IN A CIRCLE IS VERY HELPFUL BECAUSE THEY HAS BECAUSE THE BATTERY IS GIVING IN ENERGY TO THE D CELL THAT'S HOW THE LIGHT BULB IS GETTING THE ENERGY IMPROVEMENT,ELECTRICITY IN TE CIRCUIT IS VERY HELPFUL BECAUSE IT HAS BECAUSE  THE BATTERY'S GIVING  ENERGY TO THE D CELL AND TAT'S HOW THE TH LIGHT BULB IS GETTING THE ENERGY AND BORM OUT
8499,I DON'T KNOW,I DON'T KNOW
8500,THAT WHEN THOSE ONE LIGHT BULB IT JUST ONE FOCUS AND LIKE WHEN THERE IS A ONE BATTERY IT DOESN'T LIGHT AS MUCH AS THE SECOND ONE BECAUSE THERE IS TWO FOR EACH ONE,WHEN THERE'S ONE LIGHT BULB IT'S JUST ONE FOKUS AND LIKE WHEN THERE'S ONE BATTERY IT DOESN'T LIGHT AS MUCH AS THE SECOND ONE BECAUSE THERE'S STUP FOR EACH ONE
8501,ITS IT WAS THE LIGHT BULBS TURN BRIGHTER BECAUSE IT'S USING TWO BATTERIES AND SO THAT IS TWO STORED ENERGIES INTO LIGHT BULBS,IT'  IT WAS THE LIGHT BULBS TURNED BRIGHTER BECAUSE IT'S USING TWO BATTERIES AND SO THER IS TWO STORED ENERGYE IN TWO LIGHT BULBS
8502,THERE ARE ONE TWO THREE FOUR THERE IS FOUR PATH WAYS TO A SERIES CIRCUIT,THERE ARE ONE TWO THREE FOUR THERE'S FOUR PATHWAYS TO A SERIES CIRCUIT
8503,I THINK THE WORK MAY BE,I THINK IL WORK MAYBE
8504,THE ENERGY STORED IN THAT BECAUSE IT'S GIVING ENERGY TO THE LIGHT BULBS,THE ENERGY IS STORED AND STUFF BECAUSE IT'S GIVING ENERGY TO THE LIGHT BULBS
8505,I THINK THE LIGHT BULBS ARE GOING TO BE BRIGHTER BECAUSE IT'S USING TO TUBE A D CELLS AND LIKE THEY HAVE STORED ENERGY SO IT WILL WORK,I THINK THE LIGHT BULBS ARE GONNA BE BRIGHTER BECAUSE IT'S USING TO TWO D CELLS AND LIKE THEY HAVE SORDOF ENERGY SO IT ILL WORK
8506,CAN YOU REPEAT THAT,CAN YOU BREATH UM
8507,FLOW IN LIKE THE BATTERY AND IT HAS TO HAS TO GO THROUGH THE LIGHT BULB THE WIRES THE D CELL AS TO GO THROUGH LIGHT HAS TO GO THROUGH IT HAS LOT OF THINGS,FLOW IN LIKE THE BATTERY AND IT HAS TO GO THROUGH IT HAS TO GO THROUGH THE LIGHT BULB THE WIRES THE D CELL T HAS TO GO THROUGH WIT IT HAS TO GO THROUGH AIR IT HAS O GO THROUGH A LOT OF THING
8508,I THINK THAT IS THE WIRE IS GETTING ENERGY AND ITS GOING INTO THE LIGHT BULBS SO THE LITTLE BLUE DOTS ARE LIKE THE ENERGY COMING,I THINK THAT IS THE THE WIRE'S GETTING ENERGY AND IT'S GOING INTO THE LIGHT BULB SO THE LITTLE BLUE DOTS ARE LIKE THE ENERGY COMING
8509,IT'S TO BE TOUCHING D CELL AND THE WIRES BECAUSE THE WIRES ARE GOING TO GAIN ENERGY AND BY THAT ONE IS GOING TO BE LIKE A REALLY FUN AND STUFF LIKE THAT SO JUST GET ON THE LAST PART,S TO BE TOUCHING D CELL AND THE WIRES BECAUSE THE WIRES AREGONNA HELP IT GEV MENERGY AND BY THE OR IT'S GON NTA BE LIKE REALLY FUN AND STUFF I GUESS I JUST GUESSED ON THE LESS PART
8510,BECAUSE THEY NEEDS ANOTHER WIRE CONNECTING TO THE PLUS OF THE WIRES AND THERE ARE NOT SUPPOSED TO BE TOUCHING,BECAUSE IT NEEDS ANOTHER WIRE CONNECTING TO THE PLUS OF THE WIRES AND THEY DAREN'T SUPPOSED TO BE TOUCHING
8511,CONNECTING THE SERIES CIRCUIT LIKE IT WOULD NOT BE THE BRIGHT ANYMORE WELL IT WILL BE BRIGHT BECAUSE IT'S ONLY USED I THINK IT WON'T WORK AND I THINK REALLY WORK LIGHT BULBS,N THE SERIES CIRCUIT LIKE IT IT WOULD NOT BE VATBRIGHT ANYMORE WELL IT WILL BE BRIGHT BECAUSE IT'S ONLY USE I THINK IT WON'T WORK AND I IT T WILL WORK BUT THE LIGHT BULB WON'T
8512,MAY BE BECAUSE IF THE WIRES ARE THE BATTERY IS GIVING ENERGY TO THE WIRE AND THAT'S WHY THE LIGHT BULB IS SHINING AND ITS VERY VERY VERY VERY BRIGHT,MAYBE BECAUSE IF THE WIRES ARE THE BATTERY'S GIVING ENERGY TO THE WIRES AND THAT'S WHY THE LIGHT BULB IS SHINING AND IT'S VERY VERY VERY VERY RIGHT
8513,HE IS A COMPLETE FORMAT FOR A LIGHT BULB TO WORK,IT IS A COMPLETE FORMA FOR A LIGHT BULB TO WORK
8514,IT'S LIKE THE ENERGY IS GIVING THE ENERGY IT'S CALLED TO THE LIGHT BULB AND THAT'S HOW ITS GIVING ENERGY I GUESS,IT'S LIKE THE ENERGY IS GIVING THE ENERGY IT'S GOT TO THE LIGHT BULB AND THAT'S HOW IT'S DOING ENERGY I GUESS

11859,SPINNING THE RUBBERBAND AROUND AND SEEING HOW HOW FAR IT GOES,I THINK IT IS ALL A BUN
11860,SYSTEMS ARE ALL ABOUT MEASURING AND DOING SEEING SEEING WHAT HOW THE SYSTEM LOOKS,SYSTEMS ARE ALL ABOUT MEASURING AND DO SAING SEEING WHAT HOW THE SYSTEM LOOKS
11861,WHAT'S GOING ON WITH THAT IS THAT WE HAVE TO LEARN ABOUT PENDULUMS WE HAVE TO LEARN HOW TO P HOW TO DO SCIENCE AND AND TO LEARN MORE THINGS,WHA'S GOING ON WITH THAT IS THAT WE HAVE TO LEARN ABOUT PENDULUMS AND WE HAVE TO LEARN HOW TO PUT HOW TO DO SCIENCS AND AND TO LEARN MORE THINGS
11862,NO SOME OF THEM HOLD TEN OR NINE,NO SOME OF THEM HOLD TEN OR NINE
11863,VERY WELL,T'S VERY WELL
11864,YOU CAN BUILD THEM OUT OF LIFEBOATS YOU CAN BUILD THEM OUT OF WOOD,YOU CAN BUILD THEM OUT OF LIFE BOATS YOU CAN BUILD THEM OUNT OF WOOD
11865,LEARN ABOUT O,LEARN ABOUT ALL
11866,I I THINK I'M NOT SURE I THINK YOU HAVE TO MEASURE THIRTY CENTIMETERS ON THEM AND WE LEARNED HOW TO HOW MANY PENDULUMS THAT IT CAN HOLD AND HOW MUCH WATER IT CAN HOLD,I I THINK I'M NOT SURE I THINK YOU HAVE TO MEASURE THIRTY CENTIMETERS ON THEM AND WE LEARNED HOW TO HOW MANY PENDULUMS IT IT CAN HOLD AND HOW MUCH WATER IT CAN HOLD
11867,ABOUT ELEVEN AND C COULD HAVE TEN AND THE SHORTEST ONE COULD HAVE EIGHT,ABOUT ELEVEN AND C COULD HAVE TEN AND THE SHORTEST ONE COULD HAVE EIGHT
11868,I THINK IT COULD CONNECT TO THE CAPACITY OF THE BOAT WOULD BE WE CAN JUST MEASURE MEASURE EM AND IT CAN BE EIGHTY MILLIMETERS OR SIXTY TWO MILLIMETERS THIRTY EIGHT FIFTY FIVE MILLIMETERS,I THINK IT C CONNECT TO THE CAPACITY OF THE BOAT WOULD BE WE CAN JUST MEASURE MEASURE EM AND IT CAN BE EIGHTY MILLIMETERS OR SIXTY TWO MILLIMETERS THIRTY EIGHT FIFTY FIVE MILLIMETERS
11869,BYE,BYE
11870,I'VE BUILT MINE OUT OF PA OUT OF PAPER CUPS,I BUILT MINE OUT OF PAPE OUT OF PAPER CUPS
11871,FIRST YOU HAVE TO MEASURE A THE BOAT AND SEE AND PUT IT IN THE WATER AND YOU I THINK YOU MEASURE THIRTY CENTIMETERS ON THEM AND THEN YOU'D NEED TO,FIRST YOU HAVE TO MEASURE UP THE BOAT AND C AND PUT IT IN THE WATER AND YOU I THINK YOU MEASURE THIRTY CENTIMETERS ON THEM AND THEN YOUD NEED TO
11872,WHY I THINK THEY GOT A DIFFERENT NUMBER OF PENNIES IS BECAUSE THEY CUTTED THEM SHORTER OR LONGER,WHY I THINK THEY GOT A DIFFERENT NUMBER OF PENNICSES BECAUSE THEY CAUGHT IT THEM SHORTER OR LONGER
11873,I WOULD THINK ABOUT PUTTING PENNIES IN IT OR WATER,I WOULD THINK ABOUT PUTTING PENNIES IN IT OR WATER
11874,I DISCOVERED THAT THE BOAT CAN FIT TWELVE TWELVE PENDULUMS IN THE LITTLE BOAT,I DISCOVERED THAT THE BOAT CAN FIT TWELVE TWELVE PENDULUMS AND IN THE LITTLE BOA
11875,WHEN I WHEN I NOTICED THAT A WASN'T DROWNING THAT MUCH I STARTED PUTTING MORE AND MORE UH PENDULUMS IN EM AND WHEN I DROWNED IT I I GOT MY ANSWER REALLY EASILY,WHEN I WHEN I NOTICED THAT I WASN'T DROWNING THET MICH I STARTED PUTTING MORE AND MORE  PENDULUMS IN EM AND WHEN I DROWNDED I I GOT MY ANSWER REALLY EASILY
11876,WE HAVE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT BOATS AND WE HAVE BEEN PUTTING PENDULUMS IN THE BOATS AND SEEING HOW MANY PENDULUMS CAN FIT INSIDE THE LITTLE BOAT,WE HAVE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT BOATS AND WE HAVE BEEN PUTTING PENDULUMS IN THE BOATS AND SEEING HOW MANY PENDULUMS CAN FIT INSIDE THE LITTLE BOAT
11877,WE,WE
11878,THE LIFEBOATS ARE ALL ABOUT YOU GO YOU CAN GO ON A ROMANTIC DATE YOU CAN,UM GO TO THE RIVER AND GET ON THEM YOU CAN HAVE A PICGNICK IN THEM
11879,WHAT IS GOING ON THERE IS THE PROPELLER IS THE STRING IS MAKING IT BALANCE IT AND IT KEEPS GOING AROUND AND AROUND PROPELLER KEEPS GOING AROUND AND AROUND,WHAT IS GOING ON THERE IS THE PROPELLERS  THE STRING IS MAKING IT BALANCE IT AND IT KEEPS GOING AROUND AND AROUND PURPLE IT KEEPS GOING AROUND AND AROUND
11880,I THINK IT WILL BECAUSE IT HAS TO HAVE MORE POWER ON IT AND IT HAS TO GO UP FARTHER AND I THINK THAT WOULD AFFECT IT,I THINK IT WILL BECAUSE IT HAS TO HAVE MORE POWER ON IT AND IT HAS TO GO UP FARTHER AND I THINK THAT WOULD AFFECT THIT
11881,SO IT HAS ALSO BEEN NICE TALKING TO YOU MARTY,OL IT HAS ALSO BEEN NICE TALKING TO YOU MARNIE
11882,WHAT WE'VE BEEN DOING IN SCIENCE WE WERE WE HAVE BEEN DOING AIRPLANES WE HAVE BEEN SEEING IS THE AIRPLANE PROPELLER CAN FLY,WHAT WE'VE BEEN DOING IN SCIENCE WE WERE WE HAVE BEEN DOING AIRPLANES AND WE HAVE BEEN SEEING IF THE AIRPLANE PROPELLER CAN FLY
11883,THANK YOU,THANK YOU
11884,THANK YOU,THANK YOU
11885,I THINK WHEN SETTING UP YOUR MY EXPERIMENT WAS IT WAS TRICKY TO PUT IT TOGETHER BUT IT WORKED REALLY WELL AND,I THINK WHONE SETTING UP ERT MY EXPERIMENT WAS IT WAS TRICKED TA PUT IT TOGETHER BUT IT WORKED REALLY WELL AND
11886,IT'S GOING VERY WELL MARTY,T'S GOING VERY WELL MARNIE
11887,YOU CAN ALSO CHANGE THE PROPELLER YOU CAN USE FISHING YOU CAN USE FISHING WIRE AND YOU CAN MAKE THE PROPELLER SMALLER YOU CAN MAKE THE THE,YEAH
11888,YOU,YOU
11889,OKAY SO HOW MANY SPINS IT TAKES SPINS ARE FORTY FIVE SPINS IT MADE AND THE DISTANCE IS HOW MUCH METER HOW MUCH METERS YOU MEASURE IT,OKAY SO HOW MANY SPINS IT TAKES SPINS ARE FORTY FIVE SPINS IT MADE AND THE DISTANCE IS HOW MUCH METER HOW MUCH METERS YOU MEASURE IT
11890,SO WHAT THE PARTS OF THE PLANE I USE THE PROPELLER IS MAKING IT SPIN AND THE STRING THE STRAW AND THE STRING IS MAKING IT BALANCE IT,SO WATH THE PARTS OF THE PLANE ARE USED THE PROPELLER IS MAKING IT SPIN AND THE STRING THE STRAW AND THE STRING IS MAKING IT BALANCE IT
11891,I THINK THE KINDS OF THINGS THAT ARE IMPORTANT WHAT MAKES IF FLY IS THE PROPELLER MAKES IT FLY AND THAT THE STRING IS BALANCED AND A AND THAT THE STRAW IS GREAT IS PUT GOOD ON IT,I THINK THE KINDS OF THINGS THAT ARE IMPORTANT WHAT MAKES IT FLY IS A PROPELLER MIKES IT FLY AND THAT THE STRING WITH BALANCE AND A AND THAT THE STRAW IS GR IS PUT GOOD ON IT
11892,I THINK WHAT THAT IS ALL ABOUT IT MAKES THE PROPELLER SPIN AND IF WE DON'T HAVE THE RUBBER BAND IN THE BOTTOM IT'S NOT GOING TO WORK,I THINK WHAT THAT IS ALL ABOUT IT MAKES THE PROPELLER SPIN AND IF YOU DODN'T HAVE THE RURUN N THE BOTTOM IT'S NOT GONNA WORK
11893,YOU HAVE TO THE PROPELLER IS ALL ABOUT MAKING THE PROPELLER SPIN,YOU HAVE TO THE PROPELLER IS ALL ABOUT MAKING THE PROPELLER SPIN
11894,WHEN IT SPINS THE THING ON THE BOTTOM SPINS AROUND TOO WITH IT AND M AND THEN YOU MEASURE HOW MUCH FAR IT WENT,WHEN IT SPINS THE THING ON THE BOTTOM SPINS AROUND TWO WITH IT AND UM AND THEN YOU MEASURE HOW MUCH FAR IT WENT
11895,I THINK THE NUMBER OF SWINGS ISN'T RIGHT BECAUSE YOU HA ALSO THE STRING HAS TO BE BALANCED AND THE PROPELLER HAS TO BE MOVING,I THINK THE NUMBER OF SWINGS IS ANRIGHT BECAUSE YOU H ALSO THE STRING HAS TO BE BALANCED AND THE PROPELLER HAS TO BE MOVING
11896,WITH STRING,NTHE STRING
11897,THANK YOU,THANKY
11898,MARNIE,MARTY
11899,I THINK WHAT IS IMPORTANT ABOUT THE FLYING LINE IS BECAUSE AND IT ATTACHES TO IT AND IT MAKES IT BALANCE AND IF E YOU DON'T HAVE IT ON THE BOTTOM IT'S GONNA NOT GO THAT FAST,I THINK WHAT IS IMPORTANT ABOUT THE FLYING LINE IS BECAUSE IN IT ATTACHES TO IT AND THIT MAKES IT BALANCE AND IF YOU DON'T HAVE IT ON THE BOTTOM IT'S GUN NA NOT GO THAT FAST
11900,OKAY,OKAY
11901,WHAT YOU CAN ALSO DO WHEN THE PARTS ARE ALL WORKING TOGETHER IS YOU CAN PUT THE STRING INTO THE STRAW AND THEN YOU CAN JUST SWING IT ACROSS AND IT BALANCE IT AND IF IT DOESN'T BALANCE IT'S GOING TO WIGGLE A LOT,WELL YOU CAN HAVESO DO WHEN THE PARTS ARE ALL WORKING TOGETHER ITS YOU CAN PUT THE STRING INTO THE STRAW AND THEN YOU CAN JUST SWING IT ACROSS AND IT BALANCE IT AND IF IT DOESN'T BALANCE IT'S GONNA WE UP
11902,OKAY,OKAY
11903,I THINK THAT IF THE STRING ISN'T BALANCED THAT WELL IT'S NOT GONNA WORK IT'S NOT GONNA SPIN IT'S IT'S IT'S JUST NOT GONNA WORK,I THINK THAT IF THE STRING IS IN' BALANCED OWT WELL IT'S NOT GONNA WORK IT'S NOT GONNO SPIN IT'S IT'S JUST NOT GONNA WORK
11904,YEAH THAT'S IT,THE PROPELLER ON IT AND THEN THEY NEED TO JUST STAP WELL THE TO OTHER OTHER UM
11905,I AM VERY WELL HOW ARE YOU MARNIE,I AM VARY WELL HOW ARE YOU MARNIE
11906,I THINK THE OTHER THINGS THAT ARE IMPORTANT WHEN YOU ARE FLYING YOUR PLANE IS THAT IT'S REALLY BALANCED AND IT'S NOT WIGGLING A LOT AND THAT YOUR PROPELLER SPINS,I THINK THE OTHER THINGS THAT ARE IMPORTANT WHEN YOU'R PLNG YOU'R PLANE IS THAT IT'S REALLY BALANCE AND IT'S NOT WHEN BIING A LOT AND THAT YOU PROPELLER SPINS
11907,I THINK THE PROPELLERS ARE ALL ABOUT I AM GUESSING THAT THE PROPELLERS ARE TO KEEP IT BALANCED,I THINK THE PROPELLERS ARE ALL ABOUT I AM GUESSING THAT THE PROPELLERS ARE TO KEEP IT BALANCED
11908,ME TOO,ME TWO
11909,UM WELL MAYBE IT'S YOU HAVE TO PUT THE AIRPLANE HANGING ATTACHED TO A STRING AND YOU HAVE TO SEE HOW IF IT CAN FLY,UM WELL MAYBE IT'S YOU HAVE TO PUT THE AIRPLANE HANGING ATTACHED TO A STRING AND YOU HAVE TO SEE HOW IF IT CAN FLY
11910,BYE IT'S BEEN NICE TALKING TO YOU TOO,BYE IT'S BEEN NICE TALKING TO YOU TOO
11911,I THINK HOW I MIGHT AFFECT IT IS BECAUSE THE SECOND ONE ISN'T REALLY WELL DONE AND IF IT GOES UP IT'S GONNA GO BACK DOWN AND THE FIRST ONE IS GONNA KEEP GOING STRAIGHT,I THINK HOW IT MIGHT AFFECT IT IS BECAUSE THE SECOND ONE ISN'T REALLY WELL DONE AND IF IT GOES UP IT'S GOINNA GO BACK DOWN AND THE FIRST ONE IS GONGNA KEEP GOING STRAIGHT
11912,I THINK IT'S BALANCING IT AND IT'S MAKING THE AIRPLANE FLY,I THINK IT'S BALANCING IT AND IT'S MAKING THE AIRPLANE FLY

11918,THEY CAN GO THROUGH THIN OBJECTS AND ALSO THEY CAN CONNECT TO EACH OTHER WHEN THEY'RE OFF BUT THE MAGNETISM IS SO STRONG BETWEEN THE TWO MAGNETS THAT IT CAN PULL THROUGH THE TABLE,THEY CAN GO THROUGH THIN OBJECTS AND ALSO THEY CAN CONNECT TO EACH OTHER WHEN THEY'RE OFF BUT THE MAGNETISM IS SO STRONG BETWEEN THE TWO MAGNETS THAT IT CAN PULL THROUGH THE TABLE
11919,THIS MAGNET THAT WE'RE SHOWING HERE HAS BEEN CONNECTED CAUSE THE PAPER IS VERY THIN,THIS MAGNET THAT WES SHOWING HERE HAS BEEN CONNECTED CAUSE THE PAPER IS VERY THIN
11920,THE MAGNET CA IS LIFTING UP THE NAIL THAT IS SENDING ELECTRONS TO THE TO THE PAPER CLIP,THE MAGNET C IS LIFTING UP THE NAIL THAT IS SENDING ELECTROTO THE FAVOR CLIP
11921,IF YOU DO NOT HAVE THE STRONGEST MAGNETISM IN YOUR MAGNET IT CANNOT GET THROUGH THICKER THINGS,IF YOU DO NOT HAVE THE STRONGEST MAGNETISM IN YOUR MAGNET IT CAN NOT GET THROUGH THICKER THINGS
11922,NAIL PICKED UP THE NAIL PICKED UP THE PAPER CLIP BUT THEN IT LOST ITS MAGNETISM AND THEN AND THEN THE MAGNET CAME BACK TO GIVE IT MORE MAGNETISM AND IT COULD PICK UP THE PAPER CLIP AGAIN,A NAIL PICKED UP THE NAIL PICKED UP THE PAPER CLIP BUT THEN IT LOST ITS MAGNETISM AND THEN AND THEN THE MAGNET CAME BACK TO GIVE IT MORE MAGNETISM AND IT COULD PICK UP THE PAPER CLIP AGAIN
11923,A NAIL HAS SOME MAGNETISM IN IT TO PICK UP THE UM THE PAPER CLIP,A NAIL HAS SOME MAGNETISM IN IT TO PICK UP THE UM THE PAPER CLIP
11924,THE NAIL CAN ONLY S UM STAY LIKE A MAGNET SO LONG BECAUSE CAUSE IT DOES NOT IT CANNOT KEEP AS A MAGNET CAN THE MAGNETISM THAT STAYS IN IT FOREVER,THE NAIL CAN ONLY S UM STAY LIKE A MAGNET SO LONG BECAUSE CAUSE IT DOES NOT IT CANNOT KEEP AS A MAGNET CAN THE MAGNETISM THAT STAYS IN IT FOREVER
11925,THE NAIL IS USING MAGNETISM TO UM KEEP THE PAPER CLIP ON IT BUT THE PAPER CLIP CAN ONLY STAY ON SO LONG CAUSE THE MAGNETISM UM WEARS OFF AFTER A WHILE,THE NAIL IS USING MAGNETISM TO UM KEEP THE PAPER CLIP ON IT BUT THE PAPER CLIP CAN ONLY STAY ON SO LONG CAUSE THE MAGNETISM UM WEIRS OFF AFTER A WHILE
11926,WELL MAGNETS CAN STICK TO EACH OTHER BECAUSE THEY BOTH HAVE IRON AND THEY CAN ATTRACT BECAUSE THEY'RE ON DIFFERENT SIDES,WELL MAGNETS CAN STICK TO EACH OTHER BECAUSE THEY BOTH HAVE IRON AND THEY CAN ATTRACT BECAUSE THEY'RE IN DIFFERENT SIDES
11927,THE NAIL CANNOT ALWAYS BE A MAGNET AND THE MAGNET IS ALWAYS A MAGNET,THE NAIL CAN NOT ALWAYS BE A MAGNET AND THE MAGNET IS ALWAYS MAGNET
11928,THE NAIL IS NOT A MAGNET SO IT CAN'T PICK UP THE PAPER CLIP WHEN IT'S NOT CONNECTED TO THE MAGNET,THE NAIL IS NOT A MAGNET SO IT CAN'T PICK UP THE PAPER CLIP WHEN IT'S NOT CONNECTED TO THE MAGNET
