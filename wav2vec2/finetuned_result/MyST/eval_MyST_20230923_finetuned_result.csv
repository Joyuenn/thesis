1292,ACTUALLY THE WIND MIGHT ALSO BE HELPING EVAPORATE,TH BE HELPIN E VOPERATE
1293,WELL JUNGLE IS FOR MOISTNESS CAUSE IT HAS MORE RAIN BUT DESERT HAS EVEN IF YOU DID PUT A LITTLE WATER THERE IT'D EVAPORATE REALLY QUICKLY CAUSE THE TEMPERATURE IS SO HOT,ANGL IS FMOIST NET AS  HAS  A EVEN O DET TH BU WATER IN  THE AS THE TEMPRIS O
1294,DIFFERENT,ER
1295,WHEN IT'S WARM IT LOSES MORE BECAUSE UM WHEN IT'S WARM THAT HELPS THE EVAPORATION,ERMZ ARMBECAARM HELP SM ARVATION
1296,IT WOULD EASILY COME AND EVAPORATE THE WATER,IT WILL EASLY CM EVER WATER
1297,WHEN THE AIR'S FULL OF MOISTURE OR WHEN IT'S HUMID WHEN WELL WHEN THE AIR IS FULL OF MOISTURE IT HAS LESS CHANCE OF EVAPORATING BUT IT'S HUMID IT HAS A WAY BETTER CHANCE OF EVAPORATING,THE A  SHOR WEN A FMOISTERM BATER CHANPC PERATED
1298,UM BECAUSE IT'S PUSHING IT AWAY FROM THE HEAT,BECAUSE  PUSH WAY FROM THE
1299,IT EVAPORATES AND SOMETIMES IT MAKES A LITTLE RAIN CLOUD,VOPERATES  OSF
1300,IT EVAPORATES LESS THAN THE DESERT,CVPERATE WET IN THE DESERT
1301,WELL CAUSE WELL IT KINDA SLOWS IT DOWN CAUSE IT PUSHES THE WATER AWAY INSTEAD OF BRINGING IT NEARER FOR THE UM TEMPERATURE TO EVAPORATE,AE COS  PUSHS THE WATERY WASTTE TEMPEA
1302,GOOD THANK YOU,AN
1303,UM WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT EVAPORATION,WE CEN WDERABOUT ATION
1304,WHEN IT'S VERY COOL LIKE TWENTY TWO OR TWENTY DEGREES OR LOWER IT ONLY LOSES ZERO OR ONE MILLILITER,ON VERY C TWENTEY TWO OR TWENT ZERO  ONE LEADER
1305,NO I'M TRYING TO SAY THAT MORE WATER EVAPORATES IN A DESERT THAN IT DOES IN A JUNGLE,TRYN TO SAV  WATER HEBS IN THE DESERTR ESUNGL

1374,WELL MOST OF IT WENT THROUGH AND UM SOME OF IT STAYED ON THE ROCKS TO LIKE MAKE THE ROCKS WET WET AND YEAH THE REST WENT THROUGH,WETSOMESTAED ON THE ROCKTA AAE  BAWAM FRYOU
1375,THE AMOUNT OF WATER THAT DRAINED THROUGH THE GRAVEL WAS LESS THAN THE IT WAS MORE THAN THE SOIL BECAUSE THE SOIL ABSORBS THE GRAVEL DOES NOT,AMOUNT  TER TE REEME WAS EN THOR TNSOBECAUS I SOES
1376,WELL THE WATER DRAINAGE OF THE ROCKS REALLY DOESN'T MAKE THEM THAT HEAVY BECAUSE THEY'RE ALREADY HEAVY AND IT DID NOT ABSORB,THE WATER TANS THE ROCKDSMAK MHEV BECAUSE RADY T ABSARBE
1377,YOU PUT IT ON GRAVEL AND IT GOES THROUGH IT GO IT DOESN'T ABSORB ANYTHING,THE PUTS ON CABTHE AGO CAIT DOEST ABSARBE ENEY TING
1378,THE HOT WATER IS LESS DENSE THAT IS WHAT IT TELLS ME,THE HT WATER IS W ST
1379,UM I WOULD SAY IT GOES UP OR NORTH AND BECAUSE THE WATER PUSHES IT UP AND THAT SHOWS IT'S LESS DENSE,SA IT GROWS BECAUSE THE WATER PUSHS IT THE SD TAMPTES
1380,THEY FLOAT CAUSE THEY HAVE LESS DENSITY THAN THE WATER,THE FOT C  WATER
1381,WE'VE BEEN DOING WATER AND TODAY WE SAW THINGS FLOAT AND SINK ACTUALLY DIDN'T BUT WE PUT HOT WATER AND COLD WATER AND HOT WATER WENT TO THE TOP COLD WATER WENT TO THE BOTTOM CAUSE THEY PUT FOOD COLORING IN,EV WN WATER IN TAY E NOTHINK HL COLD WATERINH BTM
1382,GOOD BYE MARNIE,GOOB

1411,UM THEY ARE ALL UM YEAH THEY ALL UH THEY ALL HAVE THE SAME AMOUNT OF WATER JUST IN DIFFERENT CASES,ITHH VEN SE   WOTER JOUST IN DIFRNT CACES
1412,THE WATER ON THE SURFACE IS TOUCHING UM THE SIDE OF THE CONTAINER,HE WATER ON THE SIRCUS IS CHING ON THE SIGDE OVE THCUNOR
1413,EACH ONE LOSES HALF,EACH WON  HAF
1414,THIS AREA IS THE AREA OF THE WATER,THE E IS EROF THE WATER
1415,UM I'VE BEEN UM DOING EVAPORATION AND TODAY WAS THE SECOND DAY OF WHERE WE PUT STUFF IN PLACES LIKE THE REFRIGERATOR THE CEILING THE WINDOW SILL THE CORTEC COMPUTER,WEVEPERRATION IN A WIT SCN WEAT N HWINDOW UT THE COMPUTER
1416,IT'S ABOUT HOW WIDE THE THING IS IT WAS JUST HALF BECAUSE IT'S SO WIDE AND AVAILABLE TO BE EVAPORATED,I TFG CUS IBL COBE VAPERATED
1417,TWO HUNDRED SQUARE CENTIMETERS,TOOUR
1418,WELL THE HOTTER THE ROOM AND THE WIDER THE SURFACE AREA THE MORE IS EVAPORATING,W HA AEBM WHY  THE CIRCUS E
1419,GOOD THANK YOU,TANK
1420,T THE PAPER TOWEL GOT WET AND SOON THE WATER WAS GONE BUT YOU COULD SEE THAT IT HAD TAKEN THE WATER INTO ITS MATERIAL,THE PER U  GONYOU CAN SE T IN WATER I ATERIALED
1421,UM WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT WATER AND UM DOING LOTS OF FUN EXPERIMENTS AND AND WE'VE PLAYED WITH NORMAL AND SOAPY AND EVEN SALT WATER,WE CA WAWATER  DWEEN WATCH XPERMONT  W  WIH NORMAL N SY AD EVEN SL WATER
1422,JUST A SPOT OF WATER BUT IF UM BUT AS IT I PUT MORE DROPS AND IT LOOKED STARTED TO LOOK LIKE A DOME,I PUTM DROPS ANSTARTED TO LOKE LIKE A JM
1423,YES IT WAS REALLY INTERESTING TO DO THAT AND LEARN ALL ABOUT THE AND YOU LEARNED SOME ABOUT WATER THAT I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW,AS REALLY INTOSTING UAHE NARD B ATERVENNOW
1424,YOU HAVE TO TILT THE PAPER AND SOMETIMES IT DOESN'T WORK EVENTUALLY IF YOU TILT IT ENOUGH IT DOES,L THE PAPERSUMTM
1425,THANK YOU YOU ARE VERY KIND,SANKEE AE VERY C
1426,BECAUSE THE ALL THE UM DROPS OF WATER I THINK THEY GO TOGETHER AND JUST THEY MAKE THAT SHAPE AND CAUSE IT'S A CERTAIN MATERIAL IT DOESN'T JUST FALL FLAT,BECAUS HE MOP WATER O TOTHERUST MK TECAUS I MATERIAL DSAT
1427,WATER TENSION IS THE THING THAT MAKES IT SHAPE LIKE ANYTHING IT WANTS TO BE LIKE,AR TENTION IS THE ANG TAT MAKS SHAVE LIKE
1428,IT I MEANT BY LIKE WHAT AS WHEN YOU PUT IN MORE DROPS ON THE UM SOAPY WATER IT CAN HOLD LESS THAN A PENNY CAN HOLD WITH NORMAL WATER,WEN YOU PA OR ROPTS ON THE SILVER WATER ICAN HOLD VAST  PNY CAN HOLD NORMAL ATER
1429,IT LOOKS LIKE A TEAR DROP,IT LOKED LIKE A EGIRAWB
1430,SO THE PUDDLE WAS SO COOL IT WAS JUST LIKE A DOME WHICH I BELIEVE IS THE SCIENTIFIC TERM FOR SOMETHING,THM BLEVE IS A SINTIICTRSEVN
1431,BYE SHE'S,
1432,GOOD THANK YOU,GOOD THANKING
1433,IT GOES UP INTO THE AIR,EGOS UIN TO THE AIR
1434,UM OH WAIT SORRY I,P
1435,M COLD COLD WATER,COLDWATER
1436,WELL UM IN ONE IT'S COLD WATER WHICH CAUSES SURFACE TENSION TO BREAK AND UH WATER VAPOR TO BE SEEN THEN EVENTUALLY GOES UP TO AIR AND TURNS INTO WHAT IT WAS,COLD WATER AU TH SIRCUS SI  TEBSN TE OES
1437,WELL WE'VE BEEN DOING CONDENSATION AND EVAPORA AND THEN MOSTLY CONDENSATION BUT A LITTLE BIT OF EVAPORATION,WAL WE'VE BEN OING CTEMIZATION D FORN MOCON VEZATION VPERATION
1438,UM WELL SOME THING'S THAT EVAPORATE ARE WATER AND WATER HOT WATER COLD WATER ANY KIND OF WATER,WIH SOM THING APERAT ATERCLWATER TER
1439,ALL ABOUT THE WIND CARRYING THE WATER IN THE AIR TO DIFFERENT PLACES,BO CARRYING TH WATER IN THE A DIFR ASEIS
1440,LIKE A BIG LAKE OR YEAH BIG LAKE AND WET,I A BIG  I
1441,K PEOPLE MAKE CONDENSATION CHAMBERS TO SEE IF CONDENSATION HAPPENS IN THE CHAMBER,EPLE MA CON TEMTATION CHAMBERON SA CON VERSATION N  CHABER
1442,UM WATER EVAPORATES AND HOT WATER AND COLD WATER EVAPORATES TOO WELL THAT'S STILL WATER BUT YEAH,AER HE ON TH WATER ON COLD WATER VABEATED HE

1445,TRUE,TRAUW
1446,WATER DROPLETS FORM AT WHATEVER PART HAS SPACE THEY GET SEPARATED INTO LITTLE LITTLE LITTLE ONES MAKE REALLY BIG A REALLY BIG ONE,THER OS RM  E W  A  BIG
1447,GOOD,GOD
1448,UM IT'S KIND OF LIKE THE VAPOR VERSION OF WATER,BLIKE THE VAVSION OF WATER
1449,ELEVEN TWENTY FOUR SEE ONE ONE TWO FOUR CONNECTION LOST PRESS OKAY AND WAIT FOR MARNIE OKAY,Y ALEBT H WATER T I  YOU CAN SE WON VIBR IBA
1450,TRUE,TROE
1451,WELL CONDENSATION,GANIZATION
1452,UM IT'S LIKE LITTLE CIRCLES BUT WHEN IT GOES ON THE HOT SURFACE YOU CAN ACTUALLY SEE IT AND WHEN YOU TOUCH IT IT BECOMES LITTLE DROPLETS LIKE LITTLE RAIN DROPS TEARS THAT KIND OF THING,K IDO CIRCUN AURISOOUHITBECUMES SWEATOF
1453,UM IT WAS ABOUT SEEING IF CONDENSATION HAPPENED IN THE CHAMBER,IT IS ABOUT SING F CON VCASIO IN THE CHAMBER
1454,HELLO MY UM,VOT MY
1455,YEAH WELL IT'S NOT THAT LOUD,WIL  NOT THA ALLOW
1456,MMM THEY ATTRACT TO ANY PIECE WITH WELL IT DEPENDS WITH ANY PIECE WITH IRON IF THEY HAVE IRON IN IT BECAUSE THERE'S A MINUS AND A PLUS SIDE,THRAT T WITWILL PLA ITH ENEY PESE WITH O   BECAUSE TS  ON  ILD
1457,YEAH AND IT'S A LOT OF COM IT'S PRETTY COMPLICATED,THE   PR COMPATED
1458,THE IT IT DOESN'T WORK DOESN'T IT IT JUST DOESN'T DO ANYTHING IT JUST STAYS WHERE IT IS,DOSN'T WARK U  THINK THSTA S
1459,THE SWITCH I JUST HAVE TO HIT IT,THE WICHARE YOU DUST TET
1460,CAUSE WE DON'T HAVE STRONG ENOUGH BATTERIES WE JUST USE D CELL BATTERIES,ECAUS W T STRONG INOF BTER SALLBS
1461,JUST THAT THE POWER WAS STRONGER AND,JUST HE R DW
1462,THEY JUST PUSH IT FORWARD BUT THERE'S LIKE THIS MAGNETIC FIELD IN IT THAT'S BLOCKING IT AND JUST PUSHING IT OUT BUT THEN WHEN YOU CLAMP IT JUST AND THEN YOU LET GO IT JUST FLIES OUT,THJUST PUSHURBA K TELD  B LAM R IN THE L
1463,A THE REPELLING,I
1464,Y Y IF ONE OF IT HAS IRON IN IT YES,FONE BET HAS IRE
1465,THEN THE ELECTRICITY IS BROKEN A CIRCUIT,TH THELECTISOY IS BRONI
1466,MMM YEAH,
1467,UM THE BATTERY WAS JUST GIVING THE ELECTRICITY AND POWER FOR IT TO FLOW THROUGH AND THEN YEAH DO IT MAKE A CIRCUIT AND THEN MAKE ALSO A MAGNET AT THE SAME TIME,THEBAENG  JGIVENG THE LUG  STEMG AERFOFLO THROWK THE SIRCK THE SAME TIME
1468,UM IF YOU TURNED IT WELL THE SWITCH CAN ACTUALLY TELEGRAPH THE THING YOU HAVE TO TAKE THE UM SWITCH AND HIT IT AGAINST THE METAL PART,THE W TELGRAFE TI SWACH N HATED GST
1469,MAGNETIC F MAGNETIC FORCE UH I IT UM IF THE NOTHER MAGNET THEN YOU CAN ATTACH LIKE NOT JUST BE ATTRACTED AND,AGE O ITS E  MI THE U A TABTRACT
1470,UH JUST LIKE ONE CENTIMETER AWAY FROM YOU,US IKE S MAT
1471,IT WOULD LIKE FROM FAR AWAY LIKE IF YOU PUT THE METAL BAR FAR AWAY THEN IT WILL CON STILL DO IT AND THEN YOU CAN SHOW HOW HOW STRONG IT IS,AE LIK YO PUT THE MBER  STILL DW
1472,IT'S A PATHWAY FOR ELECTRICITY,PATHWAY BTISY
1473,A,
1474,SO SO WHEN YOU KEPT HITTING THE THING WITH THE BAR THAT ON THE SWITCH THEN THE THERE'S THIS BAR HERE THAT WAS HITTING ON THE RIVET,SR WEN YOU PT THE SING WITH A BAR  WE ERS  BAR   IN OM THE RAIN
1475,YEAH,ELDS
1476,THEN IT HITS IT BUT THEN IT STICKS SO THAT'S WHY YOU HAVE TO HIT IT BACK AND FORTH REALLY QUICK,TS BER STICKSAL CHE   DI IN FOTH
1477,PAPER WELL PAPER CLIPS DO WORK BUT PAPER CLIPS AND PAPER CLIPS DON'T STICK TOGETHER,W  THPB CANPA TKATHERE
1478,THEY'RE INSIDE THE WIRES THE ELECTRICITY IS FLOWING,THENSIDE THE WAER
1479,ME MAYBE POSSIBLY YEAH,MA BE CAUTIOUSLY
1480,NO,
1481,TH THEY WOULD JUST BEING USED,SA JUST E U
1482,IT MAKES THE BAR HIT AGAINST THE RIVET,ITMAK TE BH AO THE RA
1483,YEAH,
1484,YEAH IT'S A MAGNET BUT THE MAGNET WAS USED TO ALSO MAKE UM THE TALKING CLICKS,FRAMINT WAS YOUST THK
1485,NORTH AND NORTH WON'T ATTRACT SOUTH AND SOUTH WON'T ATTRACT I THINK,NORTH WO'T ATRACT S SOUTHK
1486,THE ELECTRICITY DID SOMETHING TO IT,THE LECTD  SOMTHING
1487,YEAH YEAH,ER
1488,WELL WITH OTHER EXPERIENCE WE DID IT,G WIT  EXPERIONS
1489,YEAH THE ELECTRICITY WAS F FING JUMPING,LEC TISOTY WI A SING JAMP
1490,UM SOUTH AND NORTH WOULD ATTRACT,SOUTHNORTHIL BTRACT
1491,YEP,
1492,DO,TWO
1493,YEP,
1494,YOU COULDN'T IT JUST SCREW IT JUST JUST RICOCHETS OFF IT IT DOESN'T STAY,UICRED SHADES ODDN'T SA
1495,IN FIVE WIRES,FIVE
1496,YEAH,Y
1497,YEAH BUT IT ALSO WORKED AS A TELEGRAPH THING,ALSO OW THE A
1498,UH NOPE,
1499,YEAH SO IT JUST CUTTING THE CIRCUIT,AGT UN THE CIRCUS
1500,THE NEGATIVE AND THE A UWE WELL WE SHOULD JUST SAY NORTH AND SOUTH,NEDO VN THE WE HUL  SA NORTH N SAR
1501,YEAH,
1502,I JUST FELT IT AS I DON'T KNOW JUST MORE ELECTRICITY AND,WV JUST LTE AUST RL SSIOMS
1503,THE BAR THAT HITS THE RIVET,THE BAD
1504,NOPE,
1505,S BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT WORKS THE BEST,BECAUSE THAT LIKES THE BEST
1506,YEAH,YELLW
1507,O TH WELL THE DREDGE BAR OR THE BAR THAT HITS THE RIVET,THE FRENSH BA OTHE BAT
1508,METAL,MT
1509,UM YOU CAN S S FLIP THE RIB RIVET AROUND AND THEN SEE IF IT WORKS,YOU CAN LIT THE  AZIR OUS
1510,MAYBE I DON'T REALLY KNOW,UWILLINGN
1511,UH WE HAD A GROUP AND THE WE TALKED WITHIN EACH OTHER,WE A THN WE TALK HER
1512,NO WE ALL USED THE SAME THING,BE ALL US THE SAME THINGS
1513,YOU CAN DO A MANUAL ONE WHICH YOU JUST TAKE TH THE BUTTON AND THEN JUST FLICK IT AND JUST CA E CA DO THE CLICKING THING,YOU CAN SMA WI JUST TAK THE BUON UST
1514,IT WOULD BE A LOT MORE POWERFUL,B
1515,THE ELECTROMAG YEAH,
1516,THE BAR IRON SOME SORT OF METAL THAT MAGNETS LIKE AND THAT STUFF THAT ATTRACT LIKE,TE BI SOME SORT OF METOW THLIKE A ST TRAC
1517,THE BUT WHAT THE PROBLEM IS IS THAT WE ONLY HAD JUST THREE WIRES SO WE CAN'T USE THREE WIRES TO A TO ATTACH TWO BATTERIES TO THE SWITCH,THE BUMEONLY A JUST THREE ALLSER W AEAT THREE WUCE   TAMT T BA
1518,THE PLUS SIDE IS THE POSITIVE AND THE MINUS SIDE IS THE NEGATIVE SIDE,THE I  THPASUT  T INSIDE NEO
1519,MMM YES BECAUSE IF THE POSITIVE SIDE DOES NOT TOUCH THE BOTTOM AND THE NEGATIVE SIDE DOESN'T TOUCH THE SIDE IT IT WON'T TURN ON,YECAS THE SSD DOS NOT TACH THE BOTUM O SIDE  TURN ON
1520,OKAY,OKAY
1521,AFTER THAT THE THE LIGHT BULB LIGHTS UP,TER THAT MY
1522,THE ELECTRICITY MOVES THROUGH THE WIRE AND INTO THE LIGHT BULB,THE TSION OOPED TRO THE WAR  ENTERD THE M
1523,YES,YAS
1524,YES THEY'RE IMPORTANT,APARTMENT
1525,I THINK IT'S ABOUT THE JUST BOTH SIDES HAVE TO TOUCH THE LIGHT BULB SOME,JUST BTH SIDES HAVE TO TACH THE LIGHE SOM
1526,YOU CAN USE TWO WIRES AND CONNECT EACH WIRE TO ONE OF THE SIDES TO THE NEGATIVE AND POSITIVE AND CONNECT BOTH WIRES TO THE LIGHT BULB,YOU CAN A TOBARES IN  EACH W W SI THE ASTBTH R THEM
1527,THE WIRES AND THE BATTERY DIDN'T LIGHT THE LIGHT BULB BECAUSE BECAUSE THEY WEREN'T IN THE RIGHT PLACES,THE WI  TH BUTTER DIDN'T LIKE TE LI BECAS BECAUSE THE W IN TH I PLAS
1528,YES IT DIDN'T LIGHT THE LIGHT BULB,HO DIDN'T LIKE T LABR
1529,THEY'RE IMPORTANT BECAUSE WITHOUT THE NEGATIVE OR POSITIVE SIDE THE LIGHT BULB CAN'T LIGHT LIGHT UP,IMPORTMNT BECASE WITHOT THEST INSDE THE LI BOB ALIGHT UP
1530,THE TWO LINE IS THE D CELL AND THE SWIRLY THINGS ARE THE LIGHT BULBS,TWO NINE I D SELIN HWEVY SING AR TH

1548,A CIRCUIT IS UM A OPEN CIRCUIT IS IF IT HAS A HOLE,IRCUOPEN CIRCUS  HAS
1549,GOOD I GUESS,R
1550,IF IT'S AN OPEN CIRCUIT THEN IT WON'T THE BATTERY WON'T GIVE ENERGY TO THE TO THE MOTOR,T N OPEN CIRCUTHEA GVS EMAGY TO THE THTER

2383,CAN I SAY SOMETHING TO YOU,COUL YOU SINGE SOMTHING TO OU
2384,IT'S SLOWER THAN A R IT'S SLOWER THAN JUST ONE BULB,SLOER THEN JUST ONE VOOM
2385,TWO BATTERIES ARE POWERING IT,TWO BAS
2386,IT'S FLOWING RIGHT SIDE,LOWONG RSIDE

2396,WHEN I CLICK ON IT IT,WHEN  LIC
2397,IT'S GOING FASTER AND FASTER AND FASTER,FAST
2398,IT'S COMING FROM THE BATTERY BECAUSE THE ENERGY FLOWS THROUGH THE LIGHT BULB UP AND OUT AND INTO ANOTHER LIGHT BULB AND UP AND OUT IN THROUGH THE BATTE,IT UM FROM THE BATER BECAUSE ENAGY LOWS NTERA OTHER OWT
2399,WE LEARNED ABOUT PUTTING TWO LIGHT BULBS AND TWO BATTERIES WITH CIRCUITS,WE LURD NTO LIBLS TO BAERS ITH SARC

2479,GOOD,GOOD
2480,IS VERY GOOD UH COULD YOU BE A LITTLE MORE PACIFIC,T IS VERY GOODCAN OU BE  PATITIC
2481,BYE BYE BYE BA BA BYE BYE BYE,OB
2482,AND WELL I NEED HELP HI,BECAUSE ITS AOL JUST WING SOMEDIFRENT LIKE L OMTHINGK
2483,IF YOU HAVE A MAGNET RIGHT HERE ON THIS PIECE ON THE BIG PIECE OF PAPER AND A MAGNET RIGHT HERE ON THE THIN PIECE OF PAPER AND A PENCIL RIGHT HERE IT WON'T BE STRONG ENOUGH TO PULL TOWARDS THIS WITH A PENCIL BEHIND IT,WE HAV AIGAERO APER TWILL BE STRONG NOF EBE
2484,THE FORCE OKAY,OKA
2485,WELL THE NAIL HAS A MAGNETA FIELD AROUND IT SO IF YOU PUT THE MAGNET ON IT AND PUSH IT DOWN IT'S LIKE THE MAGNET WILL STICK TO THE PAPER CLIP ALWAYS,FELD AROUTHA ON  PUSH IT DOWN KHE MSTICKS TO THE PAT ALWAYS
2486,IT'S BASICALLY JUST IT'S BASICALLY THE PAPER CLIP IS ALWAYS GONNA BE MAGNETIZED RATHER WHAT YOU DO IT'S GOING TO BE MAGNETIZED BUT IF YOU HAVE SOMETHING TOO THICK THE MAGNET WON'T STICK TO THE PAPER CLIP,THAPRF  ALWS MACAN BE MAGFO OFTIN TOO TI STICK TO H PA
2487,THE NAIL ISN'T FORCING THE PAPER CLIP UP TO IT BECAUSE THE MAGNET'S OFF IT AND ALSO THE FORCE IS OFF IT SO THE MAGNET STILL HAS A FORCE AND ABSERBED IT LIKE IT UP,THSING THE PABER P UP TOWIT BECAUS TH S NORIS TMASTOE HAS A FORST
2488,WELL MOSTLY I'VE BEEN LIKE JUST TRYING TO DISCOVER WHAT ELSE IS MAGNETS BY RUBBING A MAGNET ON SOMETHING THAT'S NOT MAGNETIZED AND IT WORKED,MOSTLY  KETRYING TO DCAOVER WITH ELS MAGMENTS UBING  MAGMET ON SOM THING THATS NOT MAGMATIZED R
2489,BECAUSE OF THE FORCE IS FORCING IT TO STICK TOGETHER,BECAUSE THE FOR  FFOR STICK TO GETHER
2490,OKAY SO IT'S THE GRAVITY IT'S CALLED A FORCE AND IF IT DOESN'T STICK THAT'S FORCING IT AWAY FROM IT,THE RAB EAT CALLD STIK ON
2491,THE NAIL WON'T PICK UP THE PAPER CLIP BECAUSE IT'S NOT MAGNETIZED YET,TH APER BCAS S NOT MAGATIED YET
2492,THE NAIL ISN'T PICKING UP THE PAPER CLIP BECAUSE THE FORCE IS ALWAYS IN THE MAGNET,PAKING UP THE PAPERBECUS THHOR IS ALWAYS INA
2493,NETISM BASICALLY IS VERY VERY IMPORTANT,AIS ONLY A SWEAIS VERY VERY EMPOURTON
2494,CAUSE THE NAIL IS GETTING THE MAGNETIC FORCE FROM THE MAGNET SO FOR INSTANCE IF YOU KEPT DOING IT IT WILL MAKE THE PAPER CLIP STICK,BECAUS THE IS EING THE MAT ORN H PA STICKS
2495,IT'S CALLED A SHOW FLOW,SHOFLOW
2496,EVERYTHING WILL DROP BECAUSE MOST OF THE RINGS ARE GETTING STUCK FROM THE MAGNET,EVE THING WILL O BECAS MOST THE INAR STARTS FROM THE T
2497,THE RIVET IS UM SURROUNDED BY ALL THE WIRES THAT ARE TYING IT UP,THE REA IS SUR ROUNDED BIY ALL THE BATERES VER T T UPT
2498,OKAY OKAY CAN WE JUST MOVE ONTO ANOTHER THING,JUST ROBOUT TO AN NOTHER THING
2499,BECAUSE ALL THE ENERGY FLOWS AROUND AND AROUND AND AROUND AND AROUND THE RIVET AND GOES BACK INTO THE BATTERY AND DOES IT AGAIN,BECAUSE THE ENERGY FLOWS M RO THE O
2500,CAUSE IF THE SWITCH IS CLOSED THAT MEANS THE CIRCUIT WORKS CAUSE IT'S AN ELECTROMAGNET,ASTHE SWEAT I LOTHES DT MEAN THE IRCWRLLE
2501,EVERYTHING WILL FLY UP,EVERY THING CA FLIYOP
2502,CLO HO HOSE,
2503,SO ALL THE ENERGY CAN COME AND STICK TOGETHER,LIENARGY CA UM IN STICKS TO GEATHER
2504,THAT MEANS IT'S AN OPEN CIRCUIT,THAT MEAAN OPEN CIRCUS
2505,BECAUSE THE ENERGY IS IT'S BECAUSE IT'S CALLED AN ELECTROMAGNET DUM DUM,CAUS THE IMAGY BECAUSE IS LD I ALLETR

2510,THE CIRCUIT IS UH IT'S A OPEN CIRCUIT NOW CAUSE THE SWITCH IS NOT ON,I  OPEN CIRCUS NOWBTHE
2511,IT WILL JUST STICK TO EVERYTHING,EIT WIL JUST STICK TO EVERY THING
2512,IT WHEN IT'S CLOSED THAT MEANS ALL THE ENERGY FLOWS THROUGH A CLOSED CIRCUIT,WEN ECLOTHES TAT MENS THE IMARGRY

2658,IF YOU DON'T USE ACCURATE MEASUREMENTS THEN IT COULD UM LET'S SAY YOU DO ONE THAT'S EIGHT CENTI,YOU DON'T LEASE ERTN R
2659,UM THERE WE DESIGNED THEM TO HOLD PENNIES AND TO HOLD A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF WATER AND TO SEE HOW UM MUCH WATER THEY COULD HOLD,THWE DESIN THEM TO HOLD MNYS IN HOLLD AATER ATER
2660,OKAY I'M NOT SURE ON THIS ONE,NOTSR
2661,IF THE WATER IS LIKE HA IT'S REALLY TALL WAVES IT'LL KNOCK EM OVER BUT IF IT'S CALM AND KIND OF FLAT AND JUST SITTING THERE THEN IT'LL BE EASIER TO STACK THEM,THWATER IS A RALLY BAS LTH  CARMTUR OBEASIER TTM
2662,IF YOU ONLY CHANGE IF YOU CHANGE ONE VARIABLE AT A TIME IT WILL BE EASIER TO SEE IF YOU'RE DOING IT RIGHT OR WRONG,NLY CHAE YOU CHANGE ONE VERBTTIME WILL BE EASIER TO SU AONG

2672,AT ONE TIME YOU COULD,TIME
2673,IF THEY'RE SMALLER THEN IT'LL BE HARDER TO PUT MORE PENNIES IN AND IF THEY'RE BIGGER IT'LL BE EASIER SINCE THEY'RE TALLER AND YOU CAN PUT MORE PENNIES IN WITHOUT IT SINKING,SMLER  NO D THE BIGER BE EASIEROURPNASN WITHIN
2674,IF YOU PUT THEM IN THE MIDDLE THEY'LL BE ABLE TO HAVE MORE SINCE IT'S BALANCED AND IF YOU PUT THEM KINDA EVERYWHERE IT'LL SINK FASTER,YOU PUT THM IN THE MADOL WILL BEABLL HAVE MOU SSPAONSYOU PUT OM EVERY WSIN FASTER

2686,THAT THE DIFFERENCE IF THEY'RE WIDER OR TALLER THEY'LL WILL HOLD MORE WATER AND MORE PENNIES,THE RONS IS TA A WILL HOLD MY WATER IN S
2687,THE ONE THAT'S UNDER WATER HAS TOO MANY PENNIES BECAUSE THEY'RE ALL PILED UP AND THEY'RE SPREAD OUT BUT THE ONE UM THAT'S STILL ABOVE IS EVEN AND IT'LL BE EASIER,THN THEUNDER WATER HAS TOOMNEY PNY PS RED  EVEASIER

3856,UM A MEASUREMENT STANDARD IS WHEN YOU JUST USE ONE SIZE ONLY TO MEASURE SOMETHING LIKE INCHES THEY'RE ALL THE SAME SIZE NO MATTER WHAT CENTIMETERS THEY'RE ALL THE SAME SIZE NO MATTER WHAT,TIS REALY TO EASE ONE SIS ONLY TOMEADO OMTHINGA THE ERTHE SAME SIG SEVEET THE SAME SIE
3857,IT IS GOING REALLY GOOD,I IS GOWING RALY D
3858,IF YOU USE INCHES YOU'RE GONNA HAVE A DIFFERENT AMOUNT OF INCHES THAN YOU ARE THAN CENTIMETERS SO IF YOU USE LIKE INCHES AND CENTIMETERS THEN YOU CAN HAVE A DIFFERENT AMOUNT OF INCHES THAN CENTIMETERS,A TH EA SEVENMATOS R L SSATEVA MATO
3859,UM IT'S IMPORTANT SO UM LIKE A LIKE A BIG DISTANCE YOU WANNA USE YOU WANNA USE A BIG THING TO MEASURE IT SO SO STUFF LIKE THAT IS REALLY GOOD,SLK A BIG ST   BIGRTHLY GOOD
3860,I HAVE BEEN STUDYING MEASUREMENT,I HVE STARLY MESERMONT
3861,WELL IF YOU USE CENTIMETERS IT'S GONNA BE IT'S GONNA BE A LOT SMALLER THAN IT'S GONNA BE WITH LIKE STRAWS BECAUSE S MOST STRAWS ARE BIGGER THAN CENTIMETERS,W SANT CCANBT CAN B ITS TRS ARE BIGTR

3876,WE HAVE BEEN UM MEASURING THE MASS OF STUFF,WE'V HA  MSERYING THE A SIL
3877,WELL THE DRY SPONGE OR THE WET SPONGE SO THE THE WATER THE WATER IS WHAT MAKES IS WHAT MAKES THE WET SPONGE HEAVIER SO THAT'S WHY WHAT I JUST TOLD YOU WORKS,THE DRICE PUSON THE THWATER ATER IMAK H  MVERTHATS WY JUST D W ARK
3878,YOU UM YOU USE GRA YOU PUT GRAMS IN THE OTHER SIDE YOU PUT GRAMS IN THE OTHER SIDE TO FIGURE OUT HOW HEAVY THE SPONGE IS,OUPAMS IN THE OTHER SIDBUTGRAMS ON THE OTHER SIDE
3879,YOU DON'T WANT TO MEASURE TOO HEAVY THINGS OR ELSE I CA OR ELSE YOU CAN'T PUT ENOUGH GRAMS IN ONE SIDE AND YOU WON'T AND IT WILL BE LIKE EXTRA HEAVY,YOU DON'T Z T HEVRYOU CAN PUTRAMS IN ONE SIDE OURA BE LK IXEV
3880,UM WELL YOU HAVE THE DRY SPONGE OR THE WET SPONGE SO THE WET SPONGE YOU MINUS THE YOU MINUS THE GRAMS OF THE WET SPONGE AND WHEN YOU MINUS THE GRAMS OF THE DRY SPONGE TO THE WET SPONGE,WE HAVE A REMM T GRAMS  THOTH RAMP  E PU TTHE
3881,WELL WHEN I LOOKED THROUGH IT I FIGURED OUT THAT THE WET SPONGE IS HEAVIER AND IT IS SIXTEEN GRAMS,ALMEN LOOK THR UDO THE WET SPUE HEVIERIS SIX TEN GRAMTS
3882,WELL I OBSERVED THAT THERE IS THREE GRAMS IN ONE CUP AND THEN THERE'S THE SPONGE AND THE LI AND THE TWO LINES MATCH UP ON THE BALANCE SO THAT MEANS THAT THE SPONGE IS THREE GRAMS,I BZERVE  ERIS THREE GRAMS IN ON CUPE THE TWO LIMES VPSR THATMS  UTHREE GRAMS
3883,A SOAKED SPONGE WILL BE BIGGER A LOT HEAVIER BECAUSE IT'S FULL WITH WATER AND YEAH,WILL BE BIGO ACA FOR WITH WATER
3884,IT IS GOING GOOD,GOWN
3885,GOODBYE,GBY
3886,UM I DO WHAT I JUST DID BUT WITH A WET SPONGE,I T RE JUST STARED WIT  ET SPUNS
3887,THE DRY ONE WILL BE THE LEAST HEAVIEST THE WET ONE WILL BE HEAVIER AND BIGGER AND THE SOAKED WILL BE THE BIGGEST AND THE HEAVIEST,THE DRW WN WILL BE THE LIT EWHIT  I E IRB THE BIGT
3888,UM THE WET SPONGE WAS HEAVIER THAN THE DRY SPONGE,THE EABU IS HEVYER THON THE DRICE BU
3889,WE FIND OUT THAT UM THE DRY SPONGE IS NOT VERY BIG UM AND IT DOESN'T LOOK TOO HEAVY,OTHE RICE TUN IS NOT VERY BIG DOSN'T LK TOO HEVY
3890,UM WELL WE USED A BALANCE TO FIGURE IT OUT AND UM WITH GRAMS WE WOULD TRY TO EVEN EVERYTHING OUT,ALLU UWITH RAUM WE WILD TRY TO EATEVRY THING ELS
3891,WELL THE SPONGE IN THE MIDDLE WOULD BE LITTLE LESS HEAVIER THAN THE SOAKED CAUSE IT WON'T BE SOAKED ALL THE WAY AND AND IT'LL BE BIG BIGGER AND HEAVIER THAN THE DRY,THE WILL B A L  HEVYER N SIRCUCS IT WOT E CED  AYILL BE BIG BIGERN HEVER RY
3892,UM UH WHAT IS GOING ON IS THERE'S THIS SPONGE THIS SPONGE IS HEAVIER THAN THE THAN THE EMPTY CUP SO SO THE CUP WITH THE SPONGE IS GOING IS UM TIPPING OVER,ALBAG SUE SPUNIS HEVYRT O TH EMTY OO W SPUN
3893,THE WA THE THING IS UM THE THING IN THE RIGHT CUP IS A LOT HEAVIER THAN THE AIR,IS HE SNG IN THE RIE COP IS LOT HEVRIN THE AIR
3894,I NOTICED THAT THE SPONGE IS EXACTLY THREE GRAMS IN THIS PICTURE,I NOTEST THE THE PU EZACKTLY THREE GRAMS IN THIS PICTURE
3895,YOU WERE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW HEAVY HOW HEAVY EACH OBJECT WAS,WE  AING H INGER OUT HO   ET S
3896,YOU CAN USE YOUR BALANCE LIKE TO FIGURE OUT HOW HEAVY FOR EXAMPLE YOU CAN FIGURE OUT HOW HEAVY A PIECE OF A CU A GOLD COIN IS OR MONEY,YOU CAN YAUSE YOUR MALLYOMS LIKES T RAMPLDOEY
3897,UM WELL YOU CAN MEASURE,WI YOU M
3898,IT TELLS ME THAT UM YOU WOULD JUST BASICALLY UM ONE GRAM IS LIKE HALF OF A GRAM A KILOGRAM IS HALF OF A GRAM,TOLDS ME THE WILL JUST ACLEAR WONEGRAM IIKE AH CALL GRAME
3899,SO UM I DON'T KNOW,S O DON'T MEL
3900,I FOUND OUT THAT THE SHOE WAS ONE THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED GRAMS,I UTHE SHO S ONE BR I ON O R
3901,I FIGURED OUT THAT THE ORANGE WAS THREE HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE GRAMS,FHE A AS THREE HONDERED TWENTY FIVE CRANDS
3902,YOU COULDN'T DO IT BECAUSE THERE'S NOT ENOUGH GRAM PIECES,YOU DIT BECAUSE THERIS NOT ANOF AMPETE
3903,YOU COULD UM GET YOU COULD MAKE UM ONE HUNDRED GRAM GRAM PIECE AND THEN YOU COULD PUT THAT IN AND SEE WHAT HOW IT WAS GOING THEN,OU YOU CAN MAKE WONE HONDRD RAMPESTTHEA THE AAT
3904,WE WERE SEEING LIKE HOW MANY GRAM BLOCKS IT TOOK TO LIKE WEIGH A PENCIL A GLUE STICK A SCISSORS A RULER AND A THERMOMETER,ING T O AN OK  S RLLERAAA
3905,YOU UM SO YOU I CAN'T TELL ANYMORE I KIND OF SAID IT ALL,BEHIND  LA
3906,ONE THOUSAND,THOUSAND
3907,YOU WOULD USE IT WHEN THERE LIKE WHEN IT'S BIGGER WHEN SOMETHING WEIGHS MORE THAN ONE THOUSAND,WL  BSOMTHING LASE MOUR THAN ONE THOUSAND
3908,I NOTICED THAT THERE ARE FIVE TWENTIES WHICH EQUAL ONE HUNDRED AND THEN THERE'S GRAVEL ON THE OTHER SIDE SO THE GRAVEL MUST BE ONE HUNDRED GRAMS,NOTSTFIVE TWETYE EACL ON NDRED AVE ON THE OTHER SIDE THE RVEL MOST BE ON ONDRED RAND
3909,IT TELLS ME THAT THE METAL DISK IS EIGHT GRAMS,I TOLLS ME TH THE MEDO USTIS EIGHT GRANDS
3910,GRAMS ARE THE UM METRIC SYSTEM OF WEIGHT OF WEIGHT AND MASS I THINK,SCANE THEAERI STAMSO OASTI THINK
3911,I OBSERVED THAT THERE IS UM I DON'T SEE I DON'T REALLY OBSERVE ANYTHING,I OUB ZURE   I DON'T SE  DON'T ALAZARVE THIN
3912,YOU CAN F YOU I DON'T KNOW,YOU CAN ICE MEL
3913,YOU WOULD GET A REALLY ACCURATE UM ANSWER,YOU COULD GET A REALLY OCUROTE MANRE
3914,UM TWO OF THE TWO OF THE FIVE GRAMS IT EQUALS A TEN GRAM AND THEN AFTER YOU HAVE TWO TEN GRAMS IT EQUALS A TWENTY GRAM,WEN YOU HAVE BLU BEL GROMD TEA FIVE RANS
3915,TO USE YOU WOULD NEED TO USE THE SAME IF YOU WERE MEASURING A PENCIL YOU WOULD NEED TO USE THE SAME PENCIL AND UM AND YOU WOULD NEED TO USE GRAMS,E US THE SAME RM U THE SAME PA  GRANTS
3916,YOU WOULD YOU WOULD UM D DO YOU WOULD DO UM LIKE YOU WOULD MEASURE S YOU WOULD WEIGH IT WITH SOMETHING THAT'S A THOUSAND GRAMS OR MORE,W L D LIKE I ATOR WIL AWITH SOMTHING A THOUSAND A MOROW
3917,I NOTICED THAT THAT UM I DON'T THAT MAYBE THAT THERE IS TEN KILOGRAMS IN ONE GRAM,I NOTIS MABE HTHE TEN CALLI GRAUMS IN ONE GRA
3918,I'M GOOD THANK YOU,I'M GOOD THAK
3919,WHEN YOU WEIGH AN APPLE OR AN ORANGE UM YOU WOULD NEED A LOT MORE LIKE MATERIALS THAT YOU CAN MEASURE AND ACTUALLY GET IT BALANCED,EN    WL MEAT AKMATERIALE OU CA MES IN BALLT
3920,THE CAR IN THE PICTURE WEIGHS SEVENTY GRAMS,THE CAR IN THE PICTURE WAED SEVEN E GRAUNTS
3921,YOU COULD USE IT AS A REFERENCE BECAUSE IF YOU HAD A NICKEL YOU COULD KNOW YOU CAN LIKE IF YOU HAD A LOT OF NICKELS YOU COULD PUT EM IN A CUP AND THEN MEASURE IT LIKE THAT,YOU CLD U INS BECAUS OU  M U YOU HAD A IC PINA MESRK THAT
3922,A KILOGRAM IS LESS THAN A GRAM YOU USE IT WHEN SOMETHING'S LESS THAN A GRAM,THE TELLEGRAME IS LESTHN SOM THINGS EAM
3923,UM I WOULD DESCRIBE EM THAT IT WOULD GO DOWN REALLY FAR AND THEN IT STARTED TO GO UP UP UP,BTH GO OUN REALLY SAR NTHNT STARTED
3924,THAT UM IN TEN MINUTES IT DROPPED ALL THE WAY TO IT DROPPED A THE WAY TO TEN,IN TEN MINEITS I DROP  WUPTTHEATUM
3925,I DISCOVERED THAT IT GOT MUCH COLDER,AR DESCVERIT MCH COLDER

4005,THAT OBJECT IS A SYRINGE AND IT HAS FORTY MILLILITERS OF WATER,THEA OBJECT  SNAS TORLEADER ATER
4006,I REALIZED THAT THE CUP WAS FILLED WITH ONE HUNDRED FORTY TWO MILLILITERS,I REALLIZSE TTHE WAS FIELD WITH ONE ONDERED FOURTYE TWO
4007,SYRINGE WE USED UM COULD GO UP TO YOU COULD GET IT UP TO FIFTY AND THEN IT WOULD STOP SO YEAH,RN BTHE MC OU C ARTER UP TO FIFTY WI STAR
4008,IT'S WHEN YOU IT CAN'T HOLD ANYMORE WATER,IT CANT HOLD ENEY MOR WATER
4009,THEY'RE ALL TWO HUNDRED MILLILITER VESSELS,TH  TWO HNDERED MLEADER VESLES
4010,VOLUME IS UM THE STUFF VOLUME IS WHAT IS INSIDE OF A UM OF A UM OF A CONTAINER OR SOMETHING,HE VOLUME IS A THE THE VOLUME IS WAT IS IN SIDE OVE A  COMPAUTOER OR SOMTHING
4011,I NOTICE THAT IT HAS ONE HUNDRED MILLILITERS IT CAN HOLD ONE HUNDRED MILLILITERS,NTIS TH IT HAS ONE HODERED LEADEIT CAN HOLD ON HONDERED HELEADER
4012,CAPACITY IS UM AMOUNT IT CAN HOLD WHEN IT'S TO THE TIPPY TIP TOP LIKE YEAH,ITPASSY  TCAN HOLD WNT TO THE TIPYIPTOPIKE AT
4013,IT'S GOING WELL THANK YOU,I GOWING WALL THINKSYOU
4014,I DISCOVERED THAT DIFFERENT CONTAINERS HOLD DIFFERENT UM AMOUNT AND IF YOU HAVE A BIGGER CONTAINER YOU HAVE A BIGGER ANSWER AND YOU HAVE IF YOU HAVE A SMALLER CONTAINER YOU HAVE A SMALLER ANSWER,DISCUVERTOTO IN OO  A BIGRO S A BIGANERO  A SMOLE AVE A SMOLLEAER
4015,YESTERDAY WE SAW HOW MUCH A PLASTIC CUP HOW MANY UM HOW MANY MILLILITERS A PLASTIC CUP HAD UM LIKE WE USED YEAH,YESTERDAY WE SO MUCH PAS HM M LEADERS PAS  IN ET
4016,I NOTICED THAT UM AT THE CUP'S CAPACITY IT HAD ONE HUNDRED FORTY TWO MILLILITERS IN IT,NTTHE CAME PASSTHONE HN FOURTY TWO LEADERST
4017,I DO NOT KNOW,I D NOT E
4018,I DON'T KNOW,
4019,THAT TOOL IS A GRADUATED CYLINDER,THAT T IS A GRADOWATED IELONDER
4020,I LEARNED THAT IT DOESN'T REALLY MATTER WHAT SHAPE IT IS IF IT HOLDS THE SAME AMOUNT OF WATER,R I DOUESN'T REALLY MATERS WI SH HOLDS THE SAME AMOUNT  ATER
4021,YOU WOULD MEASURE THINGS THAT ARE SMALLER THAN A LITER AND THAT ARE BIGGER THAN ONE MILLILITER,YOU WIL THINKS   SMLL  THE LEADER THA BAGER N NE LEADER
4022,WHEN YOU HAVE AN EMPTY CUP YOU CAN USE IT FOR UM PUTTING IN IN THE BALANCE OR BASICALLY ANYTHING,YOU HAVE AN EMPTY CUPYOU C U FOPUTING IN THE BALUNTS R VITHING
4023,IT MAKES THEM GOOD CAUSE YOU CAN SUCK UP A PREC VERY PRECISE AMOUNT OF WATER,ITMAKS M GOOD CS YOU CK A  VERY PSIE  MOT WATER
4024,YOU CAN USE A VIAL,YOU CAN LAUSE  VI
4025,THESE TOOLS ARE USEFUL BECAUSE YOU CAN GO FROM SO YOU CAN I DON'T REALLY KNOW,EASE JES ARE BUTIFUL BC YOU CAN GO S RLY
4026,UM THEY I DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY REPRESENT,THDON'T NO W TA REPRESENTS
4027,IT'S A LITER,LEADER
4028,GOOD,GOOD
4029,IT WOULD TELL YOU HOW BIG OR SMALL THE CUP IS,O O BLP
4030,I NOTICED THAT THE FIRST VIAL IS MUCH BIGGER THAN THE SECOND VIAL,NTHE FT E IS MUCH BIGER THN THE SAND FIRE
4031,A LITER CAN BE BROKEN DOWN INTO MILLILITERS,THE LEADER CAN BE BROAN DOWTTHELEADER
4032,UM WE USED UM VIALS B AND I DON'T REALLY KNOW,WILL YOU VES BE RY
4033,YOU WOULD UM THERE'S NUMBERS ON THE SIDE AND YOU WOULD SEE HOW MANY MMM UM SOME I DON'T KNOW,YOU WITHAR UMBER  ON T SIDE AND YO  SE H MY TNO
4034,THE PLASTIC CUP,THE LASTRCOP
4035,I NOTICED THAT BOTH OF THE CUPS HAVE UM MMM ONE HUNDRED MILLILITERS ON THEM,I TS TH B THE CAS N RED LEADERS
4036,YOU WOULDN'T GET A VERY GOOD AN ANSWER BECAUSE THEY'RE DIFFERENT SIZE AND IT'S NOT A VERY GOOD WAY TO MEASURE LIQUID,YO ULDN'T GET A VERY OOD A BECAS THE JFRINSIDES  IS NOT A Y GOOD IC
4037,YOU WOULD FILL THE CUP WITH WATER AND THEN YOU WOULD TA YOU TAKE A,YOU WILL FILL THE COUP WITH WATER IN T WILL TAKE A
4038,I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE METRIC UNITS ARE FOR MEASURING VOLUME,I DO'T THE AOTTERNG VOLUME
4039,IT'S A SYRINGE WITH UM WATER IN IT,A SIRIN WITH WATER
4040,I DO NOT KNOW THAT,I OT
4041,TEN OF THEM MAKE UP A LITER,TENM LEADER
4042,ERE ARE ONE THOUSAND ONE THOUSAND MILLILITERS IN A LITER,S ON THOUSND  LEADERS IN A LEADER
4043,THERE ARE ONE THOUSAND MILLILITERS IN A LITER,AR ONE THOUSAND LEADR I E LEADER
4044,S TELLING ME THAT YOU MILLILITERS ARE LESS THAN A LITER,TELLSING ME THT  ELEADER  ES THAN THE LEADER
4045,I FORGET,IERET
4046,MILLILITERS ARE LESS THAN A LITER SO THAT YOU CAN UM MEASURE THE VOLUME OF SOMETHING LESS THAN A LITER,LEADERIS LEADER NMTER THE VOLUME IS SOMTHING LES THN THE LEADER
4047,YOU WOULD NEED TO UM WEIGH THEM AND LIKE WEIGH THEM AND THEN PUT THEM ON ON AND THEN PUT THEM IN ORDER FROM HEAVIEST TO LIGHTEST,W MEME T AE  I REAIPUTM N PUT THEM IN ORDER FROM HAVYUST TLAT
4048,IT'S THAT THE LIKE GRAY LINE A ADDS UP WITH THE LIKE ELEVATED BLUE SPACE,A GRAY BIMED ZOR WIH THE A ELEVATED BLUE SACE
4049,THAT PICTURE IS OF A LITTLE IS OF A CUBE THAT IS ONE GRAM,THAT PICTUR IS    O ACUTE  OEGRAMD
4050,I FORGET AND I DON'T KNOW,I TVE
4051,THE THEY'RE THE THEY PUT THE UM METAL CHIP IN ONE SIDE OF THE UM SCALE AND THEN THEY'RE PUTTING GRAMS IN TO SEE HOW MUCH IT WEIGHS,THEY PUT THE MATE SHIP IN ONE SIDE THE UMED EPUTIN GRAMS TO SE H H E AE
4052,BECAUSE THEN YOU'LL GET A MUCH MORE ACCURATE ANSWER THAN WITH YOUR HANDS,BECAUSE THEN YOLL GET MUCH MOURAT THN WITH YOUR HANDS
4053,YOU COULD DO IT BY IF YOU IF YOU WERE JUST ESTIMATING YOU COULD LIKE I WHAT I WROTE IS I THOUGHT THE HEAVIEST WAS THE UM METAL AND THEN THE PLASTIC AND THEN THE WOOD,U BIF YO WR JUST ESTMATING OU  R TO THE HEVYOUST WIH THMEPASTE
4054,IT'S THAT UM THE MATERIALS WEIGH MORE AND THAT WHEN SOME MATERIALS WEIGH MORE THAN OTHER MATERIALS,THE MATERIALE A OTSOME MATERIALE AMOR THEN OTHER MATERIALE
4055,UM YOU ARE USING A SCALE TO MEASURE TO MEASURE THE WEIGHT OF THE PLASTIC DISK,U ARE YOUSING SCL TOMAS T MASERE THE  TAS
4056,THE UM,S
4057,YOU WOULD MEASURE THE WEIGHTS OF THINGS,WHO WILL MESURE THE ASTAS
4058,I DON'T KNOW,ASOU DON'T M
4059,YOU WOULD NEED TO,OU W  SON
4060,I FOR I DON'T KNOW,O SDOT A
4061,WE USED PAPER CLIPS,WILL YOUS PAPERIFTS
4062,IT WOULD AFFECT BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW,ET BECAUSE I DNOW
4063,UM IT WAS ONE GRAM,AS OE GRA
4064,I DON'T KNOW,BNORMAL
4065,IT WAS EIGHT GRAMS THE LITTLE THE METAL DISK WAS EIGHT GRAMS,AS EIGHT GAM THE E THE MEDOW TWAS  GRAUMNTS
4066,I DO NOT KNOW,NOTOE
4067,UM GRAMS ARE UM WHAT LIKE THE METRIC SY GRAMS ARE THE METRIC SYSTEM ARE IN THE METRIC SYSTEM,MRA LIKE TEAGRAMZAR THMAITHE  SISTAME
4068,THEN WE USED GRAMS TO ACTU TO FIGURE OUT THE REAL ANSWER,SALUSED GRAM T TO FIGER THE REL ANA
4069,THE WEIGHT AND THE MASS IS THAT IT IS EIGHT GRAMS,THEMAHS  I EIG GRAS
4070,IT'S NOT A GOOD TECHNIQUE BECAUSE UM MISS OUR TEACHER GAVE US TWO DIFFERENT KINDS OF PAPER CLIPS SO WE ALL WE GOT DIFFERENT ANSWERS,UMEY BEAS AR TEAH   TWO DIFRN APERWE UT FRNT ANSERES
4071,PAPER CLIPS,APERLETS
4072,I THINK IT'S THE MATERIAL THAT MAKES THEM DIFFERENT AMOUNTS,I GET THE MAERIALE THAT MAKS OM DIFRNT AMONTS
4073,YOU UH I DON'T KNOW I THINK,DOT I
4074,IT MEANS THAT IT IS EIGHT GRAMS,E IN STARTED  E GA
4075,I DISCOVERED THAT OUR PAPER CLIPS WEIGHED ONE GRAM,DISVERED THAR ABER S W ONE GA
4076,I FORGET,IRET
4077,ON C THE TEMPERATURE IS TWENTY DEGREES,UN SNG THE TEMPATUR IS TWENTY DEGREE
4078,IT WORKS BETTER BECAUSE THEN YOU GET THE ACCURATE THE CORRECT ANSWER AND YEAH,IT LIKES BUTER BECAUS THE  THATHE CRECT AERE
4079,YOU USE A THERMOMETER TO MEASURE THE TEMPERATURE OF SOMETHING,HEUSMOMENT MASERED THE TEMPAERE OSOMTHING
4080,I DO NOT KNOW,I DUNOT NOEW
4081,IT MEASURES,MTHING
4082,UM THERE IS NO MORE I CAN SAY,T IS NOB O SAVE
4083,I DO NOT KNOW THAT,DOS NOT ELL E
4084,I THINK HE IS TRYING TO FIGURE OUT W UM WHICH ONE IS HOTTEST WHICH ONE IS COLDEST AND WHICH ONE IS IN BETWEEN,I THINK HE IS TRYN TO FE CH  IS BETWEEN
4085,YESTERDAY WE USED OUR FINGERS TO SEE UM IF CUP A CUP B OR CUP C'S W WATER WAS WARMER,YESTDAY LATHED AR FINGERS TO S A CUT THE AWATERARM
4086,SO THAT EVERYBODY CAN KNOW LIKE HAVE A STANDARD THING FOR LIKE ROOM TEMPERATURE AND LIKE WHEN YOU DON'T GO OUTSIDE AND STUFF LIKE THAT,SREVERY BODY CA A STA  THE GRUM TEMPEERL WHEN YOU DON'T GO ISIE IS LIKE THAT
4087,WE ESTIMATED WITH OUR FINGER,WE ESTMATE WITH AR NGERE
4088,YOU CAN SENSE THE DIFFERENT TEMPERATURES OF THE WATER,YOU CAN SE THE DIFRNT TEMPETUR  TWATER
4089,UM I DO NOT KNOW,DOUS NOT NOW
4090,GOOD,GOOD
4091,I DO NOT KNOW THAT,NOT MLA
4092,IT TELLS YOU THAT IT'S MUCH MUCH COLDER,TELLS YOU T MUCH MUH OLDER
4093,WE USED A THERMOMETER TO SEE THE TEMPERATURE IN THE WATER,WBE UTED AMOUMAD TO SES THE TEMPETUR IN THE WATER
4094,I THINK ABOUT IS IT HOT COLD OR JUST WARM,I THINK HCOLD AJUT WARMTH
4095,SO THAT YOU CAN ALL KNOW THE EXACT TEMPERATURE OF THE WATER AND NOBODY WILL GET CONFUSED IN BETWEEN WHICH ONE IS WARMER AND WHICH ONE IS COLDER,SO THAT YOU CAN OLL MELL THE AZACT TEMPETURE O THE WATERNOBE WILL COMFUSET IN BETWEEN HAHLD
4096,WE WERE SEEING HA WHICH CUP WAS WARMER AND WE FIGURED OUT THAT THE B CUP WAS THE COLDEST BUT A AND C WERE THE SAME TEMPERATURE,WE WLL YOU C H WARMANWE FGERDBUPA AN S  THE SAME TEMPATURE
4097,IT'S WHEN IT'S HOT WHEN IT GOES UP AND IT'S COLD WHEN IT'S GO DOW WHEN IT GOES DOWN,ARGROWS COLD WHENITOS OWN
4098,YOU U WE'RE USING CELSIUS IN THIS UNIT,WILL YOU SING SALIN THA
4099,UM WE WE I FOUND OUT THAT THE IT WENT IN BETWEEN FIFTY AND TEN WHICH IS THIRTY AND YEAH,ON IN BETWEEN FIFTY  TEN CHIS THRTY  YEARD
4100,WE'RE MIXING THE ICE AND THE CO AND THE HOT WATER TOGETHER AND WE'RE GONNA GET A NEW TEMPERATURE OF WATER,MSING THE ICE NTH WATER TO GATHER IN M NEW MTR WATER
4101,WE PUT A THERMOMETER IN,WE PUT A SOMERIN
4102,YOU USE GRAMS,ZZRGRANTS
4103,I FOUND OUT THAT THE DRY SPONGE WAS THREE GRAMS AND THAT BUT THAT IT WAS THREE GRAMS,I THOUGHT I HOUGHT THE DRIE SPUNWAS THREE GRAUMS
4104,I FORGET AND I DON'T KNOW,I'M READY FOR GET
4105,A SOAKED SPONGE UM I DON'T KNOW,WILL CEAR SPOON O OMA
4106,I KNOW THAT IF YOU UM PUT A DRY SPONGE IN WATER THAT IT WILL LIKE Z ABSORB AND GET MUCH BIGGER,NOF YO PUT A DRICE PNS IN WATERABZARNGET MUCH BICKER
4107,UM THE S I OBSERVED THAT THE SPONGE THE DRY SPONGE SOAKED UP UM THIRTEEN GRAMS OF WATER,I SR SPUN THE ICE UHE THREE GAM  WATER
4108,UM I DON'T REALLY KNOW ANYMORE,DN'T REALLY NO ENY MOR
4109,THE SPONGE IN THE MIDDLE IS WET AND IT DOESN'T HAVE AS MUCH WATER IN IT AS THE SOAKED SPONGE,THE PSINTHEMATO IS IT DOESN'T HAVE AS MUCH  WATER I
4110,I NOTICED THAT THE DRY SPONGE EQUALS THREE GRAMS,I NOTS HE  THREE ANTS
4111,YOU UM WHEN YOU DON'T YOU WOULD COUNT YOU COUNT THE GRAMS AND THE CUP WITHOUT THE SPONGE IN IT,EW OU OT GRAIN THE CAUB WI A AN
4112,I NOTICED THAT UM THAT THEY WERE BALANCED AND THE WHITE THING WAS IN LINE WITH THE BLUE UM LINE,I NOTED SBALIONS IN THE IT N AS IN INE WITH THE BLUE I
4113,YOU CAN SEE HOW MUCH WATER THE SPONGE SOAKED UP BY UM DOING THE ANSWER YOU GOT MINUS THE WEIGHT OF THE DRY SPONGE,YOU CAN SEVE HO MUCH WATER THE P UING THE ANTER YOU UGT Y ET TH WAT  THE DRY SPOONS
4114,IT'S GOING GOOD THANK YOU,G
4115,WE WERE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW MUCH THEY WEIGHED,WE W TRYIN TO THINK OUT HO MUCH THE
4116,SO THESE OBJECTS THERE'S A DRY SPONGE A WET S SPONGE AND A SOAKED SPONGE AND THE DRY SPONGE IS THE LIGHTEST THEN THE WET SPONGE THEN THE SOAKED SPONGE IS THE HEAVIEST,BCT R A RSPU THE R THE LAS    PUE HEVT
4117,UM A WET SPONGE IS UM SOFT IS SQUISHIER AND UM IT FEELS SOFTER AND YEAH,UNH WET SPNS OFT THE SCASERD ELLS SOFTERN
4118,WHEN YOU HAVE A BALANCE AND A SPONGE YOU CAN UM PUT THE SPONGE IN ONE SIDE AND PUT GRAM PIECES ON THE OTHER SIDE TO SEE HOW MUCH IT WEIGHS,WHEN YOU HAS A BALUNCS IN SPUOU PUTTHE SPUSION INSIDRAMPEES ON THE THERSIDE T E
4119,I FOUND OUT THAT THE DRY SPONGE WHEN IT WHEN IT'S SOAKED ABSORBED LIKE UM LIKE TEN TIMES ITS OWN WEIGHT,I  THTR  PONS WEN T S OR TTEN TI E
4120,IT'S WHEN IT STOPS ABSORBING WATER,I WEN IT STOPS ABZORING WATER
4121,YOU CAN USE A BALANCE TO MEASURE THE WEIGHT AND THE MASS OF SOMETHING,OU CAN YUSE BALIONCE TO ZR THE WT IN AS SOMTHING
4122,I FIGURED OUT THAT THE WET SPONGE WAS SIXTEEN GRAMS,I FIGERE HE WT U WITH SIX TEEN CRANDS
4123,I DO NOT KNOW,I DNOT NOW
4124,I FORGET,IFRET
4125,T,
4126,YOU WOULD NEED TO THINK ABOUT HOW LONG IS YOUR HAND OR YOUR FINGER AND THEN YOU CAN MEASURE IT,OL ME T THINK ABOUT HALONG IS YOUR HA YOU RT
4127,YOU WOULD USE CENTIMETERS,H WILL YEAS SMMATOR
4128,IT TELLS YOU THAT IT'S ONE CENTIMETER WIDE,TELLS YOU ARW
4129,YOU USE MILLIMETERS WHEN SOMETHING IS SMALLER THAN A CENTIMETER,ATO WIG  SOR MATER
4130,AND GENERALLY USUALLY UM TWO THINGS ARE LIKE THE SAME HEIGHTH,TWO THINGS AIR LIKE THE SAME A
4131,THAT THE BIGGEST LIKE THING WITH CENTIMETERS ON IT IS A METER THEN IT GOES TO THE DECAMETER THEN A CENTIMETER THEN A ME MILLIMETER,THE BIL SING WIT EMATORS MAMATORS N A SEVNMAORR
4132,I SEE THAT HER NOSE AND HER EAR ARE THE SAME LENGTH,I SE THER NOTS IN YOUR ARS AR THE SAME LAN
4133,TO CHECK YOUR ANSWER SO YOU CAN MAKE SURE YOU GOT IT RIGHT,YOUR AASOU MA SURE OU
4134,CENTIMETERS,SEVMATER
4135,BECAUSE UM A METER STICK IS MORE IS LIKE YOU CAN HAVE A MORE ACCURATE ANSWER THAN IF YOU USED YOUR HAND,BECAUSE THE MEATER STIK IS MO L YOU CAN HAVE A MORRAT TER THEN YO LSE YOUR HANDS
4136,UM IT'S A I FOR I DON'T KNOW,I'M FORNOW
4137,I FORGET,IERGET
4138,I MEASURED MY FOOT AND THE DISTANCE AROUND MY WRIST I THINK IT WAS COOL BECAUSE IT W UM BECAUSE I IT WAS JUST VERY COOL,N THE DISTIOMSARON MY I THINKIT WAS CREL BECAUSE BECAS M T WAS JUST VEY
4139,BUT MY ARM SPAN AND MY HEIGHTH,MY EARMT SPATOY ETE
4140,I MEASURED FROM MY WRIST TO MY ELBOW,MARED FROM ITTMY ELBA
4141,I DON'T KNOW,NORMAL
4142,YOU USE A RULER OR A METER STICK OR LIKE SOMETHING LIKE THAT,ROLLER  MATER STICKE  SOM THING LIKE THAT
4143,YOU WOULD UM HAVE TO MEASURE IT SO YOU WOULD GET THE RIGHT ANSWER AND BE SURE YOU KNOW HOW LIKE TALL YOU ARE LIKE MEASURING THE HEIGHTH,WA TMEZ   SERE AN BE SURE  K ARA
4144,YOU WOU YOU COULD STILL USE A METER STICK BUT YOU WOULD USE THE CENTIMETERS ON IT,YOU CAN STIELL US MEATER STICK B RD  NMATE
4145,YOU HAVE TO BEGIN AT A CORNER AND END AT A KIND OF CORNER OTHERWISE YOU WON'T REALLY HAVE A QUITE ACCURATE MEASUREMENT,YOU HAVE B TN A CORRTHTHEWS Y 'T REALLY HAVE RESERMONDT
4146,I FORGET I THINK,I A A THINKS
4147,WHEN I FIGURED OUT HOW LONG NO TALL MY EAR WAS IT WAS REALLY COOL BECAUSE IT WAS THE SAME LENGTH AS MY NOSE,WHEN Y FIGRTMY EARWS  REALLY R BECAS AS THE SAME LEN AS Y OS
4148,I DON'T KNOW,L
4149,THE PERSON IS MEASURING HIS PINKIE AND FINDING OUT THAT IT IS ONE CENTIMETER WIDE,THEPERSON I MASERING  PINKY N FINDING OUT THS ONE TEVEMADORE
4150,YOU USE CENTIMETERS TO MEASURE WHEN SOMETHING'S NOT AS LONG AS A METER SO YOU CAN FIND THE RIGHT ANSWER,EVENMATOS TOMESRE WONSMETHINGS OT S LONG  YOU CANITH RAANCERE
4151,L IT FITS IN BECAUSE IF YOU KNOW HOW WIDE YOUR PINKIE IS THEN YOU CAN TELL LIKE OBJECTS WITH YOUR PINKIE SO YOU KNOW HOW UM WIDE OR TALL THEY ARE,BAS YOU NO   TENTT OBJECTS WITH YOUR PEAAR
4152,YOU WOULD USE EM WHEN THERE'S FOR THE MILLIMETERS YOU WOULDN'T USE IT WHEN IT THEN WHEN IT'S SMALLER THAN A CENTIMETER AND YOU WOULD USE CENTIMETERS WHEN IT'S SMALLER THAN A DECAMETER,WILL LOMATOR HE WILL  SELMATER  SEVENMATRS SMEL   MATOR
4153,UM I DON'T KNOW,NO
4154,UM YOU WOULD YOU MEASURED IT TWICE BECAUSE IF YOU'RE LIKE METER IF YOU HAD A ME METER MEASURING UM TAPE THEN IT WILL KIND OF GO LIKE,T WILL BE VERY  PLSR YOU TLY ASIE ANCERE
4155,YEAH,YEW
4156,YOU COULD USE A RULER AND THEN LIKE EVERY RULE MOST RULERS ARE THE SAME SIZE SO YOU WOULD GET A MORE ACCURATE ANSWER,WHCEVERY MOST LLERS ARE THE SAME SIS SW ET A  ABCURT ANRE
4157,IT WAS ABOUT UM TO SEE HOW UM HOW LONG IT HOW WIDE IT WAS AND HOW LONG IT WAS,THAT WAS ABOUT RM TO SE HO WHIY DINT ESION LONG
4158,LOT OF SENSE,
4159,LENGTH IS LIKE ABOUT LIKE THE UM I'M I FORGET WHAT LENGTH'S ALL ABOUT,THE S LA ABOT IK I FR ET WN ALL BOUT

4163,IT WORKED,WAR
4164,HI MY NAME IS NICKY AND I'M NINE,MONEY I SCKE  EINE
4165,YOU GOT UH A MUCH DIFFERENT ANSWER SO IT WOULD BE A REALLY BAD UM STRATEGY TO USE STRAWS,SITWILD BEA REALLY BAD  STTEDY  JOS
4166,HI,Y
4167,IT ISN'T A REAL GOOD UM STRATEGY BECAUSE UM THERE'S A LOT OF DIFFERENT SIZED STRAWS IN THE WORLD SO IT'S REALLY NOT A GOOD STRATEGY,REAL MSTBECASTHEARS A LO IFINS IHREALLY OA GOOD SY
4168,MARTY I HAVE TO GO,MRDHAFTO GO
4169,YEAH,YE
4170,UH WHEN YOU USE GROUP A'S AND FOR THE WIDTH IT ONLY TAKE FOUR STRAWS AND WHEN YOU USE GROUP B'S STRAWS IT TAKES UM I THINK TWELVE,WHEN YOU  CRUPATS  WITHONLY TAKS FOUR SOBA  S  THIN WA
4171,I USED A STRAW AND THEN I USED UM A MEASURING TAPE WITH UM CENTIMETERS ON IT,ARE YOUS  MASRING CA WITH EVEN MATERS
4172,YES,GEST
4173,I WOULD BE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW LONG THAT IS THE THING YOU ASKED ME TO MEASURE IS,WL BE TRYING TO FICER OUT H LON TTHE THING AME A
4174,BECAUSE IT'S LIKE A METER OR SOMETHING THING,BECAUSE I LAKE  MATIR SOMTHING
4175,A YARD STICK,LIHARSTIC
4176,UM WE THEN WE READ A BOOK IT WAS ABOUT HOW WE THINK FEET GOT TO BE,THEN WE RAD A BOOK
4177,YEAH I DID LEARN UH WE HAD LIKE THIS LONG THING WITH METER,T SNG WITH MEATOR
4178,NO WE JUST UH THE STRAWS WERE JUST UNEVEN,THE STAVES WARE JUST UN EAEND
4179,UM WE IMAGINED PICTURES LIKE IT A LIGHT WOULD BE LIKE A L KILOMETER UM WE IMAGINED THINGS THAT MIGHT BE A KILOMETER,WE MA PICTURES  BL A LATERMI ALLEVATOR

4182,RIGHT THERE UH HUH,T OSE
4183,THAT MEANS YOU WOULD START USING FEET UM OR CENTIMETERS OR ANY OTHER,THAT MAB START   F S
4184,WELL I LEARNED THAT UM PART OF IT IS A CENTIMETER,WILLRN THATMIN IS A SEVEN MEATOR
4185,LIKE THERE WOULD BE ONE STRAW THAT WAS THIS LONG AND THEN ANOTHER STRAW THAT WAS THIS LONG,G
4186,UM THE LEAST AMOUNT WOULD BE A METER,THELEEMOUNTB A MEATOR
4187,IT HAS A THOUSAND IN A MILLIMETER I MEAN WAIT A MILLIMETER THERE'S A THOUSAND M UM MILLIMETERS IN A METER,SOIN  AORA  SO I MELLMATOES IN A MEATOR

4240,WHAT,
4241,YOU WOULD PUT THE CONTAINER OF WATER IN ONE AND THEN IN THE OTHER ONE YOU'D PUT HOW MANY GRAMS OR IF Y WHAT MEASUREMENT YOU'RE USING,YO UL PUT THE TIN  WATER ONE NTIN THE OTHER ON OU PUT  RAM
4242,UM GRAMS,BRAYOUNTS
4243,UM WE HAD LIKE LITTLE BAGS AND WE PUT SAND IN THERE SO WE HA EACH GROUP HAD EACH TEAM HAD TWO BAGS AND THEN WE PUT THEM INTO A GIANT BAG AND,WEVE HAD L B WE PUT EAGROPTEM TWO BS TH AGON
4244,UM OH GRAMS,
4245,WE KNEW IT,
4246,WELL HMM,WA
4247,YES WE KNOW THAT UM IT'S A WET SPONGE BECAUSE OF THE SIZE THAT WOULD MEAN THAT THIS MUCH GRAMS EQUALS A WET SPONGE,PUNH BECAS THAT WILMIS UCH RAM EALE
4248,WELL THIS I WE KNOW THAT'S THAT'S A WET S SPONGE FROM LET'S SEE WHERE IS THAT PICTURE,WE NOTESD AA SPOOM FROM
4249,UH HI COOL,I TO
4250,UM WE DID MEASUREMENT TODAY UM,WILL YOU MESR S AM
4251,N MMM,
4252,UM SO WHAT WE DID FIRST WAS WE GOT LIKE EVERYTHING WE NEED AND LIKE THE BALANCE AND THE MASS PIECES UM MASS PIECES,BO K EVERY THING WE MEALIKE A BAST
4253,GRAMS EIGHTY THREE GRAMS,
4254,UM IT'S ABOUT H HOW MUCH YOU THINK IT IS THE CLOSEST YOU THINK IT WILL BE,ABOUT HO MUCH T THIN  CLOSWLBE
4255,YES BEFORE WE ME UM ESTIMATED THE WEIGHT OF THE SPONGE UM THE DRY SPONGE WE ESTIMATED,YE BEFOR WE MET  ESTMATED THA  SPU  THE DRS W ETMATED

4315,ESTIMATE,ETHM
4316,HI H HI BYE,
4317,WELL YOU COULD YOU LIKE POLE THAT'S KINDA LIKE THIS AND,YOU S AAULL ET
4318,UM IT WAS K UM METERS,IT WAS MATORS
4319,THANK YOU,YANKEE
4320,IT'S ALL ABOUT ONE GRAM ONE GRAM EQUALS JUST ABOUT ONE T P TINY PARTICLE OF EACH TW THING WE HAVE HERE,BRONE GRAMJUST BOUT ONEP TINEY ARTACLE O  THING WE HADE EARE
4321,WE MEASURED THEM AND FIND OUT HOW HEAVY THEY WERE AND IT WAS PRETTY COOL,WE MESURED THEM FIND OUT HO HV ARCLE
4322,THE THINGS ARE BEING PUT INSIDE THE BASK INT THE THINGS ARE BEING PUT INSIDE THE SCALE,THE THANS ARE BEING PUOT INSIDE THE THE FINGS ARE BEING PUOT INSIDE THE SCAE
4323,WE COULD PUT IT ON A SCALE,WE PUIT ON THE SCALL
4324,THE ONE ON THE RIGHT IS HEAVIER,THON O TH RA IS HEVYER
4325,TO FIND OUT HOW HEAVY THE METAL DISC IS,H  ATED I
4326,I COULD USE THEM TO PUT THE THINGS ON THE SCALE AND SEE HOW MUCH THEY WEIGH,PUTHE THINGS N CA  WA
4327,GOOD,GOOD
4328,WE'VE BEEN PRACTICING MEASUREMENT,WE'V BEN PRACTS  MESERMENT
4329,TO SEE WHAT MATERIAL THEY'RE MADE OF AND THEN WE'D BE ABLE TO FIND OUT HOW HEAVY THEY WOULD BE,TO SE WMTERIALE AR MAHEN WILL BE ABL TO FIND OUT HO HEVY THYB
4330,THEIR MASS IS HEAVIER SO THEY WEIGH MORE,THOUR MASWS HE EAW
4331,Y WE'RE TRYING TO SEE HOW MANY PAPER CLIPS WILL FIT INTO EACH CUP INTO THE CUPS TO MAKE IT EQUAL TO THE PLASTIC CHIP,WER TRYING TO SE HO MNEY PAPERIFS WILL FIT IN UTINT THE CU MAK  EACAL TO THE PLASTERHIP
4332,PAPER CLIP IS NOT EQUAL TO ONE GRAM ONE GRAM IS A LOT LIGHTER THAN A LARGE PAPER CLIP BECAUSE A PAPER CLIP ET WEIGH A LARGE PAPER CLIP WEIGHS MORE THAN ONE GRAM,EI NEAE  ONE RAM IS ALATER THN A LARH PAPERCHE LARG POPLE WT THRAMT
4333,BYE,FIVE
4334,A SCALE,SL
4335,TO SEE HOW MUCH THEY BOTH WEIGH,O SE HO MUCH THE THW
4336,WEIGHING THE PLASTIC DISC WAS ALL ABOUT ABOUT SEEING HOW MANY GRAMS IT WAS AND WHA AND HOW MU HOW HEAVY IT WOULD EQUAL,BAYING THE PLASTIRK TS I ALL ABOUTU SING HO MONEY CRAM I WS O HEVY W EACL
4337,THE WEIGHT IS HEAVIER AND SO IT IS JUST A LOT EASIER TO USE,THE VRAS IS HA THE AROND SOLLLY UCEASIER T U
4338,IT WILL HELP YOU KNOW THE EXACT SI THE EXACT WAY ABOUT IT AND IT'S VERY IMPORTANT,WILL HELP THTHEAWAABOUTA ITS VEARY EMPORTNT
4339,IS FIGURING OUT HOW HEAVY IT IS TO MAKE SURE THEY ARE CORRECT,I IING O SY TOMICTURE THE ABTRACT
4340,THEY ALL ARE MADE OF DIFFERENT ME MATERIALS SO THEY MAKE DIFFERENT SO THEY WEIGH DIFFERENT THINGS,THEY ALARAT MATERIALE SO TH MAKE TOTHE DFNTTANKS
4341,YES,ETH
4342,METAL IS HEAVIER THAN PLASTIC AND WOOD SO THAT MAKES IT HEAVIER,MABL I AS THE EARTHWAPASTW EVIER
4343,I PUT THE THINGS IN THE BUCKETS TO SEE HOW HEAVY THEY WERE,I PUT THE THINGS IN THE BOR
4344,USE A SCALE,USIL
4345,SEE THERE'S EIGHT GRAMS IN THIS CUP SO THE CUP IS THIS METAL DISC IS EQUAL TO EIGHT GRAMS THAT'S HOW YOU CAN FIGURE IT OUT,SES EIGHT CRAMPS IN THE UB METOW ST IS   EG  YOU CAN FE
4346,IT'S IMPORTANT TO GET THE ACCURATE MEASUREMENTS UNLESS Y IF YOU WANT TO GET IF YOU WANT TO KNOW HOW E MUCH SOMETHING WEIGHS N TO GET IF YOU'RE GOING TO BUY SOMETHING,IPUR CSARMESERMONTS UN LEIF YO F YO WT  MUCH THMAM AF YOARE GOIN TO SOMTHING
4347,I THINK THIS IS HAPPENING BECAUSE IT IS REPRESENTING THE ELECTRICITY,I THINK TH  HAPENBECAS REPRESENTINGELETISOTY
4348,IT IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE IF IF ONE LIGHT BULB DIES THEN THE OTHER STAYS,T IS IMPRTN ECA ONE LIBEL DS IN THE OTHER STAE
4349,NO IT IS NOT DIFFERENT,ODOSNOT
4350,THE PATHWAYS DON'T ONLY GO THROUGH THE METAL PART OF THE LIGHT BULB BUT THEY ALSO GO THROUGH THE FUSE OF THE LIGHT BULB,THE PAHWAYS DON'T LY GOW THRO THE MAO PART  LIT  R
4351,A SERIES CIRCUIT IS AN ELECTRICAL CIRCUIT WITH ONLY ONE PATHWAY A PARALLEL CIRCUIT IS AN ELECTRICAL CIRCUIT WITH TWO MORE THAN ONE PATHWAY,A TERO IAN LLECLE CIRCUST WITH ONLY ONE PATPALE WIMOR THEN ONE PATHWAY
4352,THAT IS REPRESENTING THE ELECTRICITY FLOWING THROUGH THE LIGHT BULBS,REPRESENTING HE ELLECTISOTY FLOYING THRO THE LIFE BOAKS
4353,THEY ARE DIFFERENT FROM SERIES CIRCUITS BECAUSE THEY WOULD HAVE MORE THAN ONE PATHWAY AND SERIES CIRCUITS ONLY HAVE ONE PATHWAY,MERO IRCUS BECAS THA WLD HAVE MOR TEN ONE PATHWA IN TEROS CIRCUS NLY ONEPATH
4354,YES I DID,MUAED
4355,WE'VE BEEN LEARING ABOUT SERIES AND PARALLEL CIRCUITS,WE'VE BEN LEARNINGABOUT SERIUS IN PALICUS
4356,THE ELECTRICITY IS FLOWING FROM THE BATTERY TO ONE LIGHT BULB AND THROUGH THAT LIGHT BULB IT IS IT IS FLOWING THROUGH MORE WIRES TO ANOTHER LIGHT BULB,THE ELLECTISIDY IS FLOWING FROM THE ONNTHRO THAT  FLOWING THROW MWATERS  HER
4357,GOOD,GOOD
4358,THEY FLOW THROUGH THE R THEY FLOW THROUGH THE METAL AND THE LIGHT BULB HOLDERS,THE FLOW TOTHE FLOW TO  MAOW ON THE LIPEBOL HOLDER
4359,IT IS A PARALLEL CIRCUIT BECAUSE THERE ARE TWO PATHWAYS,IS A PEAR SIRCUSBECAUSE THE TO PATHWAE
4360,THERE ARE TWO PATHWAYS FROM THE LI FROM THE BATTERY THAT ARE GOING TO THE TWO DIFFERENT LIGHT BULBS,T TOPAH FROM FROM THE BUTTERAR GOING T  TWO DIFRENT LABELS
4361,I DISCOVERED THAT THE ELECTRICITY IS FLOWING THROUGH THE METAL ON THE LIGHT BULB HOLDERS,I DISCUVERED THE ELLECTISOTY IS FLOWING THR THE METO ONTHE ILDER
4362,BY PATHWAYS I MEAN THE ELECTRICITY FLOWING THROUGH THE WIRES,BI PASTH WAYS I MEAN THE ELLECTIS FLOWING THRO THE BATERE
4363,THIS IS A SERIES CIRCUIT,THIS IS A CHERY CIRCUS
4364,WE HAVE BEEN SEEING WHAT WILL WHAT KIND OF METAL WILL STICK TO MAGNETS,WVT CIND OF METOES WILL STICK TO AGT
4365,MAGNETS WILL JUST STICK TO ANYTHING THAT IS IRON OR STEEL,MAG  WILL JUST STICK TO ENEY THING TH I IREN STELE
4366,I MEAN LIKE UM THE MAGNET IS ATTRACTING THE PAPER CLIP,I MEAN LIKE A THE NIT IS OABTRACT IN THE PAPERLAFE
4367,YES I DID,WE PSIDTED
4368,WE FOUND OUT THAT IRON AND STEEL STICK TO MAGNETS,WEVE SUND OUT THE IRN ASTELED STICK
4369,THEN THE MAGNETISM WOULD NOT GO THROUGH TO THE OTHER MAGNET FROM ONE,AIZOME WILD NGO THROU TOTHE OTHER AT
4370,WE HAVE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT UM ELECTRICITY AND MAGNETISM,BLBILLECTISY NTIZOME
4371,THE THING THAT SURPRISED ME THE MOST WAS MAGNETISM TRAVELLING THROUGH THE IRON OR STEEL OBJECT SO IT COULD PICK UP MORE OF THOSE THINGS,THE TING THT SRPRISED ME THE MOSTMACHNATIZOM TRAVLING THRO THE IRTEBE OBJEC ORICOP OR S
4372,THE TWO MAGNETS ARE STICKING TO EACH OTHER AND IF YOU'VE ONE MAGNET AROUND THEN THE OTHER ONE WILL FOLLOW IT,THE TWO MS ARE STICKING TO E CH OTHER ND  LOVE ONETHEOTHERL
4373,GOOD,GOOD
4374,UM THE THE MAGNET IS PULLING THE PAPER CLIP THROUGH THE PAPER BUT IF IT'S TOO THICK IT WON'T WORK,FRAMENT IS PULYING THE APER  TRO THE PAPERB TO
4375,THEY ARE ATTR THEY'RE ATTRACTING AND AND IF IF YOU MOVE IT AROUND THEN THEY WILL STILL BE STICKING TOGETHER,THE AR BTRACT  ADFHE MOOVES ROUND THEN THEY WILL STILL BE STICKYNG TO GATHER
4376,I MEAN TURN AROUND LIKE IT'S FACING THE OPPOSITE WAY THAT IT SHOULD BE,TRFASING TH OPT WALB
4377,I MEAN LIKE UM BREAK THE FORCE OF ATTRACTION,MFORSE OF ABTRACTION
4378,WE LEARNED THAT THE THE BIGGER NUMBER OF SPACERS THE LESS WASHERS IT WOULD TAKE TO BREAK THE FORCE OF ATTRACTION,WE THE BIGER NUMBER H LESH ASHS TAK  ATRACTION
4379,THE MAGNET IS S STUCK TO NAIL AND AND THE MAGNETISM IS TRAVELLING THROUGH THE NAIL SO THE NAIL WOULD STICK TO THE PAPER CLIP AND IT'S CALLED THE TEMPORARY MAGNET,THE MSTUCK MALTHE MATIZOM IS TRAVLING TRO THE MALTHE MABL WD STICK  PAPER F N  ERE TEMPERY
4380,IT WON'T STICK TO ALUMINUM CHROME OR UM TIN,IT 'T STICK TO ALLUMOM ROM OREN
4381,INTESTINES ABSORB NUTRIENTS AND WATER INTO THE BLOODSTREAM AND COMPACT SOLID WASTE,TE S WATER INTO THE BURDSTRE COMPACT SLLATE
4382,THEY'RE BOTH THE DIGESTIVE SYSTEM I THINK,WTHEA'RE BTS   MI TINK
4383,I NOTICE THAT THEY BOTH HAVE DOTS BUT THE OTHER ONE ONE OF THEM HAS LIKE HAS LIKE SQUARES AND STUFF AROUND IT BUT THE OTHER JUST HAS JUST IS JUST YEAST JUST,I NOTTHA THE BOTH VE JOGS THWONDERVLA LIKE SQAMIOSR
4384,IT MOVES FOOD DOWN INTO THE STOMACH LIKE AFTER YOU CHEW IT IT GOES DOWN IN THE ESOPHAGUS TO GO INTO THE STOMACH TO GO INTO THE SMALL INTESTINE TO GO INTO BIG INTESTINES AND TO GO INTO THE WASTE,MV O DOWNTTHE STUMIC CHEWY EOS O THE O TH TTHE PAST
4385,I DON'T KNOW WHAT'S UP WITH IT,PEA
4386,I SEE SKIN CELLS,I SEE SCAW
4387,STOMACH FURTHER BREAKS DOWN FOOD THROUGH MECHANICAL AND CHEMICAL,T FOR THER RINK DOWN MANICLE AND  CET
4388,SAYS THAT MOUTH BREAKS BREAKS FOOD DOWN IN SMALLER PIECES WITH TEETH AND SALIVA I ALREADY KNEW THAT BY WATCHING A VIDEO JUST TO LET YOU KNOW,THE MOUTH IX  TRU DOWN SL PEASES WITH TEAT IN SL  T
4389,THE HUMAN AND THE PLANT ALSO DIFFERENT I DON'T KNOW THEY'RE JUST,HUMON IN  A A
4390,UHM THAT IT'S LIVING AND HUMANS ARE LIVING SO THEY'RE BOTH LIVING,THAT IT BEM  HUMONS AR LEVING SO
4391,THIS THIS PICTURE IS THE DIGESTIVE SYSTEM LEARNING ABOUT THE DIGESTIVE SYSTEM AND THIS THIS THING HERE IS THE DIGESTIVE SYSTEM FOR THE BUTTERFLY,BIGPICTURE IS DIESTEDBUT TH MNG ASBTRFL
4392,IT'S SHOWING US LIKE EVERYTHING ABOUT HOW IT WORKS YEAH STUFF LIKE THAT,HOWN S IS EVERY HIN ABOUT
4393,I'M GOOD,I'MGOOD
4394,IT GOES THROUGH LIKE THE SMALL INTESTINE AND IT GOES TO THROUGH TO THE BIG INTESTINES TO COME INTO THE WASTE AND THEN IT GOES OUT,CLIKE THE SMAL TESTIOBIGONTESTOMTHE WAST
4395,I NOTICE MUSCLE OR WHATEVER THAT THOSE LITTLE THINGS ARE THAT ARE IN THE LIKE LEG,I NOTIS  SOR WEVER HA
4396,NOTHING I DON'T KNOW,UBOLL
4397,I THINK IT'S SHOWING US THE DIGESTIVE SYSTEM AND HOW THE REST OF YOUR BODY'S LIKE THE LITTLE INTESTINES AND THE BIG INTESTINES AND IT GOES THROUGH AND IT BECOMES WASTE,I THINK CHELLY IS THE BIGUN  WIO CHEST  RC
4398,WE'VE BEEN STUDYING ABOUT,WE'VE C SDI ABOUT
4399,THE STOMACH IT HOLDS LIKE ALL OF THE FOOD THAT GOES DOWN THE ESOPHAGUS AND THEN IT GOES INTO THE SMALL INTESTINE WELL IT'S ALL OF THE FOOD THAT YOU CHEW DOWN,T A    DOWN
4400,THAT THEY'RE BRAIN CELLS,OTHER A ELLS
4401,THE THE DIGESTIVE SYSTEM BUT THE BUT THE BUTTERFLY HAS THE DIGESTIVE TRACT AND THE HUMAN HAS THE CALLED,S ESTOTH BUTERFLE HAS THE IESTED RAC  THE HUMON  COLD
4402,I THINK THAT WILL BE THE LUNGS I AM NOT SURE I AM JUST TAKE IT LOT GUESS BUT I'M PRETTY SURE IT'D BE THE LUNGS,I THINK THAT WILL BE HNSURSTED
4403,I AM NOT I DON'T I THINK THIS I DON'T KNOW,I TINK  ABNORNAML
4404,IT'S SHOWING ABOUT YOUR BREATHING HOW IT GOES HOW YOUR LUNGS GET BIGGER AND SMALLER AND THEN BIGGER AND SMALLER LIKE WHEN YOU ARE WHEN YOU BREATHE IN IT GOES BIGGER BUT WHEN YOU BREATHE OUT IT GOES SMALL,SURI OUBUT YOUR RATHINGAO LUNGS  BIGER  MAN TE BIGERSWWYOU REATHOS BIGER
4405,I HAVE NO CLUE,I HAVE NEW CLEA
4406,EITHER FROM THE MOUTH OR THE NOSE AND IT GOES THROUGH THE THROAT,EAVEN FROM TE MOUTH O THE O EGOS THRO T
4407,SO THIS IS D YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT IT WAS THE IT'S LOOKS LIKE D THAT'S ALL I KNOW BUT IT'S LIKE A SORT OF YELLOW BAR THING AND IT MOVES UP AND DOWN AND IT'S LIKE KIND OF PUSHES OUR LUNGS,STHO TAIN ABOUTITHER ITS LIKE THE  YELLO BARTG UPEN DO PUSHS AS
4408,I DON'T KNOW,
4409,I SEE CO TWO LIKE COMING AND GOING LIKE BLUE CO TWO IS GOING IN AND THE O TWO IS COMING ON TO IT AND I DON'T IT'S SOMETHING LIKE I DON'T,I ZERO TWO LIKE MGLIKE THE BLUE ZERO I GOTRT TO I GAUMNGOM T
4410,IT EASIER IT NEEDS TO COMES IN FROM YOUR NOSE AND YOUR MOUTH,THE EASIER D PSON T

4415,I DON'T KNOW,ABNORMAL
4416,I AM GOOD,I'M GOOD
4417,MAYBE A DECOMPOSER,PSR
4418,IT TELLS ME THAT WORMS AND MUSHROOMS EAT DIFFERENT THINGS AND CATERPILLARS ROLY POLY AND BEETLES,A TELLS ME TH WARMTH ROADIFRNT THINGS WN CATPLLEY S AN
4419,I'M NOT SURE,I'M NOT SORE
4420,I THINK IT'S A DECOMPOSER BUT I'M NOT VERY SURE,I THINK COMPSERE NOTVERY SORE
4421,I THINK PINE CONE GRASS THE MUSHROOM AND THE BACTERIA,I THINK PLAYIN COLLED GAS  MAROME IN THE URTERYARD
4422,A SNAKE,SNAKE
4423,THAT'S COOL,ATSCHOOL
4424,IT'S A CONSUMER BECAUSE YOU EAT THEY EAT OTHER ANIMALS,CANSUMER BECS THER THEALS
4425,THE GROUND,GROWD
4426,I DON'T KNOW,ORMA
4427,CAUSE BECAUSE BEARS THAT'S ALL THAT REALLY EATS MEAT AND HIPPOS BUT THE OTHER ANIMALS DON'T REALLY EAT MEAT THEY EAT LIKE BANANAS AND OTHER STUFF,BECAUSE B SAL REALLY EATS M ATHE OTHER ANMALES LIKE STAE
4428,THE OWL A BIRD THE BEETLE A LIZARD THE BUNNY AND THE SNAKE,THE AB BAUTF  ONTHE STNAKES
4429,THAT THEY MAKE SOIL,ICTOYAL
4430,THAT MEANS THAT THEY THEY ARE I DON'T KNOW,THAT MEINS UPA TH ADO
4431,I THINK IT'S THE WATER IN THE GROUND OR THE SUN ALL THE ENERGY THAT'S IN THE SUN I THINK HELPS THE PLANTS GROW,I THINK TON HWATERIN THE GROUN FOR H HNARETRES IN  SAUNI TH HELP THE PLANS GROW
4432,I CAN NOT HEAR YOU RIGHT NOW,I CLNOTA OU NOW
4433,A SNAKE,SNAKE
4434,WHY DO YOU HATE ME SO MUCH I DON'T KNOW CAUSE I CAN'T HEAR YOU YOU'RE MAKING ME SO BAD RIGHT NOW,WHY D YOU HET ME SOMUCECAUS OU
4435,I DON'T KNOW,AL
4436,BECAUSE THEY ALL EAT MEAT CAUSE THE TIGER THE LION THE WOLF AND THE SHARK AND ALL OF THEM EAT MEAT SO THAT'S PRETTY MUCH HOW THEY CONNECT,BCAUSE THEY ALLCAS THE TGO WOLN  SHVPRY MUCH
4437,THING THAT MAKES THEM REALLY FAT,MAKS OME LTHATCH
4438,IT IS A MUSHROOM,AMSHM
4439,WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT SYSTEMS AND DECOMPOSERS COMPOSERS AND PRODUCERS,WBOUT Y COMPS COMPSERESPRDUS A
4440,THEY'RE ALL ABOUT I THINK THE SOIL AND OTHER STUFF I'M NOT REALLY SURE I CAN'T REMEMBER,THA ALBOT I THINK  H SOY  THER TO RELY SOREER
4441,THEY'RE A CONSUMER BECAUSE BACTERIA AND FUNGI THEY DO PRETTY MUCH THE SAME THING TO ANIMALS AND FOODS,TE COUMER B ACTEION UNGY D ERY MUCH LIKE THE SAME IANMALA
4442,A CARNIVORE,AROF
4443,CARNIVORE,UNOURE
4444,I THINK IT'S A CONSUMER BECAUSE IT EATS OTHER CONSUMERS THEY EAT PLANTS AND MEAT BUT STILL IT EATS CONSUMERS LIKE A LOT OF DIFFERENT THINGS LIKE PEOPLE FISH,I THINKCA SU BECAUS EAT OTHERS CANSPLAN A   MORBOUT  DIFRENT THINGS LIKE PEOPLE
4445,A LIVING ORGANISM,LINGORGANIZAME
4446,BACTERIA,ATTURI

4449,CAN YOU PLEASE REPEAT,CULD YOU PLEASER
4450,IT IT HELPS THE ENVIRONMENT ACTUALLY BECAUSE THEY EAT PAPER AND OTHER STUFF SO I THINK THAT HELPS THE ENVIRONMENT,ELPES THE NBEAS THE STOFFE S
4451,THEY MAKE SOIL AND HELP PLANTS GROW,THE M SOYAL LAW
4452,I THINK AN EATS MORE LIKE PLANTS AND LIKE LEAVES AND AND MORE LEAVES AND MORE STUFF LIKE YEAH JUST PLANTS I GUESS,I THINK A EARBBOR EATS ORLIKE LANTM LETHS I BWHN  LES AN OSTUAT
4453,THEY BOTH EAT THEY BOTH EAT LIKE LEAVES,THE THA BAT  LEF
4454,HELLO,O
4455,A DECOMPOSER,HE ECMPLOSERE
4456,A BEAR,UPBARE
4457,BECAUSE IF THEY'RE OUTSIDE THERE MIGHT BE AN EASIER WAY FOR THEM TO LIKE HIDE OF BIRDS AND STUFF,BECAUS AR OUTSIDE TH  EASIER WA FOR THEM  RION
4458,CARNIVORE,ONVAE
4459,MADE IT ALL,MA
4460,IS THAT TOMATO JUICE,A
4461,TO HELP IT GROW BECAUSE LIKE IT HAS TO HAVE FRESH AIR NICE COOL WATER AND SUNLIGHT TO TO GROW,HB CAS  PAS TH FRESH A NIE C WATER IN T SALIS
4462,WELL IT HAS EVERYTHING IT HAS A WATER THE AIR THE SUNLIGHT AND EVERYTHING IT NEEDS TO GROW AND LOOK,WL HASE EVERY THING IHAS WATER TH ASN EVERY HINGEGOW
4463,IT NEEDS SUNLIGHT TO GROW BECAUSE IF IT DOESN'T HAVE ANY SUNLIGHT IT JUST FLOPS,I DEATS SUMEI T GRO BECAS
4464,WELL IT JUST NEEDS WATER OXYGEN CARBON DIOXIDE SUNLIGHT AND YEAH THAT'S ABOUT IT TO SURVIVE,WE JUST EAMES WATER ING CARON THSOM BO
4465,WELL IT LOOKS A LITTLE BETTER BUT IT STILL NEEDS WATER TO GROW BECAUSE LIKE THAT'S THE MAIN THING THAT IT NEEDS IT NEEDS THE WATER TO GET IT ALL LIKE ALL LIKE WOO AWAKE SO IT CAN GROW MORE,I LK  BAER  OWATER TO OWBECAUS NS EATS THWATER I SGROW
4466,BECAUSE IT HAS ALL THE SUNLIGHT IT NEED ALL THE AIR IT NEEDS AND ALL THE WATER IT NEEDS,BECAUSE IT HAS  SUMS THE RA WATERA
4467,MAKE THEIR OWN FOOD BECAUSE UHM I CAN'T REMEMBER WHAT IT'S CALLED THE SUGAR LIKE THE SUGAR LEAVES THE STUFF IN THE PLANT TO FOR IT TO GROW,MAK THE  R LKE HE GRASE SLFN  PLA
4468,UH NOT SURE,
4469,THERE'S NO AIR SO THAT JUST MAKES IT WORSE IT'S PROBABLY JUST GOING TO DIE RIGHT AWAY,THEIS NA SO THAT JUST WR
4470,UHM THE ONE IN THE LIGHT BAG THAT WE DID TURNED ALL GREEN AND ALL PERFECT AND UHM THE ONE IN THE DARK BACK TURNED ALL YELLOW AND IT DIDN'T HAVE AS MUCH GROWN,ONTHI WDIDT TRN T GREEN CONE THE DARB TIRND LIKE A YELLOW IDIDN'T HAVE A CH UM
4471,THERE'S NO SUN,THEIRS NOW SOND
4472,I DON'T KNOW,U
4473,NO SURE,OFSHRE
4474,THE WINGS HELP HIM FLY THAT'S ONE OF THE ADAPTATIONS AND HIS YEAH,THE RINGS HELPE HEM FITER FROM THE A TEMPTATION
4475,I THINK IT LOOKS LIKE HE'S LOOKING FOR PREY,I LOKS THE KEI DOMN
4476,I THINK THAT'S KIND OF INSTINCTIVE BECAUSE IT JUST WHEN YOU HIT IT JUST WHEN YOU HIT THAT PART OF YOUR KNEE YOUR KNEE JUST FLOCKS UP ON ITS OWN SO,I THINKS TINKT TBECAUSE  UST UST WEYO HAS PARTOF YOUR NES OUR NE JUST SLAP M
4477,IT PROTECTS FROM IT PROTECTS THEM FROM LIKE PEOPLE LIKE ANIMALS THAT ARE TRYING TO EITHER EAT THEM OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT,T TECT PEOPLE LIKE ANMLSEATHER EAT THEM OR
4478,HIS SHELL,HISSHOWE
4479,NOT LEARNED BECAUSE YOU'RE NOT JUST TAUGHT YOU'RE JUST NOT TAUGHT LIKE YOU'RE JUST OH IT'S TIME TO COME OUT NOW THEY JUST THEY JUST COME OUT WHENEVER THEY WANT TO COME OUT,CA ARWS TIMOTHA UST TUMOT WHE TH
4480,THE GRASS THE TREES THE WATER ROCKS DIRT LEAVES LOT OF THE LEAVES LOTS OF WATER YOU KNOW,THE GAS THE TREES THE WATERBREATHED  LES AH WATER
4481,I AM GOOD I KNOW WHY I GUESS SO,I'M IN  WA
4482,IT DEPENDS BECAUSE SOMETIMES IT JUST AN INSTINCTIVE BUT SOMETIMES THEY HAVE TO BE TAUGHT,SMTIME USTT SOM TIMETVEAT
4483,I THINK THERE'S A LITTLE IS A A LEARNED BEHAVIOR,I  THINK LZARD IS A  ARM  BEHAVEIEAR
4484,IT'S HIS ADAPTATION,HIS DEMPTATION
4485,AND OH WHAT KNOW AH,EN
4486,HIS SKUNK KNOW MUCH HE SPRAY THAT HE SPRAYS ON ON STUFF SO THAT'S I THINK THIS ONE,HA  CD NO IS B EA BRTHED PEOPLE
4487,WHAT ANIMAL EATS THE OTHER ANIMAL LIKE LET'S SAY THE HAWK EATS THE BIRD THE BIRD EATS THE HAWK THE BUNNY EATS THE HAWK OR THE HAWK OR THE BUNNY GOES INTO THE HAWK SO THAT MEANS THE HAWK EATS THE BIRD I MEAN THE BUNNY OH SORRY,M ANML ETHEOTHEAS  OK B BINTTHE OK KHE BIRD
4488,I DON'T KNOW,O
4489,I'M GOOD,I'MOOD
4490,I THINK IT'S ABOUT LIKE WATER FISH LIKE LIVING THINGS,I THINK ITABOUT LIKE WATER SH LIKE LIVING S
4491,I THINK THEY'RE ALL ABOUT JUST JUST EATING FOOD I GUESS I I DON'T KNOW,I THINK SARLSABOUT JUST ATING D
4492,I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU MEAN,I DON'T NOWT TOMEA
4493,WELL THEY LIKE WORK TOGETHER TO MAKE A SYSTEM I THINK,WILTHE LIKE  TO GATHER TO MAK A ISTMN
4494,I THINK IT MAKES IT A SYSTEM BUT I THE WAY WHAT WAS I THINK I I DON'T KNOW I'VE NOT VERY SURE ABOUT THAT,I THINK IT MAKES U AUM M S THINK  D NONT VERY SORB
4495,I DON'T KNOW,BMA
4496,THE EYES THE HEART AND THE ORGANS,THE  A IN THE ORGANS
4497,I THINK I THINK IT HAS TO DO WITH SYSTEMS IS BECAUSE THAT THERE'S A LOT OF THINGS THAT CAN MOVE LIKE A HUMAN BODY A SUITCASE CAR THE EARTH I DON'T KNOW I'M NOT VERY SURE,I THINK I THINK TS STUPS BECAS THAION OTHINGS AT CAN MOOVE LKE A HUMON BOLDY THERTH
4498,I AM NOT SURE,IAMLOT

4500,WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT PRODUCERS CONSUMERS AND CONSUMERS,WE 'VE BIN LEARING ABOUTHP DUSER DE CON SUMERSCONSUMO
4501,BECAUSE THEY CAN MOVE I THINK I'M NOT VERY SURE,BECAUSE FTHINKS ARM NOT VERY SHORE
4502,I THINK THEY'RE LIKE THE SAME BECAUSE THEY HAVE TO DO WITH SOMETHING LIKE LIVING THINGS AND THE EARTH AND TREES AND WATER AND STUFF AND FISH,I THINK LIKE THE SAME BECAUS THE  E WITH SOMTHN LIK LIVNG SING IN THE EARTHREATERSTISH
4503,I SEE WATER HOUSES TREES CORAL AND I THINK THAT'S A MOUNTAIN,I S WATER HOUSS
4504,I DON'T KNOW,
4505,I'M NOT SURE WHAT THEY'RE CALLED I THINK THERE IS I THINK THERE'S FIVE OR LIKE TEN OR SOMETHING I DON'T KNOW,I'M NOT SHOURE WITH A COLD   TINK THA IS  THINK OR TENTER FROM INOW
4506,SORRY WHAT,SARVLET
4507,I'M GOOD,I'MGOOD
4508,NO NOT SO FAR,NOSOFAR
4509,IT DOESN'T HAVE C INCHES,DOESN'T HAVE IMES
4510,SO YOU CAN MEASURE STUFF WITHOUT A RULER,SYOU CAN ASERE STAPFS WITH OUT ROLLA
4511,YEP,YEL
4512,DA UH WE HAD DIFFERENT ANSWERS WE HAD GROUPS AND THEN WE HAD DIFFERENT ANSWERS AND THA AND THAT WAS BECAUSE MISTER FROLLER HAD CHANGED THE SIZE OF THE STRAWS,WE HAD DIFRNT WE HAD GREPS IN TH WE HAD DIFRN ANTTHAT WAS BECAUSE MICHANGED THE SIGE OTHE TAS
4513,YEAH I JUST STARTED THIS WEEK,WE  JUSTSTARTED THE W
4514,YEAH,YEL
4515,I WOULD CHANGE,OTCHANGE
4516,THAT SOME OF THEM CAN BE SHORTER AND LONGER AND THAT TAKES DIFFERENT MEASUREMENTS MMM HMM YEAH,THSZOMOF THEME CAN BE SHORT LOGTA TAKS DIFRNT MESERMONTS
4517,THAT W TEN CENTIMETERS WOULD BE HALF FROM MY WRIST TO MY ELBOW,TTEN SEVENMATORS WILL BE HA FROM M RIST TO M ELBO
4518,YEAH AND THEN WE MADE OUR OWN METER STICKS THAT HAS CENTIMETERS AND DECAMETERS IT BUT IT DOESN'T HAVE INCHES,AO ON AO STICKSHAS SEVENMAO INESNHE
4519,NOT EXACTLY,NOACT
4520,UH I FORGOT,A
4521,YEAH CAUSE SOMETIMES YOU DON'T BRING A RULER TO WHERE YOU'RE GOING AND THEN YOU NEED TO SHOW WHERE IT IS,CSUMTIMES YOU DON'T BING A ROLLER  WILLO EA SHHIS
4522,YEAH,YELW
4523,THAT'S ABOUT FROM THE BACK OF THIS CHAIR TO OLIVIA BACK THERE,BACCHAIR TO LVOBT
4524,YEAH THAT MEANS THAT IT'S TEN STRAWS ACROSS FROM ME AND THEN THREE STRAWS THIS WAY,THAT MAN TEN T CO THREE  IS WAY
4525,NO,NOW
4526,WE MEASURED OUR DESKS IN STRAWS,WE MEZURED ARE DETS IN STRA
4527,WELL THAT THEY ARE THAT THEY SOMETIMES DO WRONG MEASUREMENTS CAUSE THEY GET BENT AND STUFF AND THEN THAT SHRINKS EM A LITTLE BIT,WIL A AR  SOME TIMES TO ROL ESERMONT BCAUS ANT STF THE
4528,THAT T THE DRY SPONGE IS TWO GRAMS THE WET SPONGE IS SIXTEEN GRAMS AND THE WATER WA SO THE WATER WAS FOURTEEN GRAMS,T  IXT WATER ST ATER I FORT TEN ATS
4529,T FOR SCRUBBING FOR SCRUBBING BECAUSE YOU CAN GET A LOT OF WATER IN IT AND THEN WHEN YOU PUSH DOWN THE WATER COMES OUT AND THEN YOU CAN DO THE SAME THING TO PUT SOAP IN IT,YOU CAN GET ATERYOU PUSH DOWN THE WATERDW THE SAME THING TPUTOPEN
4530,IT'S WEIGHING IT AND THE SPONGE IS THERE AND IT'S HEAVIER THAN THIN AIR,WAING THE SPUNSH IS THEAR  HEVYER EAR
4531,TWO GRAMS,TOOA
4532,A BALANCE,OTS
4533,YEAH ABSORBS IT,UB
4534,THE SPONGE IS GROWING BIGGER,THE SPN S GROWING BIGAR
4535,LIKE YESTERDAY WE WEIGHED LIKE PENCILS AND OTHER STUFF,YESTRDAY WE  ED TENSTOLES IN THE R
4536,UM IT WEIGHS SIXTEEN GRAMS MMM HMM,THAT IL SIX T GRANTS
4537,IT HAS TWO GRAMS IN THERE AND THEN IT HAS A SPONGE ON THE OTHER SIDE AND IT'S EXACTLY EQUAL,A TWO RANIN THA A SPUMS ON OTHER SIDE  EGZACT EACWL
4538,FROM HERE I SUBTRACTED TWO TO SIXTEEN AND THAT'S FOURTEEN S SO THAT'S HOW MUCH THE WATER WAS,IR  TWO TSIXTEN FOURATERAS
4539,NO DRY AND THEN WET,NORDRA
4540,NO WE DIDN'T HAVE ENOUGH TIME,YOUDIDN'T HAVE ANTMEW
4541,IT'S SUCKING IT IN AND HOLDING IT IN THE AIR BUBBLES,HOLDING IT IN THE ARB
4542,HI,
4543,I DIDN'T MAKE A CHART THERE WAS JUST QUESTIONS TO ANSWER,SJUS CEASTION
4544,YEAH,YE
4545,PROBABLY,FGE
4546,THAT TOLD ME THE MASS OF THE WATER,TU M  WATER
4547,YEAH,
4548,YEAH WE HAD A LITTLE PIECE OF PAPER TO WRITE IT DOWN ON,WE HAD A LIT PISOPER
4549,MOST OF EM,MOST
4550,THAT THE WATER WEIGHED A L HAD A LOT OF MASS,TH WATER E A OM
4551,YEAH,
4552,YEAH,
4553,YUP,
4554,WITH THAT IT MADE IT IT MADE THE WATER MADE THE SPONGE IN OUR WAY IT MADE THE SPONGE WEIGH FIFTY GRAMS WHEN IT WAS ONLY THREE,MAD MTHE WATER MAD THE SPUNIN AR W   SPUA FIFTY RAMS W ONLY THREE
4555,THE WA IT'S ABSORBING THE WATER,ABSOR IN THE WATER
4556,IT WOULD START POURING OUT,HE W ST
4557,YEP,
4558,THAT ALL THE LITTLE BUBBLES FILLED WITH WATER,H E LE BOBS FILLD WITH WATER
4559,YEAH,
4560,IT'S GOT A WET SPONGE THAT WEIGHS,WES GAUGHT AWES FROM THE AES
4561,SOME A LOT,SOME
4562,WHAT DID I DO TO FIGURE OUT THE DIFFERENCE I MULTIPLIED,H I I ME E FIUR THE  MALTPLAD
4563,YEAH I TOOK AWAY TO FIND,WTF
4564,YEAH,
4565,THEY ALL ABSORB,LYOFFSORE
4566,PROBABLY UM WEIGHING OTHER STUFF,E WA ETHER STAFF
4567,IT WOULD START SLOWLY POURING OUT,TASLOLY POUGO
4568,YEAH,
4569,BECAUSE THE POINT IS POINTING STRAIGHT DOWN,BECAUS THE POINT IS POITING STRAET DOWN
4570,NOTHING JUST AIR,NOTHING
4571,NO SUBTRACTION,UBGESTION
4572,WELL THERE E THE WATER ITSELF WEIGHED FORTY SEVEN GRAMS,TH WATER ISELLF S FORTY SEVEN GRANDS
4573,MMM HMM AND THAT IT HA WAS PRETTY HEAVY,AND THE WAS PERETY HEY
4574,YEAH,
4575,TWENTY ST IT COULD ABSORB E SEVENTEEN TIMES AS MUCH,TWENY IT OLD ZAR EGHT SEVEN TEN TIMES IS MUCH
4576,THEY'RE PROBABLY IS BUT I DON'T REMEMBER IT,THE OBTREE
4577,WE UM BUILT OUR BOATS OUT OF LITTLE PAPER CUPS WITH WAX,WEE BIULT ERBTS A LITLL PAPER C WITH WA
4578,WELL WE USED PENNIES AS PASSENGERS AND THE SIZE WAS IMPORTANT SO THAT WE COULD SEE HOW MANY PASSENGERS IT COULD HOLD,WEL WEL YOUSED PEN PASONDERES THSIDS MTHT W CAN SAERESHOLD
4579,SEE YA,S
4580,YOU TOO,UTE
4581,UM WE WOULD PUT THE PENNIES IN CAREFULLY AND KEEP IT BALANCED ON ALL SIDES SO THAT IT DIDN'T SINK AS QUICKLY,WE WLLD PUT THE MONEY IN CAR FLY AND CEP BALINCTED ON ALL SIDEID THIN CUICKLY
4582,THANK YOU,AN
4583,THEY'RE DESIGNED TO FLOAT AND HOLD PEOPLE,THAR DESIN FN HOLD PEOPLE
4584,IT SH THEY EACH SHOW UM HOW MANY MILLILITERS OF WATER THEY EACH HOLD,THE E S HAVE MLEADER
4585,EACH ARE DIFFERENT HEIGHT AND UM THEY EACH SINK UH LOWER AND HIGHER IN TO THE WATER DEPENDING ON HOW TALL THEY ARE,E AR DIFRENT HI ITHE ES LWUR I INTO THE WATERPA
4586,THEY MIGHT HAVE BEEN UM DIFFERENT CUPS AND THEY MIGHT NOT HAVE BEEN EQUALLY UM MADE AND UH CUT LEVELLY,THEAY MIGHT E BIN DIFRN CUPS  THAY MIGHT NOT AVE N EACWALL AD
4587,UM IT WAS UH LIKE IT WAS ACTUALLY THE WATER THAT WE UM TOOK OUT OF THE THINGS AND THEN PUT THEM IN THIS CONTAINER THAT SHOWED MILLILITERS AND THAT'S HOW WE GOT OUR RESULTS,T WAS ATLY THE WATER TOK INGS TPUTTM THE CONTUNER HUD  LEADERSIT
4588,UM I WAS AMAZED TO SEE THAT WHEN WE PUT THE PASSENGERS IN UM UM JUST A LITTLE CUP OF YOU PUT A CIRCLE AROUND IT AND EVEN THE BALANCE THEN IT MAY IT YOU COULD GET A LOT OF PASSENGERS IN THERE,WN WE PUT THE PASONDIERES IN YOU  CIRCULS ROUNDT EVEN THBALNT YOU CAN GET AOT F PASNGERER
4589,WE MADE TWO BOATS THAT WERE THREE CENTIMETERS LONG,BTS T THREE SEVEN TMATORS ALONG
4590,BY UM DOING THEM UM CORRECTLY AND ORDERLY AND UH SLOWLY SO THAT YOU CAN GET UH ACCURATE DATA,BY UN DWING THCORECT L AN OURDER L N  SOLY SOR TAT YOU CAN GET AATEE
4591,UM I HAD ANOTHER DAY IN SCIENCE AND UH WE WORKED ON BOATS AND UM WE UH HAD VARIABLES AND OTHER LIKE THINGS AND IT WAS IN LIKE A LITTLE TUB,I HAD AN OTHER EM SINND WE WR ON BTS N O WE HAD VERIABLEIK THINGS  TUB
4592,WELL WHEN WE MEASURED THEM WE MADE SURE THAT THEY WERE EACH UH DIFFERENT UM HEIGHT AND YEAH,WHEN WE MESERED THEMMA A DIFRNT HITA
4593,GOOD,GOOD
4594,YOU COULD MAY BE ADD MORE PENNIES OR TAKE AWAY THE PENNY AND ADD SOMETHING UM DIFFERENT LIKE A DIFFERENT OBJECT TO IT,O CADMY PONEY SSMTK A FROBJECTT
4595,YOU HAVE TO PICK IT UP AND THEN LET IT SWING AND WHEN IT GOES BACK AND FORTH AND LIKE,YO'VE HAVE TO PICATUP LIT SWING IN MGOS BANFOURTH
4596,THAT WITH THE HIGHER SWINGS UM THE UM IN FIFTEEN SECONDS IT DID UM IT HAD MORE CYCLES,STHAT WIL THE IGHER SPWING GUM HIN FIFTEEN SECOND  DD IT HAD OR CICL BS
4597,WHEN YOU PUT IT AT THE TOP IT STARTS BUT GRADUALLY IT'LL START TO UM DECREASE UM IN HOW HIGH IT GOES CAUSE THERE'S NOT ENOUGH FORCE AND THE WEIGHT IS WEIGHING IT DOWN,WHEN YOU PUS THE TOPTAT RAGLLY START T T ECAUS THEIRS NOT OTHE OWN
4598,WELL WHEN IT SWINGS BACK AND FORTH THE WEIGHT WOULD CAUSE IT TO SINK LOWER AND NOT GO AS HIGH WHEN IT COMES BACK AROUND AND COMPLETES THE CYCLE,SPINGS BANFORTHTHE  AWHENIT CUMS BACKGROUNDPLTIKLES
4599,IT MEANS THAT IT'S A CERTAIN THING IN AN EXPERIMENT THAT YOU COULD CHANGE OR KEEP THE SAME AND IT'S PART OF THE EXPERIMENT,MNS THAT  A SIRTN TING IN  XPEMINTYOU CAN CHANGE RTHE SAME HE EXPEMONT
4600,WELL THERE IS MORE UM THERE IS ONE ON ONE AND THEN LIKE IT GOES IN THE NUMBER OF HOW MANY THERE ARE AND I THINK WELL WELL OF COURSE IT WILL IT WOULD CAUSE MORE WEIGHT,THERIS THERS ONE ON  TECOS IN THE NI THINK FST M
4601,WHEN I CLICK THE BOB GOES TO WHERE I CLICKED,WHEN I CLLECT THE BOB GOWS TOAR
4602,WHAT'S THE TABLE FOR,LTTHE TAPLE BFROM A
4603,THE CYCLE IS WHEN IT GOES BACK AND BACK AND THEN BACK AGAIN TO WHERE IT USED TO BE,TH SIC IS WHEN E OSBBAOND
4604,YES,GEST
4605,YES,YEL
4606,UH AT THE END OF THE STRING THERE IS ITS WEIGHT AND IT WILL KEEP THE STRING MOVING,A THE ND THE  ET SRING MVANG
4607,WELL SINCE IT'S AT THE END OF THE STRING IT WILL CAUSE THE STRING NOT TO GO FLIMSY AND AROUND,WL  IT WL CAS THE STT  FROM VIAND
4608,IT GOES DOWN AND UP AND THEN DOWN AND UP AGAIN TO UH THE PLACE WHERE IT WAS BUT IT'S STILL LOWER THAN,TA  OPNER DOPSTL
4609,I MAY PUT UM SOMETHING THAT'S NOT A PENNY AND MAY BE IT WOULD CAUSE MORE WEIGHT,PUT ON SOME THING THAT N APN BECS RE
4610,MAY BE IF YOU UM HAD A BIGGER PENCIL TO HANG IT FROM THEN UM IT MIGHT UH AFFECT MAY BE HOW HIGH IT GOES,MABE IYW CAUGHT A BIGIR PONSOLE T ANG IT FROM THEN MY ATECH T
4611,WHEN I DID IT TWO TIMES UH I REALIZED THAT THE CYCLES WERE THE SAME BOTH TIMES,NDDNT TWO TIME I RELLIZE THE SICULOES IR THE SAME
4612,YOU CAN SEE HOW MANY TIMES IT WILL S MAKE A CYCLE UM IN FIFTEEN SECONDS,YOU CAN SEE HO MNEY TIMES IT WILLTSIIG UMS
4613,YOU CAN COLLECT IT ON A DATA FILE,YOU CAN COLLECT ON A TFIRE
4614,THAT WOULD DEPEND ON WHAT KIND OF VARIABLES THEY WERE AND WHAT THEY WERE CHANGING,THAT WILL DEPEN ON WOT CINT OF VERRABLES THING
4615,THE LONGER THE UM PENDULUM THE SHORTER AMOUNT OF STRINGS THAT UH I MEAN THE SHORTER AMOUNT OF CYCLES THAT IT HAS,THE LTHE OUNHALOM TH SHAMOT O RING MA RLE
4616,UM WELL UM I WELL I DON'T REALLY KNOW,I'WL  I ONT RELLY NOW
4617,AT THE X AXIS UM THERE'S NOTHING,THE EECTI S NOTHING
4618,UM THE THINGS THAT UH HAS BEEN CHANGED IS THE LENGTH OF THE STRING UM WHICH THEY SWANG,BIRTS BE CHANGED THE LENGTHS THE STRINWA
4619,THAT UM THE MORE THE CENTIMETERS THE LESS THE CYCLES SO IT GOES FROM ONE TWENTY TO FIFTEEN AND IT GOES FROM SEVEN TO TWENTY,THOUR THE SEVENMEATOR HA ICRO  EO FROM ONE TWENTY O FIFTEN ZEO FROM SEVEN TOTWENTY
4620,BYE,FIVE
4621,YES BECAUSE UM BECAUSE THEY ONLY CHANGED ONE VARIABLE FROM THE LONGER UH STRING,BECAUSE ME BECAUSE THEATONLY CHANGED ONE VERIA BOLL FROM THE LON THE SRIN
4622,WELL WE UM DIDN'T CHANGE THE TIME BECAUSE WE KNEW FOR CERTAIN THAT THERE WOULD MORE UM SWINGS IF WE CHANGED THE TIME,UM DIDN'T CHANGE THE TIME BECAUSE W NEW FSRON THLE SWHAED
4623,I FOUND OUT THAT THE SHORTER THE STRING THE UM THE LESS UH CYCLES IT HAS,I FOUND OUSTARTED ING THECIRCUMSTATAC
4624,I MEAN THE MORE CYCLES THAT IT HAS,I MEAN ACICUMS
4625,UM IT'S A PENDULUM WITH A BOB AT THE END AND IT'S ON A HIGH POINT UM AND IT'S HANGING FROM A PENCIL,TME WITH A BOBER Y  N ITS ON AHY POINT A  HANGING FROM T
4626,IT HAS CERTAIN FIXTURES AND UM IT DOESN'T CHANG IT DOESN'T CHANGE MUCH,AD HAS SIRTUN ICXJURS IDOEST DOESN'T CHANGE MUCH
4627,UM ON THE Y AXIS,UMON THE WIAIS
4628,I MEAN THINGS THAT WE CHANGED IN UM DIFFERENT SERIES OF THE EXPERIMENT,I MEAING THINGS THAT WE CHANGED IN ADIFRNT TERIOUS EXPIMIONT
4629,THEY ARE UM HOW MANY CYCLES AND THE LENGTH,TAY AR HO MENEY SICES IN THE LAS
4630,PRETTY GOOD,A
4631,I FOUND THE LENGTH OF HOW UM LONG THE STRINGS WERE AND OF HOW MANY CYCLES THEY HAD,OU T LENGT  THE SPRING   MNY CICLES THEY HAD
4632,UH I IN SCIENCE TODAY I LEARNED THAT WHEN YOU TRIED THE RELEASE POSITION IT DOESN'T CHANGE THE LENGTH OF HOW MANY CYCLES IT DID,SIGDE TODAY I LIRTT WN YO TRY HRELIEFE PION IT DOUESN'T CHANGE THE LNGTH  MNY SICLES
4633,WELL TODAY WE LEARNED HOW TO UM UH WE WELL WE WORKED ON PENDULUMS AGAIN AND WE UH SHOWED THEM AT DIFFERENT ANGLES AND WE CHANGED UM SOME VARIABLES,DAY WE LURN HO T LL WE ARCH ON S LUM AGNN WE SHO THEMIFRNT ANESN WE CAED M VEIABLES
4634,UM SO THAT THINGS DON'T GET OUT OF CONTROL AND YOU DON'T HAVE TOO MANY UM THINGS THAT ARE NOT ALIKE,THAT THINKS DON'T GAT CONROLL N YOU DON'T HAVE TOO MNY THINNS ARIKE
4635,WHEN IT WENT UM DOWN AND WENT BACK UP AGAIN IT WENT AT A SLIGHTLY LOWER UH PLACE,WT DOWN BAUPGNITA SLTLY
4636,WE WERE TRYING TO FIND OUT HOW THE PENDULUMS WORKED AND UH WHAT MADE THEM DIFFERENT AND WHAT MADE THEM THE SAME,WE WR TRYING TO FIND OUT HO THE MA THEM DIFRM THE SAME
4637,IT DOESN'T MATTER UH HOW MUCH WEIGHT THERE IS UM IT JUST MATTERS HOW LONG THE STRING IS,IT DOUSN'T MATER O MUCH WTHEI IT JUST MATORES ALLONG THE STRIN
4638,IT SHOWS ON THE TOP UH HOW MANY CYCLES IT HAD UM ON THE SIDE IT SHOWS HOW LONG THE STRINGS WAS,O E MN SCES IT HAS  NSID TSHOWDE LONG THE STRN
4639,I WOULD PUT IT UM AFTER LIKE AFTER THE NAME OF THE BOAT AND I WOULD PUT IT THERE AFTER IN UNDER THE UH SIGN THAT SAYS CAPACITY AND TELL HOW MANY MILLILITERS,PUT IT ON AFTER AER THE NAME ONTHE PUTIT THECPASDY  TLNY ELLEATORS
4640,M YOU CAN FIGURE OUT HOW MANY PENNIES CAN GO IN TO IT AND HOW MUCH WATER IT CAN HOLD,YOU CAN FICER OUT HO MONEY PNEYS  GO IN THMUCH WATERIT AN HOLD
4641,UM WE DECIDED UM TO KEEP THE KIND OF CUP THE IT WAS AND THE CONSTRUCTION OF THE CUP AND HOW IT WAS CUT NOT THE LENGTH BUT YEAH UM WE ALSO DECIDED HOW MUCH WATER WE HAD IN THE TUB TO KEEP THE SAME AND YEAH,HEN WEV DESIDED TO EP  TH CON DISHION INTH
4642,WELL WE MADE FOUR DIFFERENT SIZES SO THAT WE COULD SEE HOW MANY PENNIES EACH COULD HOLD AND THE AMOUNT OF WATER THEY COULD EACH HOLD,WE MAD FOUR DIFRENT SIGES T WAN S HPNS THATER THE LD
4643,THEY STAY THE SAME AND UM UH DON'T MAKE THE EXPERIMENT TOO DIFFERENT THAN IT MIGHT HAVE U MIGHT HAVE BEEN OR USED TO BE,THEAY STAI THE SAME A UMMAKE THE AXPEROMIENT DIFRNVBINUOB
4644,OH I WOULD PUT IT ON THE BOTTOM,PUT IT ON THE BOTTAM
4645,AND ALSO SETTING UP A DATA CHART,IND OLSO ENG P AERT
4646,THE CAPACITY GOES ON THE BOTTOM AND UH THE NUMBER OF PASSENGERS GOES ON THE SIDE,THE CPASOTY GOS ON THE BOTMTHE NOMBERED PASONDIERES S NSIDE
4647,WE USED THE SYRINGE TO UM UH TAKE THE WATER OUT AND UH PUT THEM IN A LITTLE CONTAINER THAT MEASURED IN MILLILITERS UH TO SEE HOW MANY MILLILITERS EACH CUP COULD HOLD,V TH IN TO TAKE T ATERCONTATR MSLEADERO SOOLDE
4648,UH I FORGOT WHAT A STANDARD PROCEDURE IS,I FOR GUGHTSTAMPBESEZR
4649,IT DOESN'T UM CAUSE THE BOAT TO SINK AND THEN POP UP AGAIN CAUSE WHEN IT DOES THAT THEN THE WATER MIGHT SPLASH IN TO IT AND CAUSE IT TO SINK FASTER,E SINK  TH WHEN DOES T H WATER I SPLASH IN TOW IT AND CASTIT TO SINK FASTER
4650,WE UH USED DIFFERENT UH HEIGHTS IN THE CUPS AND BUT WE KEPT EVERYTHING ELSE THE SAME AND WE ONLY CHANGED ONE VARIABLE WHICH MADE IT A CONTROLLED EXPERIMENT,IN  HT IN THE WE APED EVERY THING  THE SAME CAD ARBONT
4651,UM THE VARIABLE THAT'S BEING CHANGED IS THE HEIGHT OF THE CUPS AND YEAH,THE VEBOL BEING CAMGED IS THE HIT  THE SN
4652,WE HAD TO THINK ABOUT HOW WE WERE GOING TO PUT THEM IN AND UH WE HAD TO PREDICT HOW MANY WOULD FIT IN THERE BEFORE IT'S SUNK,AD THINK ABOUT GLWEVE HAD  C LFIT IN THE
4653,WE WE UM USED THE UM WAIT,WE AUS THE UM
4654,IT UM STAYS A CONTROLLED EXPERIMENT,STAT CAN HOLD XPERMENT
4655,WE CHANGED THE LENGTH OF THE CUPS TO SEE HOW MANY HOW MUCH WATER AND HOW MANY PENNIES THEY COULD HOLD AND THE PENNIES WERE PASSENGERS,WE' CHANGED THE LINGT  PS  HAVE MUCH ATER PAGERES
4656,ONLY ONE VARIABLE TO KEEP IT CONTROLLED,ONLY ONE VERITROL
4657,YEAH YEAH,

4770,NOT EXACTLY BUT THE MAGNETIC FORCE FROM THE MAGNET CAN GO THROUGH AN OBJECT AS LONG AS IT'S THIN ENOUGH TO STICK TO THE PAPER CLIP,LE PUT THE AETIC ORSE FROM THE T  OBJECT TIOH T STICKS THE PAPER
4771,HI,
4772,YES,YES
4773,THE ENERGY FROM THE BATTERY IS GOING INTO THE MOTOR MAKING IT SPIN AND GOING OUT OF THE MOTOR THROUGH THE BATTERY AND BACK OUT AGAIN IN A CIRCUIT,THE EMEARGY FROM THE BATEIS OTHE MOADER INTSPOON ON GON OUTOF THE MOADER THROW THE AERY BAA IRCUS
4774,HI MARNEY,I
4775,YOU ALREADY SAID THAT,OL READY SE THAT
4776,WHY AREN'T YOU WORKING,WHI WAING
4777,YES,
4778,THE BATTERY IS ABOUT OH THE BATTE,THE AD IS A BI OT
4779,YOU ALREADY SAID THAT,WE'VE OLL READY I THT
4780,HI,
4781,IT DOESN'T REALLY AFFECT THE LIGHT BULBS BUT I GUESS IT REVERSES THE FLOW OF ENERGY,IT DOUSN'T REALLY ECT HE LIEBOF ENERGY
4782,THE BATTERY'S ABOUT SENDING ELECTRICITY,THE BATTERBOT SN ALLECTRISOTY
4783,BECAUSE THE MOTOR'S SPINNING WHICH IS A SIGN THAT THE ENERGY IS FLOWING ALL THE WAY THROUGH THE CIRCUIT,BECAUSE THE BING IS A SI THTHE ENARGY IS FLOWING WIIRCUS
4784,HI,FIVE
4785,BYE,FIVE
4786,PROBABLY BUT WE'D EITHER HAVE TO CUT A WIRE IN HALF OR GET RID OF ONE WIRE AND GET TWO SHORTER ONES,THE LBUG EAR  WRAO TS
4787,GOOD,
4788,WHAT DO YOU MEAN,
4789,CAUSE UM THAT ONE'S MADE OF ONE'S MADE OF PLASTIC AND ONE'S MADE OF WOOD ONE'S MADE OF METAL PROBABLY THE METAL IS THE HEAVIEST THE PL THEN THE WOOD THEN THE PLASTIC,BECAUS WE PUED RST JUST TO S  ALLOMOR THEN THE OTHERS

5594,I CAN'T REALLY REMEMBER,I CA ROLLY REMAMBERT
5595,UM GOOD WE GOT MORE THAN THE ONES THAT JUST STAYED IN THE CORNER AND STARTED TO SINK TO THE SIDE AND,GOOD WE  R TE THO JUSTED IN THE COURNER AND STARTED SAK SIDE
5596,UM WELL W THERE WASN'T THAT MANY OTHER THAN THE HEIGHT AND THE MASS THOSE WERE THE ONLY VERY BIG VARIABLES AND WE WE DIDN'T REALLY DO ANY MORE,THEAR WAS IN'T THAT MENE OTHER THIN THE HIT IN THE MALY  BIG VBWE DID'T REALLY JW ENY MOAR
5597,YEAH,
5598,MAYBE,MABE
5599,WELL THIS ONE HOLDS MORE,WILL THIS ON HOLD AER
5600,IS THIS THING ON RIGHT,
5601,OH UM WELL I THINK THE DIFFERENCE IS THAT IF YOU ALREADY HAVE THE PENNIES WHERE YOU WANNA PLACE THEM THEN THE MASS IS LIKE UM IT'S LIKE NOT AS BIG SORTA,I TINK THE JIPION IS  HAVE P   E TUMIN THE MALIK A  STE
5602,AND WE GOT IT UP TO FIFTY,ND WE GUTHER UP TO FIFTY
5603,IS THERE LIKE SOMETHING I CAN HEAR MYSELF IN,IAR LIKE SOM THING THET CAN HARD MY SELF IN
5604,I GUESS THE HIGHER ONE MIGHT SINK FASTER,ETHE HIHER WOND S SING FASTUR
5605,WELL WE WE JUST PLACED THE PENNIES IN ALL DIFFERENT CORNERS,WE'E JUST PLASED APANYS IN ALL FRNT COURNERES
5606,E I THINK I DID IT WRONG BECAUSE I THINK I STARTED I THINK I STARTED THE RIGHT WAY BUT THEN I THOUGHT I HAD TO DO IT DOWN HERE SO,I THINK  ISN'T RONG BECAS I THNK I STARTED I THINK I STARTED THE RW
5607,I GUESS IT IF EVERYBODY WOULD JUST GO ONE TWO OR ONE TWO THREE FOUR THE THE WHOLE THING WOULDN'T BE LIKE THAT ANYMORE,E EVERY BOY WIL JUST GO TON RORTHE THHOLL THING WILDNT BE LIKE OR
5608,SAY THAT WAS TWENTY FIVE AND THEN FOR TWO FIFTEEN I WOULD I WOULD I WOULD PROBABLY END UP,BTWT FIVEN TEN FOR TWO FIFTEN VDA UN OLLN
5609,UM YES BUT UM OUR TEACHER HAD US COUNT ALL TOGETHER LIKE LIKE I HAVE SHOWN YOU THE WHOLE CYCLE,Y AR TEATCIR HAD  OWNE ALL T GETHER
5610,YES EVEN THE TWO HUNDRED FIFTEEN THE HUNDRED THE NINETY FIVE THE ME,EVEN THE TWO HONDERED FIFTEN THE HUNDERED THNIN FIVE THM
5611,SORRY,
5612,MMM THE TWO FIFTEEN WOULD MAKE ABOUT,FIFTY
5613,YEAH,
5614,YEAH,YELLOW
5615,UM I FOR THE THIRTY EIGHT OR THE DIFFERENT LENGTH,FTHTHIRT EIGHT O THA DIFRENT LAMTES
5616,THE SHORTER SWINGS UH SWING MORE TIMES THAN THE UM LONGER ONES,THE SHIRT PINGS  SWIN FOR TIME TE LONON
5617,YOU WOULD PROBABLY GET SEVENTEEN,GET SEVENTY
5618,YEAH,
5619,YEAH,
5620,THE NUMBERS OF THE S YOUR YOUR SWINGS AND THEN THESE NUMBERS ARE THE NUMBER OF YOUR LENGTH,THEAS NUMBERES A A NUMBER OF YOUR ANS
5621,AND THE THE TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTEEN STRING WITH THE PAPER CLIP AND A PENNY IT GOT FIVE,TWO HONDRED AND FIFTEN SANG WITH THE PABER CLOF A N GT FIVE
5622,SO LIKE THE UH WITH ONE PENNY THE TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTEEN WOULD STILL GET FIVE,R LKE TH ONE PWO HNDER FIFTEN I FIVE
5623,YEAH,
5624,WELL WE DID TRY UM I THINK TWO DAYS AGO UH EVERYBODY GOT A DIFFERENT UM LENGTH AND THEN SHE GAVE US THE TWO MORE PENNIES AND UM THAT DIDN'T SEEM TO CHANGE,WEWE DIDN'T TRY I THINK TWO DACSE EVERY BODY  H GIVES THE TW PNETHAT DIDN'T SM TO CHANGE
5625,AND THEN,L
5626,THIRTY EIGHT,THURTYEIGHT
5627,YOU WOULD YOU WOULD FIND YOUR LENGTH CAUSE EVERYBODY GOT THEIR OWN AND YOU WOULD FIRST FIND YOURS SO FOR MINE,YOU WLL FIND YUR LENGTS CAUS EVERY BODY CAUGHT EI ON YO WILL FRST FIND OUR SIVER I
5628,UM I GUESS WE JUST I I DON'T REALLY UNDERSTAND THE QUESTION,I GES WE JUST  NR CASTION
5629,ALL THE WAY UP TO TWENTY FIVE AND IT WAS A GRAPH LIKE THIS,'LL RE ET TWENTY FIVE D S A GRAFF LKE THIS
5630,RIGHT RIGHT MMM HMM,I
5631,OR,LURE
5632,CAN I HEAR MYS,TREASURE
5633,UM SORRY,IM
5634,THAT WELL THE TWO HUN AND FIFTEEN WAS DANGLING FROM HERE KINDA JUST GOING LIKE THIS AND THEN MINE WAS GOING,B TW OND FIFTTE WITH STAN FROM AK THINE WI GO IN
5635,HOW MANY SWINGS YOU'VE GOTTEN AND THEN ON THIS SIDE YOU WOULD WRITE DOWN YOUR LENGTH AND HOW MANY SWINGS YOU GOT,HO MONEY SWINGS YOUVE GAUGHT YO L RIT DOW YOUR LENGTH HO MONEY SETINGS YOU
5636,SO IF THAT WAS THE LENGTH THEN,SRTHAT WAS THE EN E
5637,YES,GEST
5638,UM WE'VE BEEN WORKING WITH SWINGERS UM A PENDULUM,BEON WARING WITH S
5639,LIKE UM OUR FLIP STICK IS A POPSICLE STICK AND THERE'S SIX CENTIMETERS ON IT UNTIL THESE TWO COME IN SO IT'S LIKE ONE TWO THREE FOUR FIVE SIX,LK RB STI  THESX SEVEN MEATORS EL TH TWO COMON ONE TWO THREE FOURSIX
5640,CAUSE THAT'S THE ONLY WAY YOU CAN GET YOUR RESULT,ECUSTHATS ONLY W  GET
5641,FOR EACH INCH SO LIKE FOR SIX INCHES WE DID FOUR TIMES AND THEN WE DIVIDED IT BY FOUR CAUSE WE DID IT FOUR TIMES AND THEN WE GOT OUR RESULTS,FU ELT FO SIXWE D FOUR TIMES  TH VATED BI FOUR CAUS W IDN'T FOUR TIMS ARESALTS
5642,YEAH YEAH EVERYBODY DOES FOUR TRIALS ON EACH CENTIMETER,IEVERY BONDY OASE FOUR ES UCH SIMATOR
5643,OH OH WE MOST OF THE TIME WE MAKE IT HIT TO THE LIKE THIS PART ALL THE WAY DOWN TO THE THE NEXT,WEV MOST THE TIME W A   O THE PARARTH WAY DOWN TH THENEXT
5644,TWENTY,TWENTY
5645,BY FOUR,IFOUR
5646,THE MORE FAR IT'S OUT IT GO THE ALUMINUM BALL GOES HIGHER AS IN LIKE IT UH THAT WE'RE WE'RE HAVING A MEASURING TAPE AND SOMETIMES IT GOES HIGHER THAN THE LIMIT,GO THE ALLUMON B GOWIS HIGHER AS R HAVING A MAS SOM TIMS I GOS HIGHER THN THLEMET
5647,YEAH UM LIKE WE KINDA DID TWO VARIABLES BUT IT'S COMING TOGETHER AS ONE SO WE'RE SEEING HOW FAR IN OR OUT THE STICK IS AND HOW IT AFFECTS THE BALL,WE COUTTA TWOE VERRBLES P THE MNG  THONEOU SING AF AR IN YOUR EL TICKS  AWET THW
5648,YEAH,YELLOW
5649,IT'S LIKE UM IT'S HOW FAR THE STICK IS SO TOTAL THE STICK IS TOTAL SIX INCHES SO WE KEEP PUSHING IT IN AND IN IN MORE AND MORE,EHOW AR THE STICK THE STICK IS TOA SI INCSWPUSH
5650,WELL BECAUSE THE WEIGHT IF IT'S LIKE FORTY CENTIMETERS IT'LL DEFINITELY CHANGE EVERYTHING BUT TEN AND TWENTY AREN'T THAT FAR AWAY BUT IF IT WAS LIKE FORTY FROM TEN THAT WOULD MAKE A HUGE DIFFERENCE,K FOURTY SEVEN MATERS I ENTCHAGE EVRY THINGBUT TEN IN TWENTY AAFORTY FROM TEN THAK A  RN

7069,THEY DON'T GET FOOD THEY MAKE THEIR OWN AND IF THEY MAKE THEIR OWN THAT MEANS FROM THE SUN,THEY DON'T GET  MKS THER HMAK THER N HAT MANS FROM THE SUN
7070,THAT IS A PLANT IT NEEDS ENERGY FROM LIGHT OR THE SUN TO SURVIVE,A  A PLAN ENARGY FROM LIT FOR THE S TO SERVIVE

7074,GET FOOD FROM THE SUN,BRD FROM THE SN
7075,IT DOES NOT NEED A HOUSE SO IT ACTUALLY DOES NOT NEED TO GO IN THE HOUSE IT HAS TO STAY OUTSIDE THE HOUSE,IT DOES NOT LEAVE A HOS AO DOES NOT SA GO STA OUT SIDE THE HOUSE
7076,THAT MEANS IT HAS A BUNCH OF SUNLIGHT SO IT COULD GROW,THAT MNHAS A PLUSHSGROW
7077,IT CONNECTS TO THE WAY IT LOOKS BECAUSE IF IT DOESN'T HAVE SUNLIGHT IT DOESN'T GROW WELL IT GROWS BUT JUST NOT VERY FAST,I ONEXT TO THE AVE BECAS DESSM SN ARMLY GROWS BJUST NOT VERY FAST
7078,HAVE DIDN'T HAVE YELLOW LEAVES AND THIS PLANT HAS YELLOW LEAVES AND THE OTHER PLANTS DIDN'T HAVE A YELLOW STEM AND THIS PLANT HAS A YELLOW STEM,P A YELLO BES IN THS PLAN HAS EO LEESTHEOTHER  YELLOW STAVIN THS SW HAS  EAM
7079,IT HAS TO DO LIKE WATER GOES ONTO SOMETHING AND PLANTS NEED WATER TO SURVIVE,IT HAS WATER GOWS ON TO SOMTHING  PLAN NEA WATER TO SIRVIVE
7080,THAT THOSE ARE ONLY SINGLE CELLS SO THAT MAKES IT YEAST,THAT TOES AR ONLY A SINGLL SELL STHATMAKS I
7081,I THINK IT IS BECAUSE THEY DON'T I MEAN THEY DO NEED WATER TO SURVIVE OR ELSE IT WON'T GROW AT ALL,I THINK IS BECAS THE I MEA THE MNEO WATER TO SIRVVE ZBERO
7082,YES THEY DO MAKE THEIR FOOD AND THIS IS HOW FROM THE SUN,YETH  MAKS A RUD N THI WFROM THE
7083,DOESN'T HAVE ANY LIGHT,VI
7084,BECAUSE THAT IS THE SUNS ENERGY I MEAN THAT IS THE PLANT'S ENERGY TO GROW SO THAT'S WHY,BECAUSE THAT IS  SN INARGERYSRI MENE THAT IS A PLN OW
7085,BECAUSE IT IT IS KIND OF TALL,BECAUSE IS IND M
7086,THE COOKIE IS BECOMING YEAST,THE CURK IS BECAUM
7087,BYE,FIV
7088,CAUSE THEY NEEDED TO SURVIVE SO IF THEY DON'T HAVE WATER THEY WON'T SURVIVE,BECAUS THEY MEDD TO SIRVIE STHNT HAVE WATER THY T SERVIVE
7089,DON'T NEED IT BECAUSE IT'S JUICE AND YOU DON'T NEED PLANTS DON'T NEED JUICE TO SURVIVE,DON'T MEA BECAS JUICE  DON'T MPLANS TON'T EJUICE TO SZERV
7090,TO WATER PLANTS AND HOW THEY GET THEIR ENERGY AND HOW THEY TRANSFORM FROM A SEED FROM A SEED TO A PLANT,WATER PLANS I  VA THEIR ENERGRY   TRANS FORM FROM THE SE FROM THE S TO A PLANT
7091,NO I CAN NOT THINK OF ANYTHING ELSE,I CNOT THINK OF NEY THING EALCE
7092,THAT'S YEAST IS LITTLE CHEMICAL THAT SOMETIMES GOES INTO BREAD,TLDEL CAMCLW TSOME TIMES GOWS IN THE BRAD
7093,YES I THINK IT DOES NEED AIR SO THAT WAY IT CAN STILL GROW BUT IF IT DOESN'T HAVE AIR IT WON'T GROW,YET I THINK IT DOES MEATS ASO THAT WA T CAN STLL GROW DOESN GROW
7094,I OBSERVE LITTLE CHEMICALS INSIDE THE YEAST AND I THINK THAT IS THE YEAST,ZERPLA CANM B COLTH INSIDE THE EAST TNK THAT IS THE T
7095,NEED SUNLIGHT AND ROOTS AND WATER AND THAT IS IT,Y NEES SUN LITS ARU WATER I THD
7096,I SEE A HAMBURGER,I
7097,THE YELLOW GRASS DOESN'T HAVE ANY LIGHT AND THE GREEN GRASS HAS A BUNCH OF LIGHT,THE YELLOW GAS DOES NT HAVE Y LIGHT  THE GREEN GAS HAS  BU
7098,THEY GET THEIR OWN FOOD BECAUSE THIS IS HOW IT GETS THEIR FOOD FROM THE SUN,WEGET  D BECAS THIIS T BIRD FROM THE SI
7099,THAT IT IS GOING TO EXPLODE,THAT IS GOIN TO EXPLOONS
7100,THEY NEED ALL THAT STUFF TO GROW,NEA ALL THET STMPES TO GROW
7101,NOPE NOTHING,NOTHING
7102,PLANTS NEED AIR TO SURVIVE SO IF IT DOESN'T HAVE ANY AIR OR OXYGEN IT WON'T SURVIVE,LANS LEAES ACHAKE ERVSIRDOESN'T HAVE ANE AIO SOSIONE
7103,IT MEANS TO BE A CARNIVORE THAT YOU ONLY EAT SO LIKE A LION EAT CAN EAT A POLAR BEAR AND IT'S MEAT AND THE POLAR BEAR CAN EAT A LION AND MEAT AND THE MEAT CAN'T EAT ANYTHING,IT MIS TBE A CA THONLY SO LIKE ALONEAT A LBRO N MATIN A BRO ALING
7104,THEY ARE ALL LIVING SYSTEMS,THE AR AL LIVING CISTOMS
7105,WE HAVE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT UM LIVING SYSTEMS,WE HAVE BIN LEARNING ABOUT LIVING CISTAMAS
7106,THEY ARE LIVING ORGANISMS SO AND THEY ARE ALSO DECOMPOSER THEY CAN DECOMPOSE OTHER THINGS AND THEMSELVES,THEY A LVING ORGANIZOMNE IN VAY AAL SO TE COMPSERTHA CAN DE COMP OTHER THINGS IN THEMSELVES
7107,TO BE A DECOMPOSER YOU ARE YOU ONLY IT ONLY I FORGOT,TO BEATH THA COMPOUSER YOW RYOU N I ON L EVER THA

7109,WHAT IS YOUR NAME,WISUA
7110,THAT IS A HARD QUESTION BUT I THINK THEY GET THEIR ENERGY FROM THE SUN LIKE PRODUCERS,THAT IS A ARDCSINHE INAGERY FROM THE SUN LIKE PRDEAUCEA
7111,THAT THEY'RE PICTURES OF WHAT EATS THEM AND WHAT THEY EAT,THTHEIR PICTURES ATS THEM IN
7112,THAT YOU HAVE TO EAT OTHER ANIMALS TO SURVIVE,YOU HA TO EAT OTHER NAMALES TO SIRVIVE
7113,THINK THE PRODUCERS ARE GRASS PINE TREES AND THE MUSHROOMS AND THE ALGAE,I THINK THE BRDAR GRM THE MOUSOMES IN THE ELOGY
7114,THE SCRAPS SHRUNK SO THAT MEANS THE RED WORMS DECOMPOSED,THE SATRUK SO THAT MEANS TH RAD WORM DE COMPOSE
7115,I THINK THIS IS ALL ABOUT LIVING SYSTEMS AND HOW THEY GET THEIR ENERGY AND SOME OF THEM GET THEIR ENERGY FROM THE SUN,I THINK THIS IS ALEBOUTLVING ITOMS  ET HER ENARGYSOMENE THEME GAT THER ENAGY FROM THE SOUN
7116,IT MEANS THAT YOU ONLY EAT PLANTS,IT MENTHET YOUN ONLY EAT PLANTS
7117,LIKE A FOOD WEB OR A FOOD CHAIN AND WHAT THEY EAT AND WHAT EATS THEM,LIK  E WAE B   EAT  TAM
7118,IT MAKES THEM DECOMPOSERS,IT MAKS DE COMPOSURES
7119,BECAUSE THEY BELONG LIKE SOME FISH EATS ALGAE THAT SO IT'S KINDA LIKE THAT,BECAUS THEAY BE LONG IKE SM I ELOGYH SLEINT LIKE THAT
7120,BECAUSE IT IS A LIVING ORGANISM,BCAL M
7121,THEY EAT GRASS,GRASS
7122,I DON'T THINK THEY EAT ANYTHING THEY JUST GET THEIR ENERGY FROM THE SUN,DON'T THINK AN INGJUST GTS HE INERGY FROM S
7123,BEING A PRODUCER MEANS THEY GET THEIR ENERGY FROM THE SUN,IDUSR T THER INAGRY FROM THE SN
7124,BY EATING OTHER ANIMALS,BI EATING OTHER ANAMALES
7125,WE HAVE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT LIVING ORGANISMS,WE LRINBOUT LIVING ORGANIZAMS
7126,IT'S BECAUSE IT GETS IT'S ENERGY FROM THE SUN AND IT'S KINDA LIKE BEING A HERBIVORE,BECAS ITIVES INAGRY FROM THE S IND O LE BING R

7132,WHAT IS MEANS TO BE AN OMNIVORE IS THAT YOU EAT BOTH MEAT AND PLANTS,IT MENS TO BE ABS TYOU AT BOTH MT AND PLANTS
7133,THIS IS ABOUT PRODUCERS CONSUMERS AND DECOMPOSERS,PRDUSEAR UMORS I DE COMPSERES
7134,A DECOMPOSER IS LIKE A I DON'T KNOW,THE  COMPLUSER IS EI DON'T
7135,DECOMPOSER IS EAT EITHER PLANTS OR DEAD ANIMALS DECOMPOSING,THE COMPUSOR IS EATHER PLANT E  OR ET AMAL DE COMPSIN

7827,YOU DO THE BEST YOU CAN WITH THEM,YOUL DU THE BEST YOU CAN WITH THM
7828,GOOD,OD
7829,WELL YOU COULD DECIDE WHAT PROCEDURE YOU'RE DOING ON WHAT MAKES IT EASY OR UM HARDER IF YOU WANT A CHALLENGE,YOU AN TPROSEAZUR YOUR EWING ON AKS THE EAS HARD CHALLONGE
7830,SO UM YOU COULD HAVE MORE DATA AND IT WOULD MAKE THE PROJECT BETTER,SIRYOU CALN HAVE OT WL MIK THE PROCT BTER
7831,YOU CAN FIGURE OUT UM HOW MANY PENNIES GO IN THE DIFFERENT SIZES OF BOATS,YOU CAN HME PANEIS GO IN THE DIFRNT SIES BOKS
7832,WELL TO HAVE A CONTROLLED EXPERIMENT YOU YOU HAVE TO KEEP ALL THE THINGS THE SAME EXCEPT ONE,AVE A ROLD XPYO HAV  P LL THE TINGS THE SAME EXEPT ONE
7833,THEY HAVE TO MAKE SURE IT'S ONLY ONE VARIABLE AND THEY THEY DON'T ACCIDENTLY MESS UP AND UM MAKE THE WATERS LIKE WAVE CRAZY,THEY HAVE TO MAK SURE ONLY ONE VERIB DTMAKE ATERIKE GR
7834,I DON'T GET HOW TO ANSWER THAT QUESTION,DON'T GET HO TO ANSER THAT CESTION
7835,YEAH,
7836,THIS HAS TO DO WITH THE STANDARD PROCEDURE BECAUSE IT HAS TO STAY BALANCED OTHERWISE YOU WON'T GET THE RIGHT DATA,WITH A STANDERT ESEIZBECAS SA BANCED OTHER WISE YOU DON'T GET THE T
7837,ONLY ONE,LYONE

7843,THAT UM THE BOATS WERE ALL DIFFERENT SIZES,THE BOTS OURF DIFRENT ISES
7844,YEAH,YELLOW
7845,CUP A COLLECTED THE MOST UM THE MOST WATER BECAUSE IT'S THE BIGGEST CUP,COLLECTED THE MOST TH OS WATER BECAUSE IS THE BIGB
7846,THAT THE BIGGER THE BOAT IS THE MORE PASSENGERS IT CAN HOLD,THE BI TPASONDERESCAN HOLD
7847,THE WATER IN THE BOAT CAN GET PRETTY HIGH,THE WATER IN THE BOT CAN GET VEY
7848,YOU HAD TO MAKE SURE THAT THE PENNIES WENT IN BALANCE SO THAT THE BOAT WON'T TIP OVER AND SINK,YO'VE HAD TO MAKE SURE THEPANEYS WEIN BHE TERTINK
7849,THEY UM PUT UH THEY THE EACH BOAT IS A DIFFERENT SIZE AND THEY PUT ONE PENNY IN AT A TIME,TE THETHE EACH BOT IS DIFR SIS ND THEY PU ONE PANY IN TE TIME
7850,THEY CHANGED THE SIZE OF THE BOAT AND,THEY CHANGED  SIS OTHE ON
7851,YOU HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT EVERY VARIABLE IS THE SAME EXCEPT ONE,W HAE TO MIURE TH EVERY VERRBTHE SAME XEPT ONE
7852,IT RELATES CAUSE I KNOW HOW MUCH UM WELL HOW BIG THE CUP WAS BUT I DIDN'T KNOW HOW MUCH WATER IT COULD HOLD,LT BECAUS I NEW H MUH BIGPNTNO HMH WATERTOLD
7853,WE'RE STILL WORKING ON THE BOATS WI WITH PENNIES AND UM THE OTHER THINGS,U SILVER CING ON THE BOTS WWITH MANEY OM THE OTHER THINGS
7854,YES,UGGEST
7855,YEAH,R
7856,EACH TIME A PENNY GETS PUT IN THE BOAT SINKS A LITTLE,EACH TIME  PANY IN THE BOTSINS L
7857,WE KEPT ALL THE VARIABLES THE SAME EXCEPT ONE,WE CPTD AL THE VERIBLLES THE SAME XEPT ONE
7858,UM SLOWER OR FASTER DEPENDING ON HOW MUCH WEIGHT,BASTROH
7859,THERE IS ONE REALLY LONG ONE THERE IS ONE MEDIUM ONE AND A REALLY SHORT ONE,RLY  MEATI LH

7861,SO YOU CAN SEE WHICH WAY IT WORKS BETTER,SIR YOU CAN SEEWCH AY WS BTER
7862,IT HAS WEIGHT AT THE BOTTOM,HAS WAT THE BOTTOM
7863,IT GOES ALL THE WAY UP ON ONE SIDE THEN TO THE OTHER SIDE AND THEN BACK AGAIN,G LHE WAY UPON ONSIDE TO THE OTHER SIDE BA
7864,IN SCIENCE WE ARE LEARNING HOW TO COLLECT DATA,INSIDE  W ARE LRNING TO COLLET ATEM
7865,IT GOES BACK AND FORTH REALLY FAST,BA ORHELLY FAST
7866,DEPENDING HOW MUCH PENNIES ARE ON THERE IT WOULD GO SLOWER OR FASTER,MUCH PNYS ARE ON TWLGO LBERAST
7867,SO YOU,
7868,THEY ALL HAD THE SAME NUMBER OF SWINGS,ETHE SAME NUMBER OF TWA
7869,HI,FIVE
7870,THE STRING IS HANGING ON SOMETHING AND IT GOES BACK AND FORTH A FEW TIMES UNTIL IT STOPS SLOWS DOWN,THE STRING IS HANGING ON SOMTHING IN GO BACK IN FOR A FEW TIMES W
7871,WE SEE WHAT CHANGED EACH TIME WE DID SOMETHING,SE WTCHATIME WE DI OMTHIN
7872,WELL THERE HAS TO BE SOME SORT OF WEIGHT AT THE BOTTOM SO THAT IT CAN SWING OTHERWISE IT WOULD JUST BE TOO LIGHT,THEAR HAS TB SOME SORTAT THE BOTOM O TIT CN SWNG OTHERWISE T LATE
7873,IT'S GOING GOOD HOW ABOUT YOU,GOIN BOUT YOU
7874,EACH ONE HAS A DIFFERENT AMOUNT OF PENNIES ON IT,EAHONE HAS A DIFRMOT OF P
7875,IT'S IN A PAPERCLIP HANGING FROM A STRING,PAPER CLIF HANGING FROM THE STRIN
7876,PENDULUMS ARE THINGS THAT LIKE HANG FROM SOMETHING UM AND THEY CAN SWING BACK AND FORTH,SENLOA THING TH AFROM SOM SWIN FOURT
7877,YOU COULD CHANGE HOW HIGH IT'S HANGING,YOU CAN SEACE SO H IN
7878,WE MADE LITTLE LIFEBOATS AND UM AND THEN WE LIKE PUT PENNIES IN IT FOR THE PEOPLE AND SEE HOW MANY PEOPLE COULD GO IN BEFORE IT SANK,WE MA  LIFE BOTS IN THE K UT ANS IN TFORPEOPLE A SEA HO MONEY PEOPLE CAN GO IN FOURITTINK
7879,GOOD,GOD
7880,THE BOAT WOULD START TO TIP OVER AND KIND OF START TO GO DOWN IN THE WATER,THE BOT STARTTNDOWN THE WATER
7881,THEY HAD TO BE THREE CENTIMETERS LONG,HAD THREE SEVEN MATERS ALONG
7882,WE USED THE DIXIE CUPS AND LIKE CUT UM AROUND IT TO MAKE IT SMALLER SO THAT I DON'T REALLY KNOW OH SO IT WOULD LIKE BALANCE,YOU SO DI CUS IN  UNROUN THE TO MAKE  SMOLLER UNI E BALONCS
7883,UM THE ONE ON THE LEFT SIDE IS BALANCED UPRIGHT AND THEN THE ONE ON THE RIGHT SIDE IS ABOUT TO SINK CAUSE IT'S UNBALANCED,THEON ON THE LEFT SIDE IS UPRT  ON THE RIT SIDE IS ARBOUT TO TINK ALION
7884,EACH ONE IS A DIFFERENT SIZE,ECH WON IS A DIFRENT SS
7885,IT MIGHT AFFECT THE NUMBER OF PASSENGERS BECAUSE IF THE WATER'S GOING ALL CRAZY THEN IT COULD CAUSE THAT CUP TO FLIP OVER,MIGHT ETECT TE NOUMBER OF PASTRS BCAS WATER IS GOING ZI TH ER
7886,YOU NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU ALL UM THAT YOU PUT THE PENNIES IN EACH LIFEBOAT AT THE SAME HEIGHT AND LIKE NOT ALL AT THE SAME TIME LIKE ONE AT A TIME FOR EACH ONE,OU MEAS MAK SURE THT YOU ATH YOU PUT  AN IN A FLIFE THE SAME N NTHE SAME TIMETIME
7887,THEY'RE JUST DROPPING IT IN AND THAT CAUSES THE BOAT TO GET MORE PRESSURE PUT ON IT SO IT FALLS DOWN BEFORE THE LEFT SIDE DOES,TUTH PSDOWNORTE LETSIDE
7888,YOU WOULD PUT THE UM CUP IN THE WATER AND THEN UH PUT ONE PENNY IN AT A TIME TO SEE HOW LONG IT TOOK BEFORE IT SANK,HE WIL PUT THE MUP IN THE WATER  PUT ONE PNO A TIME TO S AOLONFORIX
7889,UM YOU GOT TO MAKE SURE THERE'S NO WATER IN THE BOAT OR ELSE UM OR OR ELSE IT COULD CAUSE THE BOAT TO GO DOWN MORE THAN IT WOULD IF THERE WAS NO NO WATER IN THE CUP,YOU GAU A MITURE THWATER I M COST HE BTO DOWN WWATER
7890,THEY PUT SO MUCH ON ONE SIDE THAT THAT SIDE JUST SUNK WITHOUT GETTING MORE IN,THEY PUT SO MUCH ON ONESIDE TH THSIDE WITH  G
7891,GETTING FROM ONE PLACE TO ANOTHER IN WATER,SIFROM ONEPLAST TO AN NOTHER WATER
7892,EACH TIME YOU PUT A PENNY IN IT SUNK A LITTLE BIT MORE,A TIME YOUP  NY
7893,THE MORE PENNIES AND THERE'S MORE PENNIES IN THE TALLER ONE AND IN THE CUP A,THE THERTS MOUR PANYS IN THE T  T PA
7894,WE'VE BEEN UM MAKING LITTLE LIFEBOATS AND USING PENNIES AS PEOPLE AND DROPPING THEM IN AND SEEING HOW LONG IT TOOK FOR THE LIFEBOAT TO SINK IN WATER,WE MAKING L LIFE BOATS  YOUSING PANEYS  PEOPLE  OGH THLIFE BOAT TO SINGN WATER
7895,WELL IF IT'S IF IT'S A BIGGER UM CUP THEN IT COULD PROBABLY FIT MORE PENNIES IN BEFORE IT SINKS,IT A BIGEROUT IOO EN  HFOURSINX
7896,SO IT DOESN'T MESS UP YOUR EXPERIMENT,SR DOESN'T LI UTHE XPEMIENT
7897,GROUP D HAS THE MOST PENNIES,SCRUPE HAS T PNES
7898,YOU HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU ONLY CHANGE ONE THING OR ELSE THAT YOU WON'T KNOW THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN OTHER THINGS THAT YOU DO CAUSE IT WOULD MESS UP THE EXPERIMENT,HAVE TO MAK SURE THLY CHANGE ONE YOU DON'T NE THE DIFRENS BETWEEN XPERIMIONTS
7899,THEY GOT A A LOT MORE PENNIES IN THE LEFT SIDE CAUSE THEY PUT IT IN MORE CAREFULLY,TH ORPANYS ON THE ESIDE TY P CARFULY
7900,YOU NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT EACH CUP IS EXACTLY THREE CENTIMETERS OR ELSE IT COULD CAUSE UM A BIG DIFFERENCE BETWEEN ONE CUP AND ANOTHER,I K SURE THE S Z THREE SEVEN MEADORES ZERO BIGIFRNS BETWEEN ONE CUPNOTHER
7901,NOTHING,NOTHING
7902,IT HAD TO BE SMALL TO FIT IN THE TOP OF WATER,HAD  SMOLLE TFIT IN THE TUBWATER
7903,YOU CAN UM CHANGE THE THE HEIGHT OF THE CUP AND IT CAN HOLD MORE PENNIES THAT WAY,YOU CAN CHANGE THE THE HAT OF  COP IT AN HOLD YOUR PANEAT WAY
7904,THERE'S MORE IN THE LEFT SIDE BECAUSE THEY STACKED IT EVENLY SO IT COULD BALANCE BETTER,THAW LE SI BECAUSE THE AEVE ATER
7905,FLOAT,TOW

8444,BECAUSE THE SWITCH IS,BECAUSE THE SLEA OS OTTUS
8445,IT BREAKS,ATE
8446,I SEE THAT LIGHT BULB IS NOT WORKING BECAUSE THE SWITCH IS IN ON IS LIKE HOLDING THE ELECTRICITY IS GOING THROUGH LIGHT BULB,I SE THPIS BECAUSE SEAR AN  E COLD  THEETSIONO

8462,LIGHT BULB GROW SO IT DOESN'T WORK SO THAT IT HAS TO BE DIFFERENT ANOTHER,
8463,MAY BE BECAUSE IT'S GETTING TOO MUCH LIGHT,RED BY BECAUS IS TING TOO MUCHLIT
8464,YOU KNOW THAT IS,T
8465,WE KNOW THAT THERE IS A BATTERY THAT THIS THREE WIRES THERE IS A SWITCH,WE DON'TKTHEA A BAE TH RES SW

8482,WE'VE BEEN LEARNING HOW TO COMPLETE A CIRCUIT,WE'VE BLERING HAD A COMPLEET CIRC
8483,SO,SO
8484,INSULATORS ARE HELPFUL,EMPLOYEDERES AU HELPE FUL
8485,ITS STARTS TO MOVE BECAUSE IT'S LIKE LIKE HAPPY ITS ENERGY,IT STARTED TO BECAUSE S THE HAP TINGY
8486,I SEE THAT THE MOTOR IS MOVING BECAUSE WHEN I PUT THE PAPER CLIP ON TOP OF THE SWITCH IT STARTED TO MOVE,T THE DIS MOVING BECAS WHPT STARTED TVE
8487,BECAUSE IT'S NOT A SOURCE OF ELECTRICITY OR A PIECE OF ENERGY,BECAUS ITS NOT  SORT  A OR PESE OF NEO
8488,GOOD,ED
8489,THE MOTOR IS MOVING ITS LITTLE FLAG BECAUSE THE SWITCH IS TURNED ON,THEMIS EASING TIS F FA BECASE THE SWITRN
8490,THE CIRCUIT WILL RUN BECAUSE IT IS LIKE ITS METAL AND IN ORDER FOR IT TOWARDS THAT NEEDS METAL,THE IRUS W ON BECAUSE K AA AOERFORTO
8491,ALL INSIDE IT AND THEN IT WANT,SATER IN ENEW
8492,I MEAN THAT IS NOT GETTING ENERGY BECAUSE THE SWITCH IS AT ON AND THE WOOD STICK IS LIKE ISN'T A TYPE OF METAL SO IT WON'T WORK,THAT MENSDAS NOT ET A ENERGY BECAUS THEWEAH IS AN N THE DSTICKAKEIPE METOE R
8493,CONDUCTING MATERIALS ARE HELPFUL BUT THE REST OF THAT AREN'T WHERE IT'S TO OTHER WAY OVER CAN YOU TELL THAT MARNIE,CONDUCTING MATERIALE OR HELPE FTHE BREST THE AOU
8494,THAT WHEN YOU PUT THE WOOD ON THE WOOD STICK IT IS NOT WORKING ANYMORE BECAUSE IT'S NOT TYPE OF METAL OR ITS TYPE OF SOURCE TO MAKE IT,THEWHEN YOU PUT THI H D STICK IS IRING Y MORBECAUSOR
8495,IT DOESN'T WORK BECAUSE IT'S NOT LIKE STORE OF ENERGY AND BECAUSE A BATTERY WORKS BECAUSE THAT HAS STORED ENERGY INSIDE IT SO,BECAS NO BECAUSE BTTERY WR BECAUS IT HAS  ENRGY INSIDE
8496,I SAID THAT YOU NEED A BATTERY WHICH HAS STORED ENERGY INSIDE IT AND THEN YOU NEED TWO WIRES A SWITCH AND A MOTOR,YOA BTUST STA ININSIDER TWO BIS SWT AER
8497,WELL I THINK THAT THE LIGHT THE DOTS ARE THE ENERGY AND LIKE THAT'S WAS JUST SPEAKING THE LIGHT BULB BRIGHTER,I THINK HE DOS ARE THE INARGYIUS W IER
8498,IT'S JUST TO BE IN A CIRCLE IS VERY HELPFUL BECAUSE THEY HAS BECAUSE THE BATTERY IS GIVING IN ENERGY TO THE D CELL THAT'S HOW THE LIGHT BULB IS GETTING THE ENERGY IMPROVEMENT,THE SON N THE CIRCUS IS VERY HOPE FUL BECAUS BECAUSE THE BUTTER IS NER E DEALLETHE FLBOL IS INERGRY
8499,I DON'T KNOW,OW
8500,THAT WHEN THOSE ONE LIGHT BULB IT JUST ONE FOCUS AND LIKE WHEN THERE IS A ONE BATTERY IT DOESN'T LIGHT AS MUCH AS THE SECOND ONE BECAUSE THERE IS TWO FOR EACH ONE,I JUST ONE WN THERIS ONE BAIT DOUESN'T LI S MUCH AS TH SN BECASE THEAR STH ONE
8501,ITS IT WAS THE LIGHT BULBS TURN BRIGHTER BECAUSE IT'S USING TWO BATTERIES AND SO THAT IS TWO STORED ENERGIES INTO LIGHT BULBS,T THE IE P TURND RITER BECAS ANS THE ARTIN S

8509,IT'S TO BE TOUCHING D CELL AND THE WIRES BECAUSE THE WIRES ARE GOING TO GAIN ENERGY AND BY THAT ONE IS GOING TO BE LIKE A REALLY FUN AND STUFF LIKE THAT SO JUST GET ON THE LAST PART,STB TUCH ING SALLNATORBECAUSE RL
8510,BECAUSE THEY NEEDS ANOTHER WIRE CONNECTING TO THE PLUS OF THE WIRES AND THERE ARE NOT SUPPOSED TO BE TOUCHING,BECAUSE IT MEAS A OTHER ATOR CONRCTG T THE THE WRE P

8512,MAY BE BECAUSE IF THE WIRES ARE THE BATTERY IS GIVING ENERGY TO THE WIRE AND THAT'S WHY THE LIGHT BULB IS SHINING AND ITS VERY VERY VERY VERY BRIGHT,MB BECAUSE IFTHE IOS THE BATER GIVING EY TOTHE WAERTATG IS SVERY ERY VERY
8513,HE IS A COMPLETE FORMAT FOR A LIGHT BULB TO WORK,IS A COMPLEET TORMENT FOR K

8789,THE CHARGES GO FROM THE NEGATIVE TO HERE THEN BACK TO THE BATTERY,THEY CHARE  RFROM THE NE  THE ER
8790,UM I DON'T KNOW,ON'T AV
8791,BECAUSE THERE'S NO WAY THEY CAN GET THROUGH THE THE THING,BECAUSE THS NOBO  GET THR THE THE SAME
8792,UM MMM I DON'T KNOW,NNME
8793,IT WOULDN'T MATTER THAT WOULD GO IT WOULD,A W THA ILO
8794,IT WON'T WORK CAUSE IT'S NOT CONNECTED TO THAT SO THAT MEANS THE F FLOWS WON'T BE ABLE TO GO UP AND OVER AND IN THE BATTERY,ECAUSE SNOT CONNECT THE T THAT MEINS THE FLOWS  ABEL TO GOOP PN
8795,THIS,
8796,YEAH,YEL
8797,HELLO,
8798,OH YEAH UH HUH YEAH,

8807,THE ENERGY STOPS FLOWING,THA TP
8808,YOU JUST PUT THEM TOGETHER,WE'VE JUST PUT THEM TO GEATHER
8809,I DIDN'T UNDERST,D
8810,WHAT WHY IS THAT YOUR FAVORITE QUESTION,WHY IS THET  CESTION
8811,IT SHOWS TWO LIGHT BULBS AND TWO BATTERIES,E H TO LIKE VLS IN TOO BATER
8812,YEP THAT'S RIGHT,YETDASERST
8813,NOW THERE'S MORE ENERGY,TABLES IAGY
8814,HOW THE ENERGY FLOWS THROUGH THEM,CILL THE ENAGY FWS  TAM
8815,STUCK UP PLEASE,TAO
8816,I KIND OF WORKED ON IT,
8817,OH ABOUT WHAT,ABOUTWT
8818,BECAUSE THE TWO POSITIVE SIDES ARE GOING TOGETHER,BECAUS THE T S SIS ARE GOYNG TO T
8819,LIKE WHAT,LI
8820,YEAH,
8821,WHEN I CLIPPED ON THE BATTERIES,I CL TON THE BATTER
8822,IT TELLS ME THE BULBS ARE LIGHTING UP BECAUSE OF THE ENERGY FLO IS FLO,TELLS ME THE BUS ARTTBECAUSE THE INERGY
8823,WHY IS THAT YOUR FAVORITE QUESTION,WHY IS THAT YOUR FVER CWESTION
8824,WHAT ELSE DO YOU WANT TO KNOW,W SHEO
8825,UM HMM THAT'S A HARD QUESTION UM IT IT CAN ON LIKE I SAID IT CAN ONLY FLOW FROM THE NEGATIVE TO THE POSITIVE,IT CAN SAIT CAN ONLY FLOW FROM THE NERDIM TO THE PABS
8826,WE PUT TWO BATTERIES ON TWO BULBS,WE HE PUT TOO AROS DN TOOS
8827,NO BUT I KNOW IT'S FLOWING CAUSE THE BULBS ARE LIGHTING UP,I NOT CASE THE BLS ARE WP
8828,HMM WE TRIED TO LIGHT UM A BULB TWO BULBS WITH ONE BATTERY,WE TRY TO LI A OB TOO BUPS ITH ONE BATTERI
8829,IT LIGHT DIMLY,DEIG
8830,ENERGY FLOWS IN THE BULB AND WA IT LIGHTS UP,IMAGRY FLOWS IN THE  SP
8831,TO MAKE THE ENERGY MORE EFFICIENT,TOTMAKE THE ENOAGY  PSH
8832,THE BATTERIES AND THE LIGHT BULBS,TH BATERS N THE LIFE  BOATS
8833,NO YOU CAN'T,UA
8834,THERE IS A MOTOR LIGHT BULB AND BATTERY,THE  ODA LIPE BTER
8835,WHAT TELL ME,ME
8836,CAN'T HAVE TWO POSITIVE ENDS OF A BATTERY TOGETHER,W EAT HAVE TOO   IN BATTER TO GEATHER
8837,WHAT,WHITE
8838,YEP,IP
8839,WE PUT TOGETHER THE BATTERIES THEN PUT THE WIRES ON THEN IT LIT UP,WE TO GATHERE THE BTENPUT THE I OLIUP
8840,WHAT ABOUT THAT,OBUTE
8841,WHAT DO YOU MEAN,MI
8842,GOOD,GOOD
8843,NOW YOU SEE THE ENERGY FLOWING,RFL
8844,THE ENERGY IS FLOWING THROUGH THE BULBS,THE IMERY IS FLOWION THRO THE BDAS
8845,THE ENERGY FLOWS THROUGH A WIRE GETTING IT REALLY REALLY HOT WHICH LI LIKE WHICH MAKES LIGHT,THE ENMARGERY FLOWS  BAER REALLY RALLY   IT
8846,IT'S THE LIGHT BULBS ARE TURNING OFF,THE  BL TRNTHE OFF
8847,WHAT,WHITE
8848,STOP,CBOGIC
8849,LIKE I SAID IT STOPS FLOWING,STOPS  LOWING
8850,CAUSE THE TWO BATTERIES HOLDS L THEY HOLD A LOT OF ENERGY PUT TOGETHER,BECAUS TWO BATER  THA  A NER Y PUT TO GEATHER
8851,I'VE BEEN SEEING HOW WAYS WE CAN PUT TWO LIGHT BULBS CONNECTED TO ONE BATTERY,SING AOWAS WE  PUT TO LIKE BALS CONLECTED ONE BATTER
8852,WE'VE UNDERSTOOD TWO POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE THING UM SIDES CAN'T GO TOGETHER,WE ARMED S TO   NEGRDAVE THINK SD CANT GO TO GEATHER

9039,UM WE ADDED MORE WELL WE HAD SPACERS AND WASHERS AS YOU KNOW AND WE PUT THE SPACERS BETWEEN THE MAGNETS AND THE WASHERS ON THE OTHER END,WE ADED WE HAD ASTIRE IN WASTHRS YO NOWD WE PUT THEA SPASES BETWEEN THE FRATSTHATHOTHETHER
9040,IT HAS TOO MANY WASHERS SO THAT THE MAGNETS LOSE THEIR MAGNETIC FIELD,IT HAS TWO MONY WATSE AT LESUREFIELD
9041,WE UM GROUP A GROUP B AND GROUP D HAVE THE SAME RESULTS CAUSE THEY PROBABLY DID THE SAME THING AND GROUP C HAS REALLY LOW UM,GRUP A RBION GUDE HAVE THE SAME REZLT BECAUSE TA RDED THE SAME TING AND GUMS S REALLY O
9042,GETTING FURTHER APART,IM ETNFRTHER APT
9043,WELL THEY HAD BETTER UM,THAE HAD BUTTER UMS
9044,YEAH BECAUSE THERE WAS SUCH A BIG DROP LIKE FROM NINETEEN NINE THAT'S TEN WASHERS SO TH THE SPACERS MUST HAVE A A LOT OF USE,BECAUSE T S SUCH A BIG FROM NINT TET NINE TWATSRS LOF YUICE
9045,THEY'RE STICKING TOGETHER,THE AR STICKY TO GATHERE
9046,I'M GOOD,I'MGOOD

9048,WE HAVE BEEN UM WE HAVE BEEN TESTING THE STRENGTH OF THE MAGNETS,WEVE HAVE BIN THEWE E TESTING THE STRINTH OF AITES
9049,MAGNETS GET FURTHER APART BECAUSE THE MORE UM SPACERS YOU PUT IN BETWEEN THE UM LESS ROOM THEY HAVE,FRIGE FRTHER APART BECAS THSPASES YOU PUT IN BETWEEN THMTHA HAVE
9050,THEY SHOULD DO THE SAME THINGS,THEY SHOULD DU THE SAME THINGS
9051,WASHERS WERE HEAVY AND THEY MADE THE MAGNETS LOSE THEIR STRENGTH,WT  EVY THEY MA AA  THARE STREINGS
9052,YEAH BECAUSE THEN IT WOULD KIND OF UM HIT THE CUP AND THEN THE MAGNETS WOULD KIND OF SEPARATE BECAUSE OF THE FORCE AND THEN THEY WOULD COME BACK TOGETHER,BECAUSE T UIT THE OB TH FA SEPERAT BEA THERE
9053,IT'S BROKEN BECAUSE UM THE WASHER'S THROWN IN THERE SO HARD THAT IT KIND OF FORCES THAT CUP DOWN AND THE OTHER CUP TO COME WITH THE MAGNET TO SEPARATE FROM THE OTHER MAGNET,IOKIN BECATHE WATE IS THROWIN TH O ARD FORSES TAT CUP DOWN  THE OTHER SEPERATED FROM THE OTHER MMONT

9079,A PARALLEL CIRCUIT,PAROLEICUS
9080,UM THE LIGHT BULB ON THE RIGHT IS BURNED OUT,THE IBEL ON THE RAIS BIRN OUT
9081,WELL ONE THING IS THAT THIS IS A PROBABLY A PARALLEL CIRCUIT BECAUSE WHEN I CLICKED ON ONE OF THE LIGHT BULBS THE OTHER ONE DIDN'T BURN OUT,ONE THING ALIRBECAUS E THE OTHERO
9082,TODAY WE MADE ELECTROMAGNETS BUT OURS DIDN'T WORK PROBABLY BECAUSE WE HAD A DEAD BATTERY,TDAY WMA LLETS RS IDNTOBL BECASE WE HAD A ER
9083,IF ONE OF THE LIGHT BULBS BURN OUT OH THEN UM NONE OF THE LIGHT BULBS WILL LIGHT UP,E  NB LIGHT UP
9084,UM IT IS A SERIES CIRCUIT SO THE LIGHT BULBS DIDN'T BURN VERY BRIGHT,M ERO SIRCULITBDD A AE
9085,YES I HAVE,YESIAVE
9086,THEN THE ENERGY CAN'T FLOW THROUGH TO THE TO THE LIGHT BULB SO UM THE LIGHT BULB CANNOT LIGHT UP,THTHE ENMARGY CANT FLOW THR THE LIT BSLTBL CT LIGHT UP
9087,HI MARNIE,IMAY
9088,IT HAS TO BE IN UM IT DOESN'T MATTER WHICH UM IT DOESN'T MATTER WHICH BRAD WHICH WIRE GOES ON WHICH BRAD JUST AS LONG AS IT'S THE CORRECT BRAD,IT HAS HB IN I DOESN'T MATER I DOUSN'T MAER IH BIGS ON CHUST AS ONG CECT
9089,BRADS,BREATH
9090,I NEED,
9091,THINGS,THANKS
9092,WE JUST FINISHED UH LIGHTING UP TWO LIGHT BULBS WITH ONE BATTERY IN CLASS RIGHT N A COUPLE OF MINUTES AGO,WE'VE JUST FINISHED LITINGP TWO LBRBS WITH ONE BATTERPL MNTS
9093,I'M GOOD,I'MGOOD
9094,GOOD BYE,GBY
9095,MARNIE IT'S TIME FOR ME TO GO,HAS TIME FOR METO GO
9096,BECAUSE THEN THEY WILL BURN BRIGHTER,BECAUSE THEL NTH ITER
9097,THE ELECTRICITY DOESN'T HAVE TO PASS THROUGH ANOTHER BULB IT CAN JUST GO STRAIGHT BACK TO THE BATTERY SO IT IS VERY GOOD,THE ILLCTISDY DOESN'T HAVE TO PASS THRO AN NOTHER BMS JUST GO STRAT BTO THE BSIS VERY GOOD
9098,UM THERE ARE TWO,ON THEIR AR TWO
9099,HI MARNIE,IMO
9100,YEAH,YW
9101,THE,
9102,WELL ACTUALLY THEY ONLY HAVE ONE ENERGY SOURCE BECAUSE THAT IS THE D CELL BUT THEY HAVE TWO DIFFERENT WIRES THAT CONNECT TO THE D CELL SO THEY CAN BOTH LIGHT UP THE EXACT SAME AMOUNT,ONLY ON ENERY SORBECAUSE THATIS THE  SELLETH HAV TW DIFRN'T ATEORS CON ECT OHE D SELLEAN BT LIHT TSE AMOUNTS
9103,THEY ARE ABOUT USING ONE D CELL OR BATTERY TO MAKE TWO DIFFERENT LIGHT BULBS LIGHT UP,THAY ARBONE SALL OTER TO MAKE TWO DIFRNT S LIGHT UP
9104,YEAH THAT THAT WHE THAT UH LEFT IS THE WAY THAT UH,ARM T LET I THE A
9105,UM WELL WE KNEW THAT WE'D TRY THE HALFWAY POINT AT TWENTY FIRST AND IF THAT WENT TOO FAR WE'D START GOING LOWER AND THEN WE FIGURED OUT THE HALFWAY POINT WAS SEVENTEEN,WWWE TRY T HAVP TENTY FRSTENT TO FAR SWE SEIRCLING AI SEVEN TEN
9106,UM YOU NEED A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF TWIST WHICH IS FORTY YEAH MMM HMM UM THE STRING YOU HAVE TO HAVE IT ON THE STRING,OU EAE A SIRTN AMOUT O TWIST TWH IS FORTY THE STRIN LED  HAVE  ON THE STRIN
9107,YEAH,
9108,IT'S SOMETIMES CONFUSING CAUSE WE DON'T KNOW WHEN TO CHANGE EM OR WHEN TO KEEP EM THE SAME,SOME TIMES COMPUTING CAUS WEDON'TWIN THE ORW M THE SAME
9109,YEAH,
9110,YEAH,
9111,WHEN YOU ADDED MORE PASSENGERS,WHEN WE  O PASONGERES
9112,MMM HMM YEAH,
9113,YEAH,
9114,YEAH MMM HMM YEAH,
9115,HOW FAR IT WOULD GO WITH TWO PASSENGERS AND THEN FOUR PASSENGERS AND SO ON,HO T WITH TWO PASONDERES IFOUR PASDER
9116,UM MAYBE THE IT'D BE ANOTHER SPEED ONE BUT IT WOULDN'T BE WITH THE FAN IT'D BE WITH MORE PROPELLERS,MA THE AB OTHER SPEAD ONE  BE WITH AA BEE WITH MARS
9117,UH BECAUSE IT'S HALF OF FORTY,BECAUSE ITHORTY
9118,UH WELL BECAUSE IF YOU CHANGE TWO VARIABLES AT THE SAME TIME IT MIGHT NOT GO OUT GO AS WELL AS YOU PREDICTED IT WOULD,BECAUS F YOU CANGED TOO VERRIABLES AT THE SAME TIME T NT GO AS WLLS ICTED
9119,IT MADE IT GO SLOWER BECAUSE OF THE WEIGHT ON THE PLANE,TMA GOW SLOWER BECAUSE TH
9120,YEAH CAUSE,YA
9121,FORTY,ERTY
9122,UH SORT OF WE ARE FIGURING OUT HOW TO FLY AN AIRPLANE ON A STRING,SOTWE OUR FIG HAD A LA AIRPLANE ON THE STREIN
9123,UH YEAH,
9124,MAYBE THE SPEED CAUSE WE I HAVE A FRIEND WHO IS DOING LIKE A F SIX METER ONE,MABE THE SPED CAS WEI HVE A FRIEND  IS JEWING LIK SIX MEATOS ONE
9125,UH WHEN THE PLANE ACTUALLY FLEW ACROSS THE STRING CAUSE I DIDN'T THINK IT'D EVEN GET AN INCH,WHEN T PLAIN EXT W FLU COST THE STRINGIDIDT THINK EVEN
9126,YEAH,
9127,UM BECAUSE THEY KNEW THAT IT WAS GONNA GET A LOT MORE SPEED WITH THE FAN,BECAUSE THEY NEW MEDOS ET ALOT R SPEAD WITH AMCY
9128,MMM HMM YEAH,
9129,WE WANTED TO SEE THE HALFWAY POINT AND ALL THE OTHER POINTS ON THE STRINGS,WE ONE STE CATFAY  OTHER POINTS THE STREET
9130,UH WELL WE TRIED TO WE FIGURED OUT THE HALFWAY POINT AND THE,L WE TRY TO ICR OUP THE AFHLAPA IN THEEE
9131,UH WELL WE PUT IT ON WRONG SO OR I TWISTED IT WRONG AND SO WHEN I TWISTED IT ONE WAY IT STARTED GOING BACKWARDS,WE PUTIT ON ROG TSTED SER TSTEDOA  SARCHGOING BACKWARD
9132,YEAH MMM HMM,
9133,UH THEY ARE LIKE THE STANDARD THING THAT MAKES IT FLY OR IN WHAT YOU NEED TO MAKE IT FLY,THEY LIKE THE STANARD THING THATMAKE A FLY OAD TF
9134,YEAH,
9135,TE,TWO
9136,MMM THAT WE C UM,A
9137,THAT IT GOES BACKWARDS WHEN YOU TWIST IT AND RIGHT IS THE WAY IT GOES FORWARD YEAH YEAH,THE GOWS BACK WAOUD ON YOU TWASTE N RI S THE RAT GOS FORWARD
9138,UH WELL BECAUSE WE COULDN'T REALLY CHANGE THAT S YET AND SO WE JUST KEPT IT YOU AT THE TIME YOU COULD ONLY CHANGE ONE VARIABLE AND SO,BECAUSE WE CAN REALLY CHANGE THYET IN S  TIME YOU CAN ONLY CHANGE ONE VERRIABLE
9139,AND THEN OUR STANDARD WAS WE DIDN'T REALLY HAVE ANY PASSENGERS SO WHEN WE PUT MORE PASSENGERS ON WE CHANGED THE VARIABLES A LOT,AR STAARDS S W DIDN'T REALLY HAVES NY PASONDERWHEN WE PUT  PASONDERES WE CHANGED THE VERIABLE
9140,WE CHANGED LIKE ONE PART OF THE WHOLE STANDARD THING,WE CHANGED LIKE ONTH STADRD
9141,YEAH,
9142,IT REALLY JUST AFFECTED IT A LOT BECAUSE USUALLY WITHOUT E WITH THE SAME AMOUNT OF WEIGHT THAT IT HAD BEFORE IT KEPT IT ON THE SAME THING,REALLY JUST ECTEDOG BECOAS LY WITH WITH THE SAME S FOR PT ON THE SAME IMS
9143,HI,FV
9144,ER NO IT MADE IT NOT AS GO NOT AS FAR,ENOT A  OS FOR
9145,UH WELL WE JUST USED THE STANDARD PROPELLER SPEED,WILL WE JUST S THE STANDAT O
9146,WE JUST HA WE HAD TO CHANGE THE AMOUNT OF SPINS FOR THE PROPELLER YEAH OR ELSE IT WOULDN'T GET ACROSS AT ALL,WEV HAD TA CAME SLEME OSPOONS FOTHE PRERRO
9147,WE HAVE TO USE THEM A LOT CAUSE WE CHANGE EM AND KEEP EM THE SAME AND CHANGE EM AND,WE AS THEM AIV M TH  M
9148,YEAH MMM HMM,BYO
9149,UM WE SPUN IT EIGHTY TIMES AND IT GOT ALL THE WAY ACROSS YEAH,WE 'VSPUEIGHT TIMES V CROSS
9150,UM WELL IT IF IT WELL THERE YOU TWIST OKAY THERE'S A COUPLE WAYS THAT YOU CAN TWIST IT IF YOU TWIST IT ONE WAY IT'LL GO BACKWARDS AND ANOTHER WAY IT'LL GO FORWARDS,THE THAS A CRPLE AS T YOU CAN TWASTED OU TWASTE ONE WAY  GO BACKWARD IN A OTHER WAY  GO FORWARD
9151,IT'S PROBABLY GONNA MAKE IT SLOW DOWN A LOT,IT POBLE CAMAK IT SLO  DOWN THE A
9152,UH I LOVE TO WRITE AND DO MATH,I L RIT  A
9153,UM YEAH,REA
9154,IF YOU LIKE CHANGED HOW MANY PROPELLERS OR SOMETHING THAT WAS ON THERE IT MIGHT GO FARTHER OR FASTER,O LIKES CHANGE MNE ATHORS FOR SOMI IT MIT GO FATHEASTER
9155,UM WELL THOSE TOOTHPICKS IT HELPS HOLD THE PROPELLER IN SO IT'D STAY ON AND WON'T FALL OFF MMM HMM,WIL THOS TWOIS ELPS L THE RPTER IN SOW
9156,HMM I WOULD HAVE TO SAY READING,I WLD HAVE TO SAVE READING
9157,YEAH WE HAVEN'T CHA WE'RE GONNA LIKE PUT LITTLE PAPER CLIPS ON IT,WE HAVEA ORGON  TL PAPER CLIFS
9158,UM WE'VE BEEN DOING A LOT OF THINGS LIKE WE'RE RIGHT NOW WE'RE LEARNING HOW LIKE ABOUT AIRPLANES AND PROPELLERS AND THAT SORT OF THING,WE'VE BIN DUWING A LOT THINGS IK TLIKE ABOUT AIRPLAINS I EORS THAT SOURTING
9159,YEAH,
9160,MMM HMM YEAH,
9161,MMM HMM YEAH,YELLW
9162,UM WE START AT ONE SIDE OF THE CHAIR AND WE START SPINNING THE PROPELLER AND THEN WE HOLD IT AND WE WAIT AND THEN WE LET IT GO AND IT JUST GOES STRAIGHT ACROSS,WE STARTED ONE SIDE THE CHARWE STARCHE FITING THE PRPESER W LGO TREET ACROSS
9163,PROBABLY MAKING IT FLY CAUSE IT TOOK US A REALLY LONG TIME TO MAKE IT GO THE CERTAIN AMOUNT,BCSIT TOOK AS A RELI ONG TIME T MARAT
9164,YEAH,
9165,I DON'T REALLY UNDERSTAND HOW IT'D FLY I JUST DOES IT LIKE SUCK IN THE A I JUST DON'T KNOW IF IT SUCKS IN THE AIR TO MAKE IT OR PUSHES OUT AIR TO MAKE IT GO,N'T REALLY UNDER STAN HDOST LIKE SIN THJICUS IN THE ARMA ORPUSHES O
9166,UM MAKE IT GO FASTER OR MAYBE FARTHER,GROW FASTER OR MA BE FARTHER
9167,YEAH MMM HMM,Y
9168,UM UH WELL UH,MS OI
9169,UH IT WAS BETWEEN LIKE THIRTY FIVE AND FORTY ABOUT,IT WAS BETWEEN  THRTY FIVE AND FOURTY OUT
9170,LIKE Y YOU'D LIKE TWIST THE PROPELLER SO IT GETS THE PUSH OF IT HELPS THE PLANE GLIDE OR GET PUSHED ACROSS,YU LIKE TWEAST THE RPELER SO  THE PUSH HELP T PLAIN  PUSH A CROSS
9171,UM IF YOU GO LEFT IT WOULD GO BACKWARDS AND RIGHT IT'D GO FORWARD,FEBR ET T GO BACKWARD N  FOWARD
9172,UH IT'D BE SORTA LIKE THE PASSENGERS ON THE PLANE,BEM SORTLIE PASONDERES OTHLAN
9173,YEAH,
9174,I DIDN'T KNOW THAT THE PLANE WOULD FLY THAT EASILY JUST STRAIGHT ACROSS,THE PLAIN WUD FLY THE EASRLY JUST STRT ACROSS
9175,YEAH,
9176,OKAY,
9177,UH I'M THE I HAVE BEEN THE BEST READER IN MY GRADES FOR THE PAST SEVEN YEARS YEAH,UM I VE BIN THE BEST REATDER IN MY GRAVES FOR THE PAST SEVEN YEAR ER
9178,BECAUSE THE PAPER CLIPS MAKE IT A LOT HEAVIER AND USUALLY IT'S JUST LIGHTS AND IT IT'LL JUST FLY ACROSS BUT WITH THE PAPER CLIPS,BECAUSE THE PAPER LIFS MAKES  ALEV ER DYSLYE JUST HITS  L JUST  CROSS WH
9179,THEY'RE LIKE ABOUT THAT BIG AND YOU HOOK EM ONTO THE PLANE AND WE'RE GONNA SEE HOW MANY CAN GET ACROSS WITHOUT MAKING IT STOP,BU TT P THE PLAYOU CAN SE HO MONY GET AROSS HS
9180,YEAH,YELW
9181,YEAH,
9182,UM WELL THE STRAWS JUST HELP IT KEEP IT ON THE STRINGS SO THAT IT CAN FLY,THE A JUST HEP KB ON THE STRING SO THEAT IT CAN FLY
9183,YEAH AND THE PROPELLER IS REALLY THE MAIN THING CAUSE IT REALLY GETS THE PUSH IT JUST MAKE IT GO RIGHT ACROSS,THE RPEASLER IS REALLY THE V THING S REALY GTS THE PUSH UST M HT ACROSS
9184,YEAH,
9185,YEAH IT W,
9186,YEAH,
9187,OH THE DIFFERENT CENTIMETERS ON THE STICK,THE DIFRNT SIVE MATORES ON THE STIKE
9188,UH YEAH,
9189,YEAH,
9190,YEAH,
9191,UH PUT IT PUT LIGHTER WEIGHTS ON IT,PUT  HLITER WHIT ON A
9192,MMM HMM YEAH,
9193,YEAH IF,AER
9194,WE UM WE CHANGED THE VARIABLES BY MAKING THE MASS OF THE TIN FOIL SQUARES BIGGER LIKE WE'LL GO TO THIRTY CENTIMETER TIN FOIL SHEETS AND THEN SO ON,WE CHANGED THE VEIABLES  MAKING A MAST O THE TENSCWAR BAGR LIK  GO THIRTY SEVN
9195,IT WOULD GO A LOT FARTHER CAUSE IT HAS LESS WEIGHT AND,IT W GO OFARTHERCAUS  DAS LES
9196,UH ALL THE WAY IN YEAH IS YEAH,ALBERATON
9197,YEAH YEAH,E
9198,IT WOULDN'T YOU COULDN'T REALLY COMPARE ANYTHING CAUSE YOUR ANSWERS TO IT WOULD BE ALL DIFFERENT AND YEAH,YOU CAN RELLY COMPAR NE THINAS OUR ANTER TOAT WILL BE IFRIENT
9199,IT REALLY DEPENDED ON THE PLACE WHERE YOU HAD PUT IT CAUSE REALLY IF YOU DIDN'T HAVE IT IT WOULDN'T GO ANYWHERE,REALLY DEPENTET ON TH PLASE WEAR YOU A PUTCAS REALLY FOUDIDN'T HAVE ITI GO NE WAR
9200,YEAH,
9201,CAUSE UH THEN IT TELLS YOU UH MORE ABOUT IT AND WHAT YOU'RE GONNA REALLY DO IN THE SCIENCE PROJECT,BCAUSTHEN ITELES YO OBOUT IT ND WOURG REALLY D IH SF OECT
9202,YEAH,YLW
9203,BALL UH I FORGOT WHAT IT'S CALLED YEAH OR EXCEPT WE MADE OURS SQUARE CAUSE IT'LL STAY ON THE STICK BETTER,I FI LD EPT WE MAD AR SCWA ZU AIN THE STAKYATER
9204,MMM YEAH,
9205,IT THE OBJECT THAT YOU'RE FLINGING,H OBJECTED YOUR
9206,YEAH,
9207,BE DIFFERENT,IFRN
9208,YEAH,YW
9209,YEAH,
9210,YEAH,
9211,BUT THE LOWER THE UM FARTHER OUT YOU PUT THE STICK THE MORE UM THE LESS UM,B TH LOTHE ALMFOR THER EYOU PUT THE STICK INTHE AMTHE LET
9212,UM TEN CENTIMETER AND TWENTY CENTIMETER ALUMINUM FOIL,TEN SEVENMEATR I TWENTY LLUM
9213,SO FAR WE HAVE UM SEEN H WHAT THE HIGHEST UM FLING WAS AND WITH WHAT OBJECT IT WAS,SO FAR WE AVE   THE HIYISTLNG A  WITH WT OBJECTED S
9214,YEAH,
9215,ALUMINUM FOIL,LUMERR
9216,IT WOULD BE WAY OFF BECAUSE THEY WOULD GO LIKE ACROSS THE ROOM AND OTHER PEOPLE WOULD ONLY GO MAYBE LIKE A QUARTER OF THE WAY ACROSS THE ROOM,IT L BE WAY OFF BECAUS THEAY WIL GO CROSS THE RNOTHER PEOPLS
9217,IT'S GONNA GO NOT AS FAR,SCAGO NOTS FAR
9218,IT WOULD PROBABLY GET M ALL MESSED UP AND WOULDN'T WORK JUST LIKE IT WAS SUPPOSED TO AND JUST T JUST STOP WORKING AFTER THEY TRIED IT,IT WLD PROBLY ET ALLSTUAND DN'T R JUSIKE WITH SPTUT SAPINGTER THE
9219,UH MAYBE ANGLE ON IT AND SEE IF WE CAN CHA UH,MA BE ANGRY AND SE F YOU CH
9220,IT IT'S LIKE A SYSTEM ALL THE PARTS WORK TOGETHER IN TO MAKE SOMETHING ELSE WORK TOGETHER,EALIKES  IT A WR TGEATHER IN TO MAKE SOME THING ELSE
9221,UH WE HAD UH WHAT IS IT CALLED IT'S LIKE A LITTLE,WE   OSIKE ALOER
9222,UH IT'LL PROBABLY MAKE IT GO FARTHER BECAUSE IT HAS A LOT MORE ANGLE N AND IT'S MORE UPRIGHT MORE THAN IF YOU HAVE IT FLAT IT'LL JUST GO UP,IL PROBLOME  GOS FARTHER BECAUS  A SMOR TH YOU HAVE A FLAT
9223,YEAH,
9224,HEIGHT OR LENGTH AWAY IT WOULD GET,I R LENGTH

9292,THIS IS THE D CELL BATTERY,THE DM
9293,WELL WHEN YOU DON'T HOOK IT UP RIGHT WITH THE WIRES AND THE BATTERY AND THE LIGHT BULBS,WEN YOU GO R UPRIT WITH THE WAIRETHE EBL
9294,YES,NIX
9295,YEAH,UOR
9296,WELL THE ENERGY COMES FROM THIS SIDE INTO THE LIGHT BULB,WILL THE IMAGERY CUMS FROM THE SIDE IN TO THE LIPE BOLB
9297,WELL WE WERE SUPPOSED TO USE ONE BUT OUR GROUP THOUGHT MAYBE TWO BATTERIES FOR TWO LIGHT BULBS BUT THAT DIDN'T REALLY WORK SO WE TOOK ONE D CELL,WE  POO ON ARTHB TWO BAERS FOR TO BUS   RELLY R TY G
9298,YEAH,W
9299,YES SOMETIMES,SUM TIME A
9300,YEAH,
9301,PROBABLY RIGHT HERE,A
9302,YEAH KIND OF WE WERE LIKE UH MAYBE THIS ISN'T THE RIGHT WAY TO DO IT,I OF WEBRL MAB THE S
9303,AND THEN THIS CONNECTS TO THE SWITCH,I CONETD T THE
9304,YEAH,
9305,THE SWITCH IS WORKING IT'S A CLOSED CIRCUIT WHEN THE SWITCH IS WORKING AND WHEN IT'S OPEN IT'S AN OPEN CIRCUIT AND OPEN CIRCUITS DON'T WORK SO WHEN YOU LIFT IT UP IT WON'T WORK CAUSE IT'S AN OPEN CIRCUIT,THE SEANG A LOSE SRWEN THE IS ANOPEN IOPEN IRCOPEN SIRLFTD CAUS  N PEN CIRCUS
9306,AND THIS HOOKS UP TO THE LIGHT BULB CHAMBER,TH LABRE E
9307,IT'S HERE AND THAT,R
9308,THAT'S A SWITCH AND THEN THESE ARE WHERE YOU CONNECT THE WIRES,Y EVE ARE AY CONICTD THE WAITRES
9309,I THINK SO MAYBE,THING SOO MA BEY
9310,WELL,W
9311,OKAY,
9312,WELL,OW
9313,AND WE PROBABLY TOUCHED THE SWITCH TO,SOYATACH  SWI
9314,WELL,GROW
9315,MOST OF THEM YEAH,MOST
9316,HERE INTO THE OTHER,THE OTHER
9317,OKAY,
9318,THAT HAVING TWO BATTERIES WOULD BE KIND OF HARDER SINCE YOU HAVE TWO LIGHT BULBS IT WOULD SEEM TO BE EASIER BUT BECAUSE WE HAVE TWO MORE ONE MORE TO H BATTERY TO HANDLE IT'S A LITTLE BIT HARDER,HAVING TOOATERS E IN A ASINU  TSSM TBE EASIERBECAUSE WE HAVE ON BTER NDADR
9319,UM IT'S NOT CONNECTED SO THERE'S NO USUALLY A CIRCUIT WOULD GO LIKE THIS IT'S FULL,I NOT CONLECTED S THEAZLY  CIRCUS O GO K THI FOUR
9320,AND IT GOES THROUGH,AIGOS THROU
9321,ENERGY AND THEN IT GOES OUT,IMAGRYAGOS OUT
9322,THIS IS THE POSITIVE SIDE AND THIS IS THE NEGATIVE SIDE,TH INSIDE D
9323,YEAH MY TEACHER DID IT'S PARALLEL CIRCUITS WELL WE NOTICED THAT THE LIGHT BULB WHEN IT LIT UP IT WAS DULL SO PARALLEL CIRCUITS I THINK MAKE THEM LIGHT UP MORE,PAYB IRCW WE NOTSE THEHE L WHENPARB CIRCUS I TILT
9324,WHEN YOU CONNECT IT TO THE LIGHT BULB I IT HAS TO CONNECT TO METAL TO METAL OR IT WON'T WORK,WHEN YOU CONRECT T TO THE LBIT HAS O CONECT MAERE TOMAOW
9325,THAT PARALLEL CAN NEVER TOUCH,THAT ALO CAL NEVER TACH
9326,THE SWITCH MAKES THEM TURN ON AND OFF SO MAYBE IF YOU GO UP OR DOWN YOU COULD ALWAYS COME BACK TO OFF OR ON OR,THE SWEAT MAKES THEM TIRN ON ASMB   OR YOU CAN ALWAYS CUM BACK TO OFFER ONER
9327,NAH UH,
9328,SO THE LIGHT BULB CAN GET ALL OF IT'S,SI THEIBO C ET ELEPHANTS
9329,BECAUSE IT WAS KIND OF TOO COMPLICATED TO DO IT WITH TWO CAUSE YOU HAD TO FIGURE OUT A SPECIAL WAY WHEN WITH ONE BATTERY YOU COULD DO A WHOLE BUNCH OF WAYS,BS OMPTTED WITHOECAUSE YO HAS SWWTONEICE
9330,THE PA NEGATIVE SIDE OF THE BATTERY AND THEN THIS WOULD HAVE THE POSITIVE SIDE,NADSITHE BUTTER I TE  WD HAVE A POST INSIDE
9331,YEAH,
9332,MMM HMM YAY,SA
9333,YEAH,W
9334,YEAH,
9335,SHE COULD PUT ANOTHER BULB IN,SHE CTHRA
9336,THE LIGHT BULB DOES NOT LIGHT UP,TB DES NOT IT UP
9337,YEAH,YE
9338,ONLY ONE UH A BROTHER HE'S IN COLLEGE NOW THOUGH,ONLY NEUBRETHER HES I CURS NAOW
9339,A PARALLEL CIRCUIT IS WHEN THEY NEVER TOUCH SO IF ONE BULB GOES OUT IT'LL JUST BE OUT AND ALL THE OTHERS WILL JUST KEEP GOING BECAUSE WELL IT'S ITS OWN LITTLE CIRCUIT KIND OF,A PA BCIRUSS WEN THE EVER ONE BLOP GOS OUT TBTHE OTHERS WUP ONLL CIRCUS
9340,AN OPEN CIRCUIT IS WHEN UM IS WHEN MAYBE IF YOU HAVE A SWITCH IN A SERIES CIRCUIT AND YOU LIFT IT UP IT BECOMES AN OPEN CIRCUIT AND NOTHING HAPPENS,IN OPEN CIRCUSSWE BYOU HAVE A SWA TERI IRCUSBECAUMES A OPEN CIRCUNTHINGHAPEN
9341,WELL IT IT STOPS THE WHOLE LIGHT FROM BEING LIGHTED CAUSE IT MAKES AN OPEN CIRCUIT,TSTTH HL LI FROM VLATERBECAUS IT MAKS A OPEN CIRCUS
9342,PARALLEL,E
9343,I THINK IT WOULD GO OUT,I WI GO OUT
9344,MMM HMM YEAH,
9345,YES YEAH,RA
9346,ACTUALLY THAT ONE WOULD PROBABLY WELL,THAT WONE WI PROBBL
9347,OKAY,
9348,UM WELL IT'S JUST LIKE ANY OTHER LIGHT BULB UH THE FILAMENT WOULD BREAK,IM JUST LIKE E OTHER ELMENT
9349,HELLO NO YEAH,NOW
9350,SO IT WOULD COME OUT HERE AND THEN GO THROUGH HERE AND THEN COME HERE AND THEN COME THROUGH HERE EXCEPT THERE PROBABLY WOULDN'T BE ENOUGH LEFT AFTER IT WENT THROUGH OVER HERE,UM OUT GO TR UMMTHIR POBBLY W BE NNFETATER
9351,UM THEY ALL STOPPED,THAY  STP
9352,THOSE LIGHTS ARE BRIGHT E THEY'RE BRIGHTER THAN THE SERIES AND I THINK IT'S BECAUSE THEY DON'T TAKE EACH OTHER'S ELECTRICITY,TINKBECAUS THE DON'T A EHTHERLTISY
9353,YEP,
9354,SURE,
9355,THE BULB WOULD JUST STAY LIGHT,THT
9356,THE NO,
9357,IT HAD WAY TOO MUCH ELECTRICITY AND THEN AND THEN WHEN YOU REACHED THREE IT'LL JUST BLOW UP THE LIGHT BULB,ASED TOO MUCH ANLETTISYW WYE RACE THREE
9358,AND IT NEVER IT NEVER REALLY ACTUALLY ATTACHES WIRES TO THE OTHER LIGHT BULB,NEVER REALLY ACTOLEAE ACHE AS WIR
9359,WELL IT WOULD CREATE THE ELECTRICITY TO GO STRAIGHT THROUGH,WIL AT THE LECTISIY TO GO STRET THRO
9360,WELL THE LIGHTS AT FIRST THEY WOULD GO ON THEN WHEN A FILAMENT WOULD BREAK IT WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO ALL OPEN,LIKE FST THAY IGO O THE EOT I E W NTBE ABEL T OPEN
9361,AND THEN THIS ONE WOULD TAKE SOME OF THE ELECTRICITY AND THEN GO LIKE THIS,THI ONE WILD TAKE SOME LECTIYIS
9362,YEAH OUR TEACHER TOLD US TO DO THAT BUT WE DIDN'T REALLY GET THE WHOLE THING I YEAH HOW DO WE WER THE PEOPLE THAT WERE MAKING A PARALLEL DIDN'T KNOW EXACTLY HOW TO DO THAT,AUR TCH TOOUT D TWDIDNT RELLY  THE  TINGSPEOPLE LIKE ART MAKING APARL INT ZY
9363,AFTERNOON,OFFT
9364,UM WELL OF COURSE THE LIGHT BULB IS PROBABLY LIGHTING UP MOST LIKELY OF COURSE AND WELL,OF COURS LAGE BAL IS POBOBLY  MOST YOF OUR
9365,YEAH I THINK IT WOULD BE LIKE MAYBE ONE CIRCUIT AND THEN THE OTHER CIRCUIT BUT,I THINK IT WILL BE LIKE MAE ONE CIRCUS IN THE OTHER CIRCUS
9366,YEAH,
9367,YEAH,R
9368,AND THEN GO BACK INTO THE LIGHT BULB TO MAKE IT GO OUT,GO BACK IN TO THE LPL TMGO OT
9369,CAUSE THEY NEVER TOUCH,ECAS TH NEVER TCH
9370,ELECTRICITY,ILECTISOY
9371,BECAUSE IT'S AN OPEN CIRCUIT AND UM IT'S NOT ATTACHING T WELL IT'S NOT METAL TO METAL IN,BECAUSE ITAN OPEN CIRCUS  SLTS OT M TTE
9372,UM NO THAT'S A SERIES,R
9373,CIRCUIT YEP,CIRCUST
9374,YEAH THAT ONE LOOKS RIGHT,A DICWATE
9375,YES MMM HMM,YES
9376,OKAY,
9377,I,HA  TO BIG
9378,YEAH,A
9379,UM THERE'S JUST NOT ENOUGH ELECTRICITY TO CREATE UH ENOUGH FOR TWO,THERIS JUST NLETISY TO CRAT E E
9380,WELL WHEN YOU HAVE A LIGHT BULB LIKE THIS ONE I GUESS IT WOULD BE LI UM THE LIGHT BULB WOULD,S WHEN YOU HAVE A B TIS MONIWILL BE THE LE B D
9381,THAT'S IS S S THE BATTERY D CELL,THAT IS THE BUTER D
9382,WELL OKAY SO THIS WOULD BE THE PA THIS WOULD BE THE POSITIVE SIDE AND THEN SO IT WOULD GO THROUGH AND THEN INTO THE LIGHT BULB AND THEN OUT BACK,WL BE PASTEN IT WIL GO THRO EN ENTER THE LAB   A
9383,YEAH,
9384,IT'S ALL STOPPING AND STAYING,ISTARTI I TH STE
9385,YEAH WELL IT WOULD PROBABLY BE BRIGHTER OR THE SAME BECAUSE IT'S IT'S OWN LITTLE CIRCUIT SO IT WOULDN'T REALLY,WILL POBBL BE RIER OR THE SAME BECAUSE THI  D CIRCUSELYF
9386,THAT'D PROBABLY BE A PARALLEL MINE ARE THAT WAY TOO,AT UBLSBE A PAOI  TAT
9387,YEAH UM ALMOST TEN,ASTIME
9388,THESE AREN'T WORKING,WAING
9389,BECAUSE WHEN YOU PRESS IT DOWN METAL TO METAL IT JUST GOES STRAIGHT THROUGH ALL THE WAY TO THE LIGHT BULB,CWEN YOU PAS  DOWN MEO TOMOUST GO STREET THR ELEVA T BS
9390,I DON'T KNOW,
9391,WELL WE WANT TO MAKE A PARALLEL CIRCUIT,WE WORMT TO MAKE A PASLELE CIRCUS
9392,YEAH,
9393,EXCEPT WHEN WE TRIED UM PUTTING TWO D CELLS TOGETHER UM POSITIVE SIDE TO POSITIVE OR NEGATIVE SIDE JUST PUTTING THEM TOGETHER,EPT WHEN WE TRY PUTING THE ELLO TMPASTE SID ASE SDUST PUING THEM TO GEATHER
9394,THAT WOULD PROBABLY I DON'T KNOW WELL,TAPROBBLY ANO
9395,YEAH,
9396,YEAH,
9397,NO BUT WE THOUGHT ABOUT IT AND THEN WE DECIDED TO AND THEY PROBABLY ARE DOING IT RIGHT NOW,WE THOUGHT ABOUT IT WE DESID T IEARD
9398,COMPLETE THE FLOW,COMPLEATFLOW
9399,WELL,W
9400,YEAH,
9401,YEAH,AYOUTS
9402,YES,
9403,HELLO,
9404,OKAY,
9405,WELL,
9406,YEAH,
9407,UM YEAH THAT LOOKS ABOUT RIGHT,W HAVEE IG ABOT RI
9408,THE BATTERY UM CREATES THE ELECTRICITY TO THE FLOW,TH ATERCREAT HE ELLECTISOTY OH FOU
9409,YEAH,
9410,YEAH,
9411,HE GOES TO FRONT RANGE IN FORT COLLINS,HE WAS T FRIIN FOR ALOT
9412,I WOULD TELL HERE THAT THE LIGHTS DID NOT BURN OUT IT'S JUST ONE OF THEM BURNED OUT AND CREATED AN OPEN CIRCUIT TO MAKE IT AS THE ELECTRICITY WOULDN'T FLOW THROUGH,LTELL HER TTHE LIGT NOT BIR JUST ONE THUMBRATD AN OPEN CIRCSLTDFLW THREW
9413,UM YOU WOULD HAVE A BATTERY,U A A BER
9414,UM IT GOT BRIGHTER I THINK IT EVEN GO BRIGHTER THAN THE PARALLEL CIRCUIT,EI TNK TEVEN CRITER FROM THE PALICUL
9415,APRIL TWENTY FOURTH,TWNT
9416,YEAH,
9417,BUT I THINK I HAVE AN IDEA MMM WELL THAT'S LIKE A SERIES BUT,THINHAT LIKE A THERIOUS
9418,MMM YEAH,
9419,WELL WHEN YOU HAVE,WEN OUHA
9420,YEAH HE COMES TO TOWN EVERY WEEKEND,HE UMS TOWNEVERY
9421,YES IN THE SERIES CIRCUIT THAT I MADE WE HAD VERY DULL LIGHT BULBS SO,IN THE TERIOUS CIRCUS  MAD WE HAD VERY LIFE BOAT
9422,NORMALLY ON A SERIES I THINK I DON'T KNOW EITHER,NORVALEI NK
9423,MMM HMM UM THE LIGHT BULB DOESN'T LIGHT UP,AIBL DOESNT LI TUP
9424,YEAH,
9425,UM THE MORE WRAPS YOU YOU DO AROUND THE RIVET MAKES IT SO THAT IT'S STRONGER AND MAYBE IT KEEPS LIKE A LOT OF ENERGY GOING THROUGH IT THE MORE WRAPS,HAOU L ROWN THE MAKS I SO IT STRONGER TN THE B OP LAKE A OT OF INARGY GOIN THR
9426,I DID UM MY PREDICTION WAS THAT TEN WOULD PICK UP HALF OF ITS NUMBER AND THAT DID NOT HAPPEN,MY PRDECTION  THE TEN WILPAK  HAF UMBEROSNOTAPEN
9427,YEAH WE DID,
9428,WELL WHATEVER,B
9429,UM UM IT LOOKED WELL HERE'S THE ZERO ZERO MY AXIS UM,AI LIC WLM  HEARS THE ZERO ZERO AMND
9430,AND SOMETIMES UH THERE WAS BOTH SIDES THERE WAS A WIRE AND THEN ON THE END IT WAS SPLIT INTO TWO SO IT WOULD BE LIKE ONE BATTERY OVER HERE AND ONE BATTERY OVER HERE,SUMTIME THER IS SIDES THE A WATHE D W PTTO TWO SBE LIKE ONEAT
9431,YES,A
9432,UM NO LINES ARE THE DOTS ARE WHERE THE LINE WHERE IT GOES AND SO THEN THAT PICKED UP THREE SO IT'D BE,NINES A THE DOGS AR WE THE  WEGOWS AND SELATH PICKTS UP THREE SN B
9433,AND THEN WE PICKED UP TWENTY,PICT UP TWENTY
9434,UM I DON'T OH WHAT'S UM,I SN
9435,HE'S TALKING ABOUT THE FOOD TOMORROW FOR INTERNATIONAL DAY,WIL'LE TAINGABOUT THE FED TOMORROWFANTAAL AY
9436,HERE YEAH AND THEN THIRTY PICKED UP SEVEN IT SHOULD BE FOUR FIVE AND SIX ABOUT HERE,EN OND THRTY PIS P SEVEN HOLBE FOUR FIVVE SIX EMO
9437,UM YEAH WE'RE GOING TO MAKE A TELEGRAPH,ORGANMTA
9438,I DON'T KNOW WHY HE KEEPS TALKING,DON'T NOWCOPS HAKING
9439,UM NO WAIT YES I THOUGHT THAT THE MORE WRAPS YOU HAD THE MORE WASHERS YOU WOULD PICK UP,I THOUGHT THO US WE HAD THLTWPICKUPS
9440,OH WELL I DON'T THINK I THINK I DID THAT WRONG I THINK IT GOES LIKE THIS AND THEN THIS ONE,DT THINK I THIN AAMI THINK AGOS L
9441,HERE,HUOR
9442,YES,TANS
9443,UM THE ENERGY WENT STRAIGHT TO E FROM THE WIRE TO THE UM THE RIVET,THE ANARGY WENT STREET TO FROM THE BAR TO THUMH I
9444,YEAH,
9445,UM YOU CAN'T TURN A MAGNET OFF BUT YOU CAN TURN ELECTROMAGNET OFF,YOU CANT TUIRN THE MA OFFSWE CAN TIRN TLT OS
9446,WELL SINCE WE DID TEN WRAPS AND IT ONLY PICKED UP TWO IT'D BE LIKE,SNT   TEN RAMS ONLY PICT UP ATE
9447,UM YES BECAUSE IT WAS WRAPPED AROUND IN A IN A WIRE AND IT WAS KINDA LIKE A S A LONG STICK,YEBECAUSE HE WAS RAPT  WIRONGSTIK
9448,UM THAT A MAGNET IS ACTUALLY MADE TO PICK THEM UP AND THEN WHEN YOU HAVE AN ELECTROMAGNET YOU HAVE TO DO STUFF TO IT TO MAKE IT PICK STUFF UP,THE  I ALY AD TWHEN YOU HAVE A STOF
9449,UM I THINK WE'RE GONNA USE LIKE EVERYTHING THAT WE'VE DONE ALREADY AND TO MAKE IT BECAUSE UM IT CAUSE ALL THE TIME IT JUST LEADS UP TO SOMETHING BIGGER,I THINK W CANT LK EVERY THING TTWE'VE DUN ALREADY BECAS BECAUS AL THE TIME JUST EAE P SOMTHING BIGER
9450,YEAH,A
9451,HE MADE UM A ROBOT THAT UM DOES MAGIC TRICKS,HE MAD A ROBOT TDOESHM
9452,AND IT WOULD PROBABLY BE NOT EVEN,WIL OBLB NOT EVEN
9453,UM I THINK IT SEEMED WEAKER UM WHEN WE USED ONE BATTERY BUT WHEN WE USED TWO IT MADE IT BIGGER,I TIN TH SAME WEAR WE E  ONE BOERT WHEN  TWO I
9454,YEAH THAT SURPRISED ME FROM THE GAP BETWEEN TEN AND FORTY FIVE YEAH AND WE DID IT THIRTY TIMES AND THAT ONLY GOT US SEVEN SO THAT MAKES REALLY WEIRD SENSE,FROM THE GAT BETWEEN TEN  FOURTY FIVEWE DIDN'T THRTY TIMES NOT ONLY SEVEN SO THAT RALY SIX
9455,NO WE DIDN'T HAVE A SWITCH,DIDN'T HOSE
9456,OF WASHERS,ATS
9457,A LINE POINT GRAPH A LINE POINT GRAPH,ANPANT
9458,UM BECAUSE I THOUGHT IT WOULD PICK UP AT LEAST HALF OF IT'S NUMBER LIKE FIVE EXCEPT IT JUST PICKED UP TWO SO IT'S,BECAUSE I THOUGHT HE WULD PIK  AR LT HAF INOMBER FIVE EPTTPICP TWS
9459,THE ONLY THING THAT I CAN THINK OF IS LIKE UM UH UH UH AT UH A JUNKYARD WHERE UM THEY PICK UP LIKE THE CARS AND THE METAL THINGS WITH THE BIG MAGNET,JASON LE TON THINK LIKE  AD B THELKE THE CARIS IN THE MADO THINGS WITH H BIG ATE
9460,UM WE HAD IT HOOKED UP TO A BATTERY,WEVE HAD KET UP TB
9461,UM I DON'T KNOW BECAUSE WE WE ONLY PRACTICE WITH WASHERS BUT A MAGNET DID PICK THOSE UP SO,ON'T NO BECAUS  ONLY PATUST WITH WATI
9462,AND THEN TEN TWENTY THIRTY FORTY IT ACTUALLY DID GO UP TO FIFTY SO,NEN EN TWE THERT  ACHLE DI GO UP TO FIFTY ZERO
9463,UM WRAPS,BRAT
9464,MMM HMM YEAH,DEPTHS
9465,UM WE HAD A WIRE CONNECTED TO THE BATTERY THAT WAS WRAPPED AROUND THE RIVET UM AND THEN THE OTHER SIDE WENT BACK ONTO THE OTHER SIDE OF THE WIRE WENT BACK ONTO THE WIRE BATTERY,WE HAD A WAR CONDECTED TO THE BUTTERIRAP ON THE THE OTHER SIDE WENT BTHE OTHER SIDE OF HE B
9466,UM WE STARTED MAKING LIGHT BULBS LIGHT WITH A BATTERY THEN WE WENT INTO MOTORS AND THEN WE MADE CIRCUITS AND THEN WE JUST STARTED,WE'E STARTED MAING IPLS LIT WITH A BUTERT  TWE MA SIRC WE'VE JUST STARTED
9467,AND OF COURSE THIS WRAP INCREASED KIND OF MORE THAN WHAT WE DID BECAUSE IT WAS TEN AND TEN AND TEN AND THEN THIS ONE DID FIFTEEN,N OFOURS THI RAPT N IMR ED BECAS WS TENTENENFIFTEN
9468,UM IT'S WHEN YOU HAVE A WIRE AND AN IRON LIKE STICK SORT OF THING,EAT WEN YOU HAVE A WITERE AND AN IRN M STICKS SOR TO THINK
9469,WE READ ABOUT HE STOPPED UM,RHE SP
9470,NEXT WEDNESDAY,NXTWENAY
9471,THE GRAPH YEAH IT WAS KINDA BUILT IN LIKE THIS AND THEN IT HAD TEN TWENTY THIRTY FORTY AND,JAES TEBIL TEN LIKE A S HADS TEN TWY THRTY FOURTY N
9472,UM HE USED HIS WATCH MAKING SKILLS AND HIS MAGICIAN SKILLS,HE YUSED HIS WATCH MAKING SL IMAICION SLES
9473,STRONGER,SRONGER
9474,YEAH WE TRIED IT WITH TEN WRAPS AND THAT US TWO WASHERS,WE TYED  WITH TENRAPS  UGT  TWO WASHE
9475,UM NOT EXACTLY BUT WHEN WE HOOKED THE THE LAST WIRE UP TO THE BATTERY IT WOULD WORK,NOT WE OOKD THE LAST IETHE TERR
9476,YEAH BUT IT DEPENDS ON THE M MAGNET SIZE OF COURSE AND THE RIVET SIZE,BEL IT DEPENDS ON THE SID OF COURI THRMASIE
9477,THAT'S REALLY WEIRD,THATRELE
9478,WRAP IT WITH WIRES AND CONNECT IT TO BATTERIES AND,WIHWIRES  COLECT   ER
9479,THAT'D BE LIKE THE FIRST LINE,LIKE THE FIST
9480,TODAY WE MADE AN ELECTROMAGNET YEAH,SING WE MA AN ILLET MAMINT
9481,UM THAT THE BEGINNING IT STARTED OFF REALLY SMALL AND THEN IT GOT BIGGER AND THEN HUGER,THTHE BEGI STARTED A REALLY SMOLL WH T BIGERN HUMR
9482,IT LOOKED LIKE LIKE,ILOOD LIKE
9483,YEAH,
9484,THEY BOTH PICK UP IRON THINGS,MABELE PIC OUP IR THANKS
9485,UM WHAT SURPRISED ME WAS THAT TEN WRAPS WOULD PICK UP ONLY TWO,ASPRICET ME WA TH TEN RAMPTS  KONLY TWO
9486,UM YEAH I THINK HE USED AN ELECTROMAGNET BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT WHAT WE READ BEFORE WE DID THE ELECTROMAGNET SO IT'S PROBABLY WHAT HE USED,I THINK H IS UTBCWE READ H U E MTHE
9487,WRAPS,A
9488,WELL BECAU WE HAD A THOUSAND TEN BUT WE ALSO HAD THIS UM CUP THAT WAS A HUNDRED SO WE USED THAT TOO SO I SORTA YOU KNOW,WEVE HAD THOUSND TENWE ALSOE HAD A PS DREDSURTHAT T  OR
9489,YEAH BECAUSE YOU KNOW IT'S A HUNDRED SO YOU KNOW IT'S GONNA BE RIGHT THERE BUT YOU'D HAVE TO DO IT TEN TIMES SO YEAH,BCAUS O NOTES A HDRSRO I CBE A RI TAWYOVE HAVE TO DWIT TEN TIMS
9490,N MMM NOT REALLY,O
9491,UH ONE HUNDRED MILLILITERS FILLS UP THAT,N LEADER IUP
9492,WELL IT'S IT'S IT'S THE SAME THING AS THE OTHER ONE EXCEPT THEY JUST FLIPPED UP,THE SAME THING AS THE OTHER WONESIONLITUP
9493,THANKS,THANKS
9494,MMM NOT REALLY CAUSE WE ALL HAD DIFFERENT BOTTLES EVERY GROUP SO NOT REALLY MMM HMM,T ECAUS WE OL HAD DIFRNT BOUTERES EVERY GROOPS
9495,WELL BECAUSE THE IF YOU USE THE SAME SIZE EVERYONE WOULD HAVE THE SAME ANSWER BASICALLY UNLESS ONE'S WIDER,CAUS OU LISCED THE SAME SIS EVERY ON WILL HAVE THE SAME ERNLE ONE  WITER
9496,MMM HMM YEAH UH HUH YEP,
9497,WELL THIS IS ONE MILLILITER THIS IS ONE HUNDRED MILLILITERS AND THIS IS LIKE A THOUSAND SO YOU CAN LIKE SEE THE HUGE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THEM,THS ONE LEADER THIS S N K A THOUSUR YOU CAN SE THE H DIFRINCS BETWEEN THEM
9498,UM I'M NOT SURE HOW MANY TIMES BUT,I 'M NOT SORE T MNY TIMES
9499,NO NOT REALLY IT WAS IT WAS UM JUST LIKE UM SEVEN UP BOTTLES NOT CANS BUT BOTTLES LIKE THE BO THE BIG BOTTLES YEAH,UST LIKE ON SEVEN TANS BATERES L TTHE BIG BTES
9500,YEAH IT SORTA WAS,WEVHAD SORT
9501,THE LAST ONE,FNE
9502,TWO HUNDRED,TO
9503,YEAH ONE MILLILITER,ONEML
9504,YEAH I GUESS,G
9505,SO SO YOU'RE MORE,S
9506,HUH WELL THEN PROBABLY HAVE THE SAME THING TWICE,VRTEN POBLY HAVES TSE ME TWICE
9507,NOT ALL THE WAY NOT ALL THE WAY,WAWA
9508,MMM NOT REALLY,RALLY
9509,REALLY YEAH,RELYU
9510,THAT'S A F THAT'S A UM,THTAM
9511,I THINK IT JUST IS TRYING TO TRICK US BUT Y YOU JUST DID THAT ONE YOU ALREADY DID THAT ONE,I TANUIS TRY TO CK US OWN
9512,THE LINES WELL UM THEY THEY JUST TELL YOU HOW MUCH HOW FULL IT WOULD BE IT,THUST TELL YOU HO MUCH AFORIB
9513,WELL BECAUSE WE WANTED TO KEEP TRACK SO WE W SO WE WOULDN'T LIKE GET CONFUSED SO YEAH THAT'S,BCAS WE ANTED TO CEP TRUCK SRT COUEO
9514,YEAH CAUSE I DON'T REALLY THINK YOU COULD PUT THE TOP IN THERE ANYWAYS,COUL NOT RELLY THINKPUTTOP IN THE ANY WAE
9515,YES NO IT DOESN'T LOOK THE SAME BUT IT IS THE SAME BECAUSE IT'S JUST THAT THIS IS MORE TALLER AND THIS IS MORE WIDER BUT IF YOU LIKE IF YOU LIKE SHRUNK THIS INTO THAT IT WOULD BE THE SAME,DUSN'T  THE SAME IS THE SAME BECAUS UI IS O ALLERR LK O LIKES RTW BE THE SAME
9516,YEAH,
9517,MMM NO I DON'T THINK SO SO IT'S JUST SHOWING TEN TEN A HUNDREDS WOULD FIT IN A THOUSAND,WL THINK SOWSIR   S TEN TEN HONDRED  FIT A THOUSOND
9518,YEAH,
9519,THIS WELL THAT'S THE FULCRUM AND IT'S THE PART WHERE WHERE YOU PUT THE BALANCE ON LIKE AND IT'S WHERE YOU GET IT LIKE EVEN,GRAMTHWI YOU PUT THE BALINE SWEAR OU
9520,YEAH,
9521,UM WELL I'M,SUMWA
9522,YEAH,E
9523,WELL,WOOLEN
9524,WELL WELL A GRAM IT'S,ILLAM I
9525,UM WE'RE WE WERE UM STUDYING MASS AND UM LIKE AND WE'RE LIKE USING GRAMS AND THAT STUFF UM,ERD WE AR ON A STARTING MASS  IE VUSING RSOM A
9526,MMM NO,
9527,YEAH YEAH,SUBGEST
9528,WE'RE WORKING WITH THAT THAT AND THAT,WO ING IH
9529,A BIG ONE EQUAL YEAH A BIG ONE EQUALS A GRAM,BIGES AM
9530,NO WELL THAT'S NOT ONE GRAM THE WELL THE LITTLE ONES ARE FIVE GRAMS THE LITTLEST ONES LIKE THAT LOOK LIKE THAT ARE FIVE GRAMS AND THEN THE BIGGER ONES ARE A LITTLE BIG BIGGER THAN THAT,THAONE RAM  THE LITL WONES ARE FIVE GRAMHE LKES TLOOKED LIKE THAT A FIVE GRAMTHE BIGER ON A BIG BIGER  TAT
9531,NO NOT YET,NOTYET
9532,I PROBABLY USE THAT INSTEAD OF A WHOLE BUNCH OF THOSE CAUSE THAT'S LIKE WAY BIGGER THAN THAT SO THAT ONE'S PROBABLY A BETTER LIKE THING TO PUT IN THE CUPS AND YOU KNOW,VE THATINSTED O BMO CAUS AT  BIGERS TATONS POBBLY A BERTHINS UT IN H
9533,MMM HMM AND THEN I PUT IN THE BAG AND I WAITED UNTIL IT GOT LIKE UM LEVEL AND IT,M  T PUT IN THE BWATEDNTL AK ALEVER
9534,YEAH W F FIRST I HOLD IT IN MY HANDS AND I WEIGH IT AND THEN I PUT IT IN IT AND THEN I GUESS,S I HOLD IN MY HANDS  PGEST
9535,NO NOT REALLY,LY
9536,AND WE'RE LEARNING ABOUT LIKE THE BASE THE FULCRUM AND THE BALANCE,ND WE ARING ABOUT LK  ASE TITHE BALON
9537,NO WE HAVEN'T,W
9538,YEAH THIS IS LIKE EXACTLY WHAT WE USE,I AA WWE OE
9539,YEAH,
9540,OH YEAH AND UM IT'S JUST BECAUSE IF IT'S LIKE WAY DOWN HERE YOU WOULDN'T GUESS LIKE ONE GRAM BECAUSE HOW COULD THAT BE POSSIBLE,I JUST BECAS S LIKES MDOMHER DOT GET LIKE ONE RABECASE HOCAN THAEPBL
9541,WELL UM WE JUST DO ESTIMATES LIKE UM UH EDUCT EDUCATED GUESS AND,WWE'L JUST SDUOPE ESTOMITS LIKE A EGECATED GS
9542,WELL IT JUST UM LET'S THE BALANCE UM S IT MAKES IT STEADY AND NOT LIKE WIBBLE WOBBY,THE BALENTMAS STADY IN OTS LIKE BOL
9543,IT SEEMS LIKE THIS IS A THOUSAND OF THOSE GRAM PIECES AND THEN THIS IS PROBABLY IF YOU STICK EM ALL TOGETHER LIKE REALLY TIGHT IT'D PROBABLY EQUAL THAT,SIKE   A THOUSOND CRAMOALL TO GETHER  L
9544,PARTICLE SIZE AND MAGNETISM,HARTACLE SES I
9545,THE IMPORTANT PROPERTY IS MAGNETISM,THE IMPRT OPERTY I ETS
9546,I SAW THAT THE SAND I THINK WENT STAYED ON THE TOP OF THE FILTER WHEN THE WATER AND SALT WENT THROUGH,I SSTAM ON THE TOP T W THE WATER IN HE WENT THROU

9549,THE THE PAPER CLIPS ARE GOING TO THE MAGNET BECAUSE THEY HAVE MAGNETISM,THE PEOPLE CLAES ARE GOWIN TO MAMONT BECAUSE THEY HA OIKS
9550,I NOTICED THAT NONE OF THE OTHER THINGS WOULD GO WITH THE MAGNET,I NOTIS TETHE OTHER THINGS ULD GO WITH A
9551,BECAUSE THE STONES ARE BIGGER THAN THEIR PARTICLE SIZE IS BIGGER THAN THE HOLES IN THE SEAM THING WHATEVER YOU SAID,BECAUS THSTONAR BIGERS IN TH TH ODICLE SISE IS ICLD IN THE HORLES IN THE ALMS TINKS WTEVER YOU D
9552,WE CAN SEPARATE MIXTURES BY USING MAGNETS FILTERS AND EVAPORATION,WE CAN SEPERAT MISTOES OSING AIN OPERATION
9553,THINK WE USED UM A DIFFERENT THING BECAUSE THERE ARE PAPER CLIPS WHICH HAVE MAGNETITE IN THEM SO THEY WOULD GO WITH THE MAGNET INSTEAD OF JUST STAYING WITH OTHERS,I TKIN BECAS ABRWMETIN THE SARY WGO WITH THE FRAMENTENSTEDT STAYING WITH EATHERES
9554,DON'T GO MARNI BYE,
9555,I DIDN'T NOTICE ANYTHING ELSE BUT I BUT I THINK WE USE THE FILTER BECAUSE THE STUFF STAYED ON TOP,I DIDN'T NOTIS NEY THING I THINK WE USE C C R BECATFSTAED  THE TOPS
9556,IT IS A SOLUTION,ILLUSION
9557,I NOTICED THAT THE SIEVE STAYED ON TOP OF THE UM THE FILTER WHEN THE OTHERS THINGS WENT DOWN,NOTUST TE SED STAD ON NTHE OTHER STS WENT DOWN
9558,NO,
9559,SURE IT TWO TWO THINGS THAT KEEP THEIR PROPERTY,TWO THNKS MIT TO GATHER PPR

9561,YES,YELL
9562,WE BEEN TALKING ABOUT MIXTURES AND SOLUTIONS,WEENT TALKNABOUT MICTURES  LLUSION

9564,PROPERTY THAT'S BEING SHOWN IS PARTICLE SIZE,POPERLY  L
9565,I NOTICED THAT THE PAPER CLIPS WENT WITH THE MAGNET BECAUSE THEY HAVE MAGNETITE IN THEM,I NOTS THET THE APER SW WIT MAMENT BECAUSE THE AT
9566,OKAY,OCAY
9567,THE ONE I PICKED WAS THE SALT BECAUSE IT'S BEST FOR EVAPORATING TO MAKE SALT CRYSTALS,NI PAD TBECAUSE I ATH F VPERATING TOMAKE CISTLES
9568,THAT MEANS WELL MAKING THE WATER NOT UM GO UM WELL IT'S JUST MAKING THE WATER DISAPPEAR TO MAKE THE SALT COME,THAT MENS MAKING TH WATER E UMIMAKING THE WATER DOUS APEAR TOAK THE VET COM

10111,WELL IT ALSO STARTS FROM COMING OUT THE NEGATIVE AND THEN IT GOES THROUGH THE POSITIVE AGAIN AND THEN COMES OUT THE NEGATIVE ON BOTH ENDS IT MAKES THE CIRCUIT,ALSO STARTES FROM CUMOPTHENA TIRPST VIUMSO THE NAGDVBTMAKS THE CIRCUS
10112,IF IF NOT A PARALLEL CIRCUIT THAT MEANS THAT THERE IS ONLY ONE CIRCUIT AND IT HAS TO BE AN OP CLOSED CIRCUIT,I IS NOT A PEARLBL CIRCUS THAT MEANS THE THEIS ONLY A ONE CIRCUSITHAB IN CLOSE CIRCUS
10113,THAT UM IF THE OP THE CIRCUIT WAS OPEN THEN THE LIGHT WOULDN'T WORK,TTE CIRCUS WAS OPEN THEN THE LIGHTE OULD NOT WARK
10114,BECAUSE IF THERE'S MORE OF WIRES IT WILL MAKE THE LIGHT STRONGER,BECAUSE IHI IOR IT WILL MAK THE LE STROWNGER
10115,WE HAVE BEEN TRYING TO LIGHT TWO PARALLEL CIRCUITS,WE HAVE BEN TRYN THO LI TO PASIRCUT
10116,IT'S A CLOSED CIRCUIT AND THE THE ENERGY IS GOING THROUGH THE LIGHT BULBS AND INTO THE BATTERY,IS A CLOSE CIRCUS IND THE THE EMAGY IS GOWIN THROW THE LABOBS INTO THE BATTERY
10117,ONE CIRCUIT IS GOING TO THE LEFT AND THE OTHER ONE IS GOING TO THE RIGHT AND THE D CELL IS SPLITTING UP IT'S POWER,ONE CIRCG TE LEFT IN THE OTHER THE DE SALLS P POUR
10118,THE BATTERY'S IN THE MIDDLE OF THE TWO LIGHT BULBS THAT ARE CONNECTED WITH WIRES,THE BATTERY IS IN THE MIDL THE TOLBL ATER CONECTED WITH WAIRES

10120,THE PARALLEL CIRCUITS WORK WITH MULTIPLE WIRES CONNECTING TO THE LIGHT BULB TO MAKE IT BRIGHTER,TE O SERCUSKTD WITH MALTBLE WATERS CONECTING TO THE LABL BRITER
10121,PARALLEL CIRCUITS ARE WHEN THERE ARE TWO OR MORE CIRCUITS CONNECTED TO THE BATTERY AND THE LIGHT BULBS LIGHT AND THE MOTORS WORK,PURLIRCUS A WIN THE TWO O SIRCUS COUNDECTED WIT THE BATTERY IN THE SLIE H
10122,IT'S A PARALLEL CIRCUIT BECAUSE THERE'S TWO OR MORE WI WIRES TO MAKE A LIGHT BULB LIGHT,SIRCUST BECAUSE  TWO OR OWIRE MI ABPLAE
10123,THE CIRCUIT IS GO IS MAKING A CLOSED CIRCUIT BECAUSE THERE ARE AREN'T ANY HOLES,THE CIRCUS IS MAKING A CLOSE CIRCUST BECUSE TH  HOLD
10124,THE TWO WIRES ARE CONNECTING TO THE LIGHT BULB AND THE OTHER TWO WIRES ARE CONNECTING TO THE OTHER WIRE LIGHT BULB AND IT IS PROVIDING POWER,THTO ARES AR CONECTENG TO THE LAIEBTHE OTHER TO BARES AR CONECT TO THE ERN POUR
10125,IT'S A PARALLEL CIRCUIT AND BOTH LIGHT BULBS ARE LIGHTING FROM FOUR WIRES,IS A PEARRB CIRCUS OND BOTH LIBLES ARE LITING FROM FOUR R
10126,IT FLOWS THROUGH THE LIGHT BULBS AND UM IT IT COMES FROM THE D CELL THAT GOES INTO THE LIGHT BULBS,IT FLOWS THROW THE LAMEBLS AND IT CAUMS FROM THE DESA GOWS IN TO THE LABADS
10127,GOOD,JUD
10128,UM IT PARALLEL CIRCUITS ARE IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT WILL GIVE YOU MORE LIGHT AND UM IT'LL S GIVE YOU MORE ELECTRICITY,PACIRCUS ARE UNPORTN BECAS IT WILL GIVES YOU  LIHT AND GVE YOU MOR ELLECTISOTY

10130,OKAY,OGAY
10131,BYE,
10132,BECAUSE IT LIGHTS UP MORE THAN TWO LIGHT BULBS AND IT PROVIDES MORE LIGHT,BECAUSE IT LIE MOR TH T LAYBOLS VIS ETE
10133,THAT THE ENERGY GOES THROUGH THE LIGHT BULB AND GOES AND MAKES LIGHT,THAT THE IMAGERY GOWS THROW THE LIPBERD ND O
10134,THE MAGNETS ARE PUT TOGETHER AND YOU ARE PUTTING THE WAFER INTO THE CUP,THE ABTS AR PUT TO GTHER IN OUUTIN THE ASER IN TTHE CUP
10135,THEY MAKE THE MAGNETS UM HOLD LESS BECAUSE THE MAGNET FIELD CAN'T CAN'T HOLD THAT MUCH,THE MAKE THE RADT UM HRE TST BECAUSE THE FNIT FIELD CAN HOLD THAT MUCH
10136,THE SPACERS HOLD THE MAGNETS AND THEY MAKE THEM REPEL,THE SPASZEORS OD THE ANT   RPEABL
10137,CAN USE SPACERS AND ANYTHING THAT'S IRON OR STEEL,YOU CAN  SPAZARS IN ENE THING H IRND HI ELE
10138,THE UM WHEN THERE'S MORE WAFERS IT CAN'T HOLD THAT MUCH AND IT'S HARDER TO HOLD THE UM WAFERS,WHEN THERS MORVABERS IT CAT HOLD THAT MUNCH ND IT ARDE TO  BERT
10139,WE STACKED THE SPACERS ON TOP OF UM UH MAGNET AND SEE HOW MANY IT WOULD T TAKE,WE STACK THE SPASERES ONH TOP  FRAMT AD SE HO MON ITAKES
10140,WELL WHEN THE TWO MAGNETS ARE TOGETHER THEY ARE ATTRACTING AND THAT HOLDS MORE WEIGHT,WHEN THE TOO MADS ARTTH TRACTTOL MY D
10141,PROBABLY FOUR OR FIVE,BL FOUR RFIVE
10142,UM THE WHEN THERE IS LESS WAFERS NO LESS SPACERS IT'S EASIER TO HOLD THE WAFERS,HWHEN THER I E AT IS EASIER TO HOLD THE AVER
10143,WHEN THEY ADD THE TWO OTHER,NTHE AD  TWO OTHER
10144,THE SPACER IS UM KIND OF REPELLING THE TWO MAGNETS AND SORT OF UM KEEPING THEM TOGETHER,THE SPASER IS ANPELING THE TWO MAGMT AND SORT OF MCEPING TEM TOGETHER
10145,A SPACER IS PLASTIC AND NOT IRON OR STEEL,THE BA R I PASSA  NOT  IN THE FIELD
10146,UM IT WOULD PROBABLY BE SIX OR SEVEN,CILL OLY BE SIX OR SEVEN
10147,YES,YES
10148,YES,YES

10154,YEAH,YELLOW
10155,THEY'RE HOLDING THE THE WAFERS AND THE TWO MAGNETS ARE HOLDING IT TOGETHER,HOLDIN TH THE A THE TWO MAOS AR OLING TO GETHER
10156,A MAGNET WILL ATTRACT TO IRON AND STEEL AND IF YOU F FLIP ONE OF THE MAGNETS OVER THEY'LL REPEL,WILL I TRACT TO I T STEAM LIT ON O THE MANONS OVERTHE
10157,YES,GEST
10158,IT WOULD STICK TO THE MAGNETS AND IT WOULD BE HA IT'D BE EASIER TO PUT THE WAFERS IN,IT W STICK TO TH MAO  IL BE EASIER TO PUT THE WAPRESENT
10159,YES,ET
10160,IN ONE OF THE SPACERS WE HAD TEN,THE SPAZIOWE HAD TEN
10161,THE MAGNETS BECOME WEAKER AND IT CAN'T HOLD MUCH,THE BECAUME WEAKER ND IT AN HOLD MUCH
10162,GOOD,OOD
10163,WE ALSO HAD NINETEEN,WE LSO HAD NINE TEN
10164,I'M PRETTY SURE,EASURE
10165,YES,GEST
10166,WE HAVE BEEN DOING MAGNETS,EVEN DUING MRAGINTS
10167,THE METAL THE MAGNET ONLY STICKS ON TO THE METAL AND STEEL BECAUSE IT HAS A MAGNET POLE AND THE SPONGE DOESN'T HAVE METAL OR STEEL IN IT,THAGT ONLY SIX ON TO THE MEDO  STER BECAUS AS A MIT ESPUN DOESN'T HAVE STE INIT
10168,WE DID WORK WITH ROUND MAGNETS TODAY,WE DIDN'T WEARK WITH AGMENTS TODAY
10169,ATTRACT HAS A MAGNET POLE THAT MAKES THEM CLOSER AND STUCK TOGETHER,THE TRAPT HAS A MAIT THBIKS THEM CLOWSER ND STUK TOA GETHER
10170,YES,YES
10171,STEEL STICKS ON TO THE MAGNET AND THE ALUMINIUM DIDN'T STICK ON WHEN THE MAGNET HOVERED OVER THE ALUMINUM,ELD STICKS O H THEDIDN'T STICK WH MAT HVERD OVER THE LUMNAB
10172,UM ONE OF THE SIDES HAS A UM A PIECE THAT WON'T STICK AND THE OTHER SIDE HAS A MAGNETIC POLE,ONE E SIDE AS A UMA PESE TT STICK IN THE OTHER SIDE PANETIC PLB
10173,NO,NOWE
10174,BECAUSE SOME OF SOME PARTS OF THE METAL DOESN'T ATTRACT BECAUSE UM WHEN THEY'RE OPPOSITES THEY DON'T REALLY STICK TOGETHER,BECAUSSOME PARTOF THE MEDOW DOESN'T ATRACT BECASWIN THER OPESIT THAY DON'T REALLY STICK TO GATHERE
10175,ATTRACT HAS UM A POLE AND REPEL HAS A PART OF THE METAL THAT WON'T STICK TOGETHER,TRACT AS A OLL IN PL AS A PART OF THE METOW THT  STICK TO GATHERE
10176,BECAUSE THEY ARE UM BEING ATTRACTED BY THE MAGNETIC POLE,BECAUSE THM BING ABTRACTED BY THE ICNIPOLE
10177,AND I DON'T REMEMBER THE OTHER ONE,ANDI DON'T AME MEM R THE OTHER WISE
10178,GOOD,GOOD
10179,THEY ATTRACT THEY STICK TOGETHER AND WHEN THEY REPEL THEY DON'T WANT TO GET BY,THEY  TRACT A STIC TOEND WHEN THEY RPELL TH DOT  GET CLOTHE
10180,THE ALUMINUM DOESN'T STICK ON TO THE METAL BECAUSE UM ALUMINIUM IS A PART OF STEEL BUT IT DOESN'T HAVE A MAGNET POLE IN IT,THE ALLUMOME DOESN'T STICK ON TO THE MEDOW BECAS  ALLMIS ART O STEIT DOESNT HAVE A MAICE B

10490,WELL I CAN'T REALLY TELL THE DIFFERENCE,I CAT RELY TELTH OU FINDS
10491,GRAM WEIGHTS IN THE OTHER CUP BY THE SPONGE AND IT WAS EQUAL,AT GRAM ATES IN THE OTHER CUPBUY THE SPUNH D  WAS EACWL
10492,IT'S ABSORBED AS MUCH AS IT CAN AND SO THAT'S COMING OUT OF IT BECAUSE IT LOOKS LIKE IT WAS JUST PULLED OUT OF THE WATER AND PUT IN THE CUP AND SO THE WATER'S POOLING AROUND IT BECAUSE THAT WATER CAME WITH IT,BZARBE AS MUCH SIT NTAUMNG ITIT LOKES LIKE JUST PL OUT THE WATERPT UPTH WATERPYNGBECAS THWATER
10493,THE SPONGE HAS ABSORBED WATER AND SO IT'S TIPPING THE BALANCE SCALE,TH L HAS ABZORBWATER SE
10494,IT ISN'T VERY BIG BECAUSE IT DOESN'T HAVE WATER IN IT BECAUSE WATER FILLS IT UP AND MAKES IT BIGGER,ISN'T VERY BIG BECAUS IT DOUSNT  BECAUSE WATER ILS IT UP AN MAS IT BIGER
10495,IF IT'S SORT OF HARDISH THEN YOU KNOW IT'S ISN'T WET BECAUSE WATER MAKES IT MOVE AROUND MORE EASILY,IS SORT  ARD NOWBECAUSE WATER MAKES IT VOWN MOR EASLY
10496,GOOD,GOOD
10497,WE HAVE BEEN STUDYING HOW MUCH SPONGES CAN ABSORB,WE'VE HAVE BIN STUDYING HO MUCH SPUNES AL ABSARBE
10498,WE WERE MEASURING HOW MUCH IT WEIGHED WITH WATER AND WITHOUT WATER AND HOW MUCH WATER IT COULD GET,WE A MRING OMUCH A WITH WATER ERMUSH WATER

10853,IT TELLS YOU THAT IT'S THE WIDTH IS A CENTIMETER,TL  I MATOR
10854,WE DIDN'T MEASURE ANYTHING ELSE EXCEPT FOR OUR,DOIDN'T MAR ENEY THING OCE XP
10855,WELL YOU KNOW HOW WIDE IT IS SO YOU KNOW THAT IF IT'S A CENTIMETER YOU CAN USE THAT TO MEASURE A TABLE OR A COMPUTER OR YOUR HEAD AND STUFF LIKE,E WE I S O ISMATER OU  AS THAT TMASR TABEL A COMPUTER OR
10856,WHAT DO YOU MEAN ABOUT TELLING YOU MORE ABOUT THAT,WHD YOU MEAN ABOUT TELLING NU BOUT THAT
10857,WE DON'T USE MILLIMETERS,DON'T LAUS MELLOBATORS
10858,U CAN USE UM YARD STICK OR UM A,HI C SE ME YARD STIAK O A
10859,YOU USE EM TO MEASURE STUFF THAT'S SHORTER NOT LONGER BECAUSE IF IT'S SH LONGER IT WILL TAKE A LONG,I ST NONGER BECASE ONGAK O
10860,I NOTICED THEY'RE ALL DIFFERENT S,
10861,METER TAPE BECAUSE IT CAN GO AROUND STUFF AS THE METER STICK IT'S JUST REALLY SOLID AND YOU CAN'T GET IT TO BEN,BECAUSE IT CAN GO A RO S THE MEATE STAKS IS JUST REALLY SOLLO YOU  ETT  B

10864,NONE WERE THE SAME,UNWLTHSSAE
10865,THE METRIC,TEAIC
10866,WELL THEY'RE ALL THERE'S A LINE FOR EVERY CEN CENTIMETE,THEIRS A LINE FOR EVERY EVEN EAGHT
10867,WE ONLY USED THE METER TAPE AND A METER STICK AND THAT'S ALL AND WE DIDN'T MEASURE OUR NOSE,WE LY YUSED THE MATER  MATERN
10868,WELL IT IF YOU DON'T HAVE ANYTHING YOU'VE GOTTA USE A REFERENCE SO YOU CAN MEASURE BUT YOU'RE NOT EXACTLY SURE IF IT'S EXACTLY PRECISE ON,IFYOU DON'T HAVE NNG A SREVRACLY SURA SONG
10869,ARM SPANNED IS THE SAME AS HIS HEIGHT,ARMS PSTHE SAME
10870,WE HAVEN'T MEASURED ANYTHING EXCEPT FOR OUR HEIGHT AND OUR ARM,WEAVMEZRED NEY THINGSTR
10871,WELL YOU USE UM DIFFERENT MEASURING TOOLS TO MEASURE IT IF YOU DON'T HAVE MEASURING TOOLS YOU SHOULD USE REFERENCES,LMAIG TLES TO ASER MASRING LO AS REVRENES
10872,WELL WE DON'T USE MILLIMETERS WE ONLY USE CENTIMETERS,HE WILL MEAT SEMASHORT MSERMENT
10873,LISTEN WE HAVEN'T USED ANY TOOLS EXCEPT FOR A LITTLE CUP,WE HAVE ATER TB
10874,BECAUSE THERE'S MILLILITERS AND LITERS THAT'S ALL,ECAUS THELEADER
10875,HOW MUCH WATER IT CAN HOLD,HO MUCH WATER IT CAN HOLD
10876,YOU GET DIFFERENT NUMBERS BECAUSE SOME ARE SMALLER AND THEN YOU GET HIGHER NUMBERS SOME ARE BIGGER AND THEN YOU GET A BIGGER NUMBER,I
10877,LET ME SEE WE DIDN'T USE ANY TOOLS OKAY,DIDNBUSE  TL ZOKAY
10878,I DON'T KNOW I DON'T KNOW AT ALL,O'T NOWOT ALL
10879,WE ALREADY WENT OVER THAT OKAY SO STOP ASKING ME THAT SAME QUES,WE' ALY WEMT OVER TH OAS

11596,WE'VE BEEN USING GRADUATED CYLINDERS TO MEASURE HOW MUCH SOMETHING IS LIKE THE CAPACITY OF IT,WE'VE BIN ZSIN GRAOWATED ILLDERE TMHO MUCH SOMTHING LIKE THE CPAST
11597,I I SEE THAT THE METAL CHIP IS MORE THAN THE PLASTIC CHIP,I S T MEATDEL SHIP IS MOR THEN THE CLASTARK HI
11598,GOOD,
11599,I KNOW THAT HOW ONE IS MORE IN ONE CUP IT MEANS THAT ONE HAS MORE MASS INSIDE OF IT THAN THE OTHER,ONE N ONE CIT MEANS THAT ONE HAS MOUR MAS INSIDE OF RIT THEN THE OTHER
11600,THAT IF ONE IS METAL AND ONE IS PLASTIC THE METAL ONE WOULD PROBABLY BE MORE WEIGHT,OEEO I THE MET  WIL PROBL BE
11601,BYE I WAS I HAVE TO GO RIGHT NOW SO HOPEFULLY I CAN SEE YOU NEXT TIME,RARLI CAN SE OU NEXT TIME
11602,MAY YOU REPEAT THAT AGAIN,REPETA
11603,I HAVE BEEN DOING BALANCES WHERE YOU WEIGH SOMETHING,BALNCIS WI OU A SOMTHING
11604,WHAT YOU COULD DO IS YOU COULD LOOK AT ALL EM AND THEN GET A BALANCE AND THEN WEIGH WHICH ONE IS HEAVIER THAN THE OTHER,YOU CAN LOOK AT ELE BALLNH ONE IS HEVYIER THN THE OTHER
11605,IT WOULD MAKE IT NON ACCURATE BECAUSE ONE IS BIGGER AND ONE IS SMALLER SO YOU WOULD HAVE TO USE MORE SMALLER ONES TO ADD UP THE BIGLER ONE,EAROT BECAUSE ONE IS BIGR TIN N YO WILL HAVE TO  O SMOLLERON THE BIGO
11606,ACCURATE MEASUREMENTS IS THAT IT MEANS ACCURATE MEANS LIKE IT'S KINDA RIGHT ON TRACK,EDMESERMONT I THMNS ARAT S LKE TCIS OF RIT ON
11607,WAIT TELL ME THIS ARE YOU GETTING ANYTHING YOU'RE SAYING,ARE YOU ING NY THING OU INS
11608,ONE BIG PAPER CLIP AND ONE SMALL PAPER CLIP,BIGPAPER IN SLLO
11609,OKAY,OAY
11610,BECAUSE UM WHEN LIKE ANIMALS DIE THEY'RE THEY'RE JUST THEIR BONES SO THEN THEY EAT ALL OF THAT TO BREAK THE BONES DOWN,BECAS  LIKE ANMLS DY THER RUS EAALLEA THE NS DOWN
11611,IT'S BECAUSE IT'S LIKE THE ONLY FOOD THEY EAT CAUSE JUST SOME PEOPLE JUST ARE LIKE KINDA LIKE A VEGETARIAN SO THEY JUST EAT LIKE YOU KNOW,CASLIKE ONLY THECAUS UT SOME PEOPLE URI  V
11612,I DON'T KNOW HOW TO SPEAK BUT KINDA LIKE A VEGETARIAN,IDON'T NOW HO  A VION
11613,I THINK THEY GET THEIR ENERGY FROM WHEN THEY EAT BONES AND BREAK THEM DOWN,I THINK THA GETS EENARGY RMTHE POMONS CRAKES THEM DOWN
11614,THEY ATE ALL THAT PAPER AND LEAVE AND WHEN ONCE THEY POOPED IT OUT IT TURNED INTO SOIL,TAY A ALL THT PAPER NTHE TURN IN TTHE STO
11615,I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE WORD IS BUT I THINK IT'S ANOTHER WORD TO DESCRIBE IT IS LIKE VEGETARIAN,T NOWTHE ANOTHER TOUCP  K VEETARIONS
11616,I THINK IT JUST A CONSUMER IS ALL KIND OF ALL ABOUT EATING TO SURVIVE,I THINK JUST E CM AOLB EATING  SIRVIVE
11617,SO WE HAVE A HEALTHIER PLANET,SUR WEVE HA A F PLA
11618,I BEEN LEARNING ABOUT THE FOOD WEB PRODUCERS UM DECOMPOSER AND CONSUMERS,IVEBEN LEARNING ABOUT THE BUATDUER COMPSERE IN OMR
11619,IT'S A DECOMPOSER,EMPOSERE
11620,A BEAR WHAT IT MEANS TO ME IT IS AN OMNIVORE,WIT MEANS TOME IS AN ANR VOUR
11621,IT EATS LIKE UM SNOW WHITE RABBITS AND THAT WHITE COUNT LOOK LIKE A HAMSTER,EATS IKE SOM SNOWWI RABETS IN THAT CLK LIKE A AMPSTARE
11622,I THINK IT'S KINDA LIKE A VEGETARIAN FOR SOME PEOPLE,I THINK IT CAN LEG ERION FOR SOME PEOPLE
11623,MAKES THEM A DECOMPOSER,MAKE SOME A DCOMPOSIOURE
11624,SO THEY AREN'T ALL THE SAME LIKE SOME ARE VEGETARIAN AND SOME ARE MEAT EATERS,TH ALZAM LIK SOME VTEARION IN SOMEAA
11625,IT TELLS ME NOT LIKE US HUMANS OR CARNIVORE OR HERBIVORES THEY DON'T EAT THAT KIND OF STUFF ONLY DECOMPOSER EAT THAT KIND OF STUFF,IT TELLS ME AHUMON OTEATONLY COMPSTSTU
11626,A PLANT LIKE GROWS IT'S OWN FOOD THROUGH PHOTOSYNTHESIS KINDA LIKE A CYCLE OR ECOSYSTEM AND IT'S KINDA LIKE AN EVOLUTION,THE PLAN  GROWS S  THR    SIESISTUMEAND  CVALSION
11627,IT'S KINDA LIKE WHEN WE RECYCLE AND THROW AWAY TRASH,CAO WHEN WE SI TOWASH
11628,I THINK IT WHAT IT HAS TO DO IS LIKE UM,I THINK WA HAS WE I E AM
11629,ANIMALS GET THEIR ENERGY FROM THE PRODUCERS FROM LIKE EATING AND DRINKING AND KINDA LIKE ENERGY FROM THE SUN LIKE JUST LIKE PRODUCERS MAYBE,ANMLES GET THE ENERGY FROM THE USEAR FROM  EATING DRINLIC ENEARGY FROM THE SA
11630,IT'S BECAUSE THEY DON'T EAT ANYTHING AND THEY JUST MAKE THEIR OWN FOOD SO LIKE THE CONSUMERS COULD EAT THEM,BCAST EAT NEY THING  TH JUST MAKE HEROD SSET THEM
11631,THEY EAT IT ALL AND THEN ONCE THEY POOP IT OUT IT TURNS INTO SOIL,THEY EAT WTHE PTURNS IN TH SOYO
11632,A CARNIVORE IS LIKE THE LION AND THE POLAR BEAR THEY ONLY EAT MEAT,A  LIKE A LI ITET
11633,I THINK THEY EAT UM EAT GRASS WHICH IS ON THE RIGHT OF THE TOP FRONT PICTURE,I THINK THERAFS WC THE RENAURE
11634,A WORMS ARE UM THEY ARE A DECOMPOSER WHICH THEY BREAK DOWN STUFF LIKE UM THOSE THE D THING,THWARM ON THE AEADTHEY COMPZER ICH THY B WSTUBE NI
11635,I THINK THEY EAT KINDA LIKE TRASH AND BROKEN DOWN BONES AND MOSTLY AND THEN THEY TURN THAT INTO SOIL,I THINK THE EA CRASH IN BROKAN DOWMLTHEY TURN THAINT HE S
11636,THAT MAKES IT A HERBIVORE BECAUSE IT ONLY EATS MEAT,THAT MAKS  HERBO BECAUS ITLY STS
11637,I THINK IT BREAKS STUFF DOWN,I THKB OWN
11638,IT IS AN OMNIVORE JUST LIKE US HUMANS IT EATS MEAT AND PLANT,S  NUST LIKE A HUMO ATS N PLATS
11639,A PRODUCER GOES THROUGH IT'S PHOTOSYNTHESIS IT MAKES IT'S OWN FOOD IT DOESN'T EAT ANYTHING,E PRCO SANFISN S UDOESNT EAT NE THING
11640,CONSUMER IS LIKE WHAT IT EATS AND LIKE WHAT THEIR ENEMIES EAT THEM,CUHUMOR ISKE WEATS LE WTHER TA
11641,I THINK IS WHAT EATS WHAT,I THINK W  WHTE
11642,THEY BREAK DOWN SO IT COULD TURN INTO ORGANIC OR SOIL,THE BTHTR TO ORGANTIC
11643,LIKE HUMANS AND BEARS THEY EAT MEAT AND PLANTS,LIKE U MIS VTHE MEAT  PLANTS
11644,GOOD,OOD
11645,I NOTICE ALL THE TRASH AND LEAVES HAVE BEEN SHORTENED THAT MEANS IT TOOK IT DAYS OR WEEKS OR MAYBE YEARS,UNOUTS ALL THE RAOUM LVES BIN SHORTHATDA WK AR
11646,THEY EAT LIKE ALL KINDS OF TRASH AND WHAT THEY RETURN IS THEY RETURN NUTRIENTS TO THE EARTH,THEY EAT  RASH IN R I  NW A TO THE EART
11647,THAT MEANS IT'S AN OMNIVORE,THAT MEANS AN ODR
11648,WHAT IS HAS TO BE IT'S KINDA LIKE UM UM KILLING OTHERS LIKE THIS BEAR IS EATING A FISH AND PROBABLY THE RED TAILED HAWK EATS LIKE RABBITS AND BIRDS,LAR HAS B UNING OTHERS LIKE LIKE THE EAS EATING ISH PER THE  RABD
11649,THERE'S HERBIVORE OMNIVORE CARNIVORE AND I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE LAST ONE IS,THEOODO OTHE LAST
11650,I THINK WHAT IT MEANS TO BE AN OMNIVORE LIKE HUMANS AND BLACK BEARS EAT MEAT AND PLANTS,I THINK MEANS TOBE UNLIKE HUMONS IN BLACBERSMT AN PLANTS
11651,THEY BREAK DOWN DECAYING AND DECAYING MATTER AND THEY TURN IT INTO SOIL,THE BRAK DON VACASION BECAME AERD TRTE SOYA
11652,THAT TELLS ME IT HAS TO RETURN SOMETHING TO THE EARTH BECAUSE THEY ATE SOMETHING THAT MEANS THAT UM THEY RETURNED NUTRIENTS TO THE EARTH,THAT MIAS  TURND SOMTHIN T BECAUSE MNS N THE TNEW JREAS TO THE EARTH
11653,IT IS A CONSUMER,CANUMOR
11654,THIS IS ALL ABOUT WHAT ANIMALS AND FUNGI AND BACTERIA EAT,TI ALL BOUT ANMLES FOM GIN ATERIO
11655,MEANS TO BE A CARNIVORE IS LIKE LIONS AND POLAR BEARS ONLY EAT MEAT THAT'S WHAT A CARNIVORE IS,TO BE A CAR LIKE YONTS MPBRS ONY THTS IS
11656,GOOD,GOOD
11657,THEY GO THROUGH THEIR OWN PHOTOSYFESIS TO MAKE THEIR OWN FOOD,THEY GO THRO THER USI
11658,WHAT MAKES A PLANT A PRODUCER IS BECAUSE IT MAKES IT'S OWN THROUGH PHOTOSYNFESIS UM FROM SUNSHINE AND WATER,DTMAKES PDUCERBECAS T S SAUM FROM SUN SHIN WATER
11659,IT ONLY EATS PLANTS THAT MEANS IT'S A HERBIVORE,IT NLY EATS PLANTS THAT MAS AERBFOR
11660,A PRODUCER MAKES IT'S OWN FOOD AND IT GETS SUNSHINE AND WATER TO MAKES IT'S OWN PHOTOSYNFESIS AND MAKES IT'S OWN FOOD,THE PRDUSCER MIKES WITH FUD A IT GET S SHY N WATER K UNE SION
11661,AND HERBIVORE MEANS LIKE LIKE ELK OR DEER OR BUNNIES ONLY EAT PLANT,IERB MNS IKE IK  HO  PLANTS
11662,THE BEAR IS AN OMNIVORE BECAUSE IT EATS MEAT AND PLANTS,THE BAR IS AN RBECAUS S MTS  PLANTS
11663,THEY GET IT FROM DECAYNAH AND DECAHNUH ORGAN ORGANIC MATTER,THEY CAERT FROM VACATO OORGANIC MATER
11664,GET THEIR ENERGY FROM EATING OTHER THEY CAN'T THEY CAN'T EAT THEMSELVES BECAUSE AND THEY CAN'T MAKE THEIR OWN FOOD SO THAT'S WHY THEY HAVE TO EAT THE OTHER ANIMALS AND THEY EAT PRODUCERS,THER ENRGEY FROM EATING THER A THEMSELVES BCATA CATMAKE THE ONTHATS WIY THA A  OTHER ANAMALES IN  PRDUCE S
11665,IT'S NOT A PRODUCER OR A CONSUMER IT'S A DECOMPOSER,SNTERUMRTHE COMPSER
11666,THEY EAT IT ALL AND THEN THEY TURN IT INTO SOIL THAT'S WHY THEY ARE A DECOMPOSER,TH EA ELEE T HE TRT SOTHAT W  COMPOSURE
11667,I THINK THAT PRODUCERS ARE THE GRASS AND THE PINECONE,I THINK THE PDUCERARE  GRAS IN THE PAN CA
11668,WHAT IT'S ALL ABOUT BECAUSE IT BREAKS DOWN HERE OR DIGGING UM ALL ORGANISTS OF MATTER,WH I ALLEBOUT BECAUSE THE IE O  T ORGANIMATER
11669,NO THEY ARE NOT,NO
11670,I THINK WHY IT'S SO IMPORTANT IS JUST BECAUSE UM THEY RETURN NUTRIENTS AND WE NUTRIENTS IN OUR BODY,I THINK WY I SO EMPART IS JUST BECAS THEVER TURN NEW AS IN NEW AS
11671,I THINK WHAT'S TO BE A CONSUMER IS UM TO UM EAT OTHER THINGS THEY'RE NOT THEY DON'T THEY CAN'T MAKE THEIR OWN FOOD THEY HAVE TO EAT OTHER THINGS TO GET THEIR ENERGY,I THINK N VA COSUMR THER TINKS SUR NOK HE OMDA A TO EA OTHER THINKST ER ENARGY
11672,WHEN THEY RETURN NUTRIENTS TO THE WORLD LIKE WE KINDA RETURN NUTRIENTS TO THE CAUSE WE NEED NUTRIENTS IN OUR BODY,WHEN THEY RTURN NEW JEIMS THE WE CAVER TR A TNEW AS
11673,I THINK WHAT IT MEANS TO BE A DECOMPOSER THAT IT MEANS IT EATS IT AND THEN IT UM RETURNS NUTRIENTS TO THE EARTH,I THINK MEANS T BAT THE COMPSERS TUTIRNS NEWE DRAMS TO THE EARTH
11674,BECAUSE THEY BREAK DOWN BONES AND ALSO THEY CAN TURN IT INTO SOMETHING NEW LIKE SOIL JUST LIKE WORMS,BECAUSE THE BRKE DOWN NS I S TH TR INSOMTHING LIKE OY UST  S
11675,THE DECOMPOSERS ARE MUSHROOM OR FUNGI AND BACTERIA,THE DECOMPOSERES ARE UY IN ATERIOD
11676,I BEEN LEARNING ABOUT THE FOOD WEB ALSO PRODUCERS DECOMPOSERS AND CONSUMERS,ENLBOUT THE W ALS URCOMPSERSIN UM
11677,IT'S A DECOMPOSER IT EATS DECAYING AND DECAYING MATTER AND RETURNS NUTRIENTS TO THE EARTH,ECOMPOSER  A A AERTURN NEW RAMS TO THE EARTH
11678,I THINK WHAT THE LUNGS DO IS THAT UM THEY GIVE US OXYGEN AND THE MAIN ORGAN FOR BREATHING IS IN HUMANS AND SO THAT'S WHAT I THINK ABOUT LUNG,I THINKE WT LOUNGS  S THEY GIVE A AON IN HMAN ORGAN FO BREATHING NHUMONSTHAT I THIK
11679,THEY UH BRING IN OXYGEN WITH EXCHANGE OF THE CARBON DIOXIDE,TE BR O WITH AXCHANGE OF THE CARDOSDE
11680,WHAT THE LUNGS DO IS THAT ONCE WE BREATHE IN IT GETS KIND OF FATTER AND BIGGER AND ONCE WE GO OUT IT GETS SMALLER,W LUG WOE IS THAT WEN W BRATH S ATERGERWEN W BRATHE S SALLER
11681,THAT UM IT'S GOING THROUGH AND THROUGH LIKE I SEE LIKE SOME CIRCULAR THINGS AND IT'S GOING BY FROM THE HEART AND THE CAPILLARY AND OTHERS,A I GOING THRO IN THRWO LIKE AIK SOME SIRCLLEAR THINGS  UMBFROM THE AHRS
11682,HOW THEY INHALE AND EXHALE IS INHALE IS LIKE ONCE YOU BREATHE IN FROM THE NOSE WHICH IS THE FILTER AND THEN EXHALE IS WHEN YOU BREATHE OUT,ATHE N    IN HL IS LIKE WEN SHOU BRATH FROM THE NAS ER AL WHN YOU BREATHED OUT
11683,I THINK WHAT IT'S ALL ABOUT IS THAT IT'S SHOWING HOW UM WHERE AIR GOES IN AND CARBON DIOXIDE GOES OUT IN AND OUT OF YOUR MOUTH OR YOUR NOSE,I THINK WSALLEBOUT IS SHOWING HO W AGOS A YOUR MOUTHON YOUR NOS
11684,WHAT THE RESPIRATORY SYSTEM DOES IS LIKE IT HELPS YOU BREATHE LIKE WHEN IT IT GOES IN AND OUT OF YOUR LUNGS WHEN OXYGEN GOES IN AND CARBON DIOXIDE GOES OUT,THE RATORI SISTOME DU IS LIKE  HELPO BRTHIKE WEN IT GOWS IN AN ELEVAT LMS WHEN AISION GOS
11685,I SEE LITTLE CIRCLES LIKE IT'S GETTING PASSED THROUGH LIKE A SYSTEM LIKE THE CARBON DIOXIDE IS GOING OUT AND OXYGEN IS GOING IN,I SEVE L CIRCS LE ING PAT THRW LE A TMLIKE A DIOSID  O NSN
11686,DOING GOOD,D
11687,THEY'RE RESPONSIBLE FOR I THINK WHEN CARBON OXYGEN GOES IN AND THEY'RE RESPONSIBLE FOR CARBON DIOXIDE TO GO OUT,HA RESPONBL FOR I THINK WHEN CON GOS HRESP MD
11688,WHAT THE EXCHANGE OF GASES IS ALL ABOUT IS WE SURVIVE WITH OXYGEN WE CAN'T SURVIVE WITH CARBON DIOXIDE CAUSE THAT'S KIND OF A POISON OXYGEN TO US,THE XCHANGE OF S W SEIRV WITH ONWE AN SIRVIVE WITH CARODIS TPSTUS
11689,FIRST OF ALL WE NEED TO SURVIVE SECOND OF ALL UM IT'S OUR ONLY WAY OF LIFE TO BREATHE,FUT OLWE  SIR SON ONLY WAVELIE TO BREATHE
11690,THAT WOULD PROBABLY BE OXYGEN,THAT WIULD PROBELY BE OCSOGION
11691,THE GAS EXCHANGE IS FROM THOSE ALVEOLI AND UM THAT'S WHERE UM WHERE THE OXYGEN GOES IN AND THE CARBON DIOXIDE GOES OUT,THASTIC CHANGE M IS FROM THE AVI THATS WH OAION GOWS I IN THE CARP D O
11692,I THINK IT IS E FOR LUNGS,I THINK S EAI FO LN
11693,I THINK THEIR BEHAVIOR IS SAFETY BECAUSE THEY DON'T WANT TO BE EATEN WHEN THEY ARE FLYING HIGH IN THE AIR,I THINK THEIR BEA E SAFTY BECASE LAAR
11694,I'M DOING GOOD,I'M DWINGOD
11695,THIS IS A NON LEARNED BEHAVIOR BECAUSE THEY'RE HATCHING FROM THEIR EGG AND THEY'RE THEY'RE ALREADY CRAWLING OUT TO SEA,THIS IS AN NE BEHAVIER BCS ACAMES FROM THE  TH ALL READY COLING OUTTE
11696,THE STIMULUS IS BECAUSE THE SKUNK OR THE COYOTE HAS AN ADAPTATION THE SKUNK HAS A,THTEMELIS IS BECASE THE UNTER THE CAYO AS ABCATION WIIS
11697,SO I THINK WHY SO IT COULD SWIM AND LIKE IT COULD LIKE IT COULD LIKE PUSH IT IN CASE IF LIKE ONE OF IT'S DUCKLINGS LIKE COMES FALLING BEHIND,SIR I THINK WYSOR T  WIM  LK A PUSH IN THCASUMS  BEHIND
11698,HE WOULD PROBABLY ATTACK FOR IT OR JUST RUN AWAY,HE WILL PROBA TAP FORT ON THA
11699,THAT THE RATTLESNAKE IS RATTLING IT'S TAIL TO SAY GO AWAY FROM ME OR ELSE I'LL BITE,THHATHER SNAKE IS WAWA FROM THE AT
11700,IT'S TELLING THE PERSON LIKE ONCE A SNAKE'S TAIL IT RATTLES THEN IT'S ABOUT TO ATTACK THE PERSON,TLNG PERSON LIKE ONNAKERA IS ABOUT TO ATACKT THE PERSON
11701,NO,WE
11702,LIKE THE REACTIONS OF PEOPLE AND ANIMALS,LIKE TH REACTIONS  PEOPLE IN ANMAL
11703,I THINK IT'S MIGRATE BEHAVIOR CAUSE THEY'RE LIKE NOT GETTING EATEN,I THINK  MY R BEHAVERCST
11704,THAT THEY WANTED TO PROTECT THEMSELVES FROM OTHER PREDATORS,THY TED TO PRTECT THEM SELVES FROM OTHER RESTORS
11705,LIKE THE FLIPPERS HELP EM KIND OF LIKE FEET TO SWIM AND ALSO THE BEAK FOR LIKE TO EAT LIKE FISH OR SOMETHING FOR LIKE ITS FOOD OR SOMETHING,THE FLA BIRS ELP CAD TO SWAME IN  THE AT LKE FISHIONTHING
11706,IT'S A NOT LEARNED BEHAVIOR,SHULD NOT LEARN BEHAVIEAR
11707,THAT IT COULD SHOOT A BAD SMELL OUT OF ITS TAIL,IT CAN SHUT THA BIGESMELLE OOTLE
11708,A CAT IS FALLING FROM A TREE,HE CAT IS FON FROM THE TREY
11709,IT'S PRETTY MUCH MARKING ITS TERRITORY SO PREDATORS CAN'T EAT IT AND ALSO HOW ONE WAY THEY COULD DEFEND THEMSELVES,PR MUCH MMTEROTOR MPATORES CEANW FEN THEM SALE
11710,I THINK IT'S A LEARNING BEHAVIOR BECAUSE YOU ARE LEARNING HOW TO WRITE YOUR NAME,I THINK  A LARING BEHAVER BECAUSE YOU AME
11711,THAT HE'S TELLING THE PERSON TO GO AWAY OR ELSE I'LL BITE YOU BECAUSE HE'S TRYING TO DEFEND HIMSELF FROM PREDATORS LIKE HUMANS,TELLING THE PERSON TO GO BECAUSE  TRY DOFEN HMOMMONS
11712,THAT THE SKUNKS TAIL IS ONE OF THE ADAPTATIONS BECAUSE IT SHOOTS THE SMELL OUT OF IT,B THE UM TA IS ONO THE EATION CASLL
11713,THAT THEY ALL HAVE DIFFERENT REACTIONS ON DIFFERENT THINGS,THELL A DIFRNT REACTIONS ON DIFRENT THINGS
11714,BECAUSE USUALLY ANIMALS ARE SCARED OF BRIGHT COLORS OR PREDATORS ARE SCARED OF BRIGHT COLORS,BECAUS Y ANMLES ARE SCARED OF IT ET SCARED OF IT CLLERE
11715,LIKE IT'S KIND OF LIKE THE SAME COLOR AS THE GROUND AND ALSO THE TURTLE CAN ACTUALLY HIDE IN ITS SHELL AND ALSO IT CAN COME IN SO NO PREDATORS CAN GET IT,THE SAME  ALSO THE R  ACTOLY HI  A IN SUMN AOET
11716,THAT MEANS WHAT THE REACTION PART IS I WOULD PROBABLY JUST GO AWAY FROM IT,THAT MNACTIO  ROBL W FOM
11717,I THINK IT'S A MIGRATION BEHAVIOR BECAUSE THE BLACK THING IS STUCK ON THE HUMAN'S KNEE,I THINK II ION O BEHAVERBECAUS THE BLAC THING IS TUCK OHUMON EA
11718,THAT LIKE THE DOG WANTS TO CATCH THE FRISBEE AND HE IS HAVING FUN AND ALSO THE BIRDS ARE FLYING TOGETHER SO THEY COULD BE SAFE,LK  DOG WN ACH TE THE BIRDSATHERSE
11719,IT'S INSTINCTIVE BECAUSE IT'S REACTING CAUSE IT'S FALLING AND HE WANTS TO LAND SAFELY ON THE GROUND,IT NSTINKTED BECAUSE  REACT H M SAFELY ON HGROUND
11720,I THINK IT'S KIND OF LIKE LIKE A MIGRATION BEHAVIOR,I THINK AT CAMY BEHAVER
11721,I THINK NUMBER TWO THE TEETH BECAUSE THAT'S HOW IT CHEWS THE MEAT,I THINK NUMBER O TETH BECASE ED E
11722,I THINK IT'S THE WINGS BECAUSE IT HELPS IT FLY AWAY FASTER FROM THE PREDATOR,I THINK S THE WINGS BECAUSE THPS L ASTER UM FROM THE RE
11723,I THINK IT'S SIX BECAUSE THE HOUSES THE LAND THE MOUNTAINS THE SKY THE TREES AND THAT LITTLE UM BLUE GREY BROWN THING,I THINK SIX BECAUSE THE HOUSE IS D  HE SY THE RE IN THAT MBLW GRARON THINKS
11724,I SEE THE WATER I SEE THE ATMOSPHERE WHICH IS THE SKY I SEE THE MOUNTAINS I SEE SOME TREES AND SOME HOUSES,WATERI  AMSFEAR THE SKI I  OME TRES IN SUME HOUSES
11725,I THINK THE BIOSPHERE IS MADE OUT OF UM PROBABLY TREES AND HUMANS AND ANIMALS PROBABLY JUST TREES PLANTS AND ANIMALS,I THINK THE VIOUES EARS MAD UPOB THS IN MMONDSPROBLY JOUST CEASE PLANS FOR ANMALESTHATS
11726,THE BIOSPHERE IS PROBABLY ALL ABOUT LIFE LIKE TREES PLANTS AND US LIKE HUMANS,THE BIOU  S POP ALL ABOU LIFE K TRES PLANTAN EARTH HMOND
11727,GOOD,
11728,I THINK THEY'RE JUST TRYING TO SURVIVE NOT LIKE TO GET EATEN BUT PROBABLY THE MOST DANGEROUS ONES ARE A SNAKE A RED TAILED HAWK,I THINK AE JUST TRYNG TO SIRVIVE OLPOBLY THE MOST DANGEROUS WONSAKE IN THE HAW
11729,WELL PROBABLY MOST ANIMALS GO FOR PROBABLY BACTERIA MUSHROOMS AND UM THE OTHERS JUST GO FOR LIKE PLANTS,POBLMOST AML O F ATERIOM MUSHROMSD O THE OTHER JUSTGO FOR IED PLANTS
11730,I THINK SOME YEAH,I THINK SOME A
11731,IT'S KINDA MOSTLY IN THE SAME THING BUT IT'S MOSTLY IN THE WINTER OR LIKE ANTARCTICA OR LIKE WHERE MOUNT EVEREST IS,CAUOSTLY THE SAME THING PUIS MOSTL IN THE WINTER LIKE AAVERIIS
11732,I THINK IT REPRESENTS THE CLIMATE OR WEATHER OR LIKE THE TEMPERATURE,ITHINK ITREPRESENTS THE LMATWEATHER LK A TEMPAURE
11733,WHAT IT NEEDS IS TO SURVIVE IS PROBABLY SOIL WATER AIR AND SUNSHINE,D T SIRVIVE I  WATER AIN HE SUNSHUD
11734,THEY DON'T GET THEIR OWN FOOD THEY MAKE THEIR OWN FOOD CAUSE THEY'RE A PRODUCER AND IT MAKES IT'S OWN FOOD THROUGH PHOTOSYNTHESIS,THEY DON'T GET THEO D TH MIKS TCAHEPDUSCERAMKS  OTE AIS
11735,THEY MAKE IT THROUGH THEIR OWN PHOTOSYNTHESIS,AMAIN THRO THER ONTO ESIS
11736,IT KIND OF LOOKS GREEN BUT IT IT HAS SUNSHINE AND AIR BUT NO WATER SO THAT'S WHY IT'S KIND OF LIKE BENDING,I ALOOK CREEN BMIT HAS SUNSHIN ARBT W WATERTH WTTHETHINKS
11737,I THINK ALL THOSE CELLS LIKE COMBINE TO MAKE ONE WHOLE LIKE TINY GRAIN OF SAND OF YEAST,I THINK ALL ESELLES  CONBIND MA TME RN SANTA E
11738,IT'S LIKE WHAT EATS WHAT AND WHAT EATS THEM,ALIKE WAA
11739,WHEN WATER SUNSHINE AND AIR AND LIKE ALL THOSE COMBINE TOGETHER THE ROOTS GO DOWN INTO THE DIRT AND THEN WHEN WHICH COMES OUT IS LIKE A PLANT,WATER SUN SH IN ALIKE ALOS CAN B TGTHTHE RUDO DOWN THE IRTTW CUM RE A PLATA
11740,IT'S KIND OF LIKE WHEN YOU GET LIKE A SUNBURN LIKE A HUMAN AND IT'S GETTING ALL YELLOW CAUSE IT HAS NO SUN AND IT'S NOT GETTING ANY GREEN,I WHENLIKE A SUDN BIR IKE A HUMON  TIG  YELLO BECAUS HAS NO S
11741,DOING GOOD,TWIN
11742,THEY DO NOT BECAUSE BECAUSE WHEN IT RAINS IN THE SPRING IT GETS WATER AND THEN SUNSHINE AND THEN IT GETS AIR WHEN IT BLOWS,THEA NOT BECA BECAUSE EN RINS IN THE SPRINGTS WATER SON SHI  WT FLOWS
11743,I THINK PLANTS I READ A BOOK ABOUT THIS AND IT PROBABLY NEEDS CARBON DIOXIDE WHICH IS KIND OF IT'S AIR,I THINK PLANTS  READ A BOOK BOT LEATS ARDI
11744,ACTUALLY NO BECAUSE WHEN I DID MY EXPERIMENT IN THE BAG WE DIDN'T USE ANY WATER AND IT'S AND IT'S STILL GROWING ON ITS OWN,ACTHOLY BECAS WEN MY AXPERMENT SUM N HE BAWTNT YUT Y WATER ST GROWING
11745,YES THEY DO NEED IT,SAATED
11746,YES IT DOES,ES
11747,IT'S BECAUSE THEY WERE ALL SICKLY AND NOT HEALTHY,BECAUSE THE IEY
11748,IT WOULDN'T BE A PROBLEM BECAUSE LIKE I JUST SAID IT GOES THROUGH IT'S OWN PHOTOSYNTHESIS WHICH IT MAKES IT'S OWN FOOD IT CAN'T EAT ANYTHING,IT AN BE  POME BECAS JUSTOS THR
11749,WHEN WE PUT THE PLANTS IN THE BAG IT HAD LIKE A TON OF AIR OR CARBON DIOXIDE IN IT AND THAT'S WHY IT NEEDS TO SURVIVE,WHEN WE PUT THE PLANTS IN THE BAIOSIDTHATS WY D SERVVE
11750,IT HAS TWO OUT OF THREE BUT NOT THREE OUT OF THREE BECAUSE THEY IT NEEDS WATER AIR AND SUNSHINE IT CAN NOT BE WATER AIR AND NO SUNSHINE,I HAS TWO LO THREE U THREE OO THREE BECASE INEATS WATERN SIT N WATER
11751,I THINK IT'S TRYING TO MAKE SOME KIND OF SIGNAL OR SOMETHING,I THINK TRY TO MAKE SOME CSGR
11752,BECAUSE IT CAN'T BREATHE ANY CARBON DIOXIDE AND IT'S NOT BREATHING OUT ANY OXYGEN,BECAUSE I ABRATHE ENAY CA DISIDE S NOT BRATING  OKSJION
11753,I THINK IT'S KIND OF LIKE PLANTS LIKE THEY NEED SUNSHINE AIR AND WATER,I THINK IT  PLANTS LIKE THE MEAT SUNSHINE ARIN WATER
11754,YES IT WOULD BE MISSING THREE THINGS SUN WATER AND AIR,GASON WILL BE MIINTHREE H WATER AIR
11755,HOW IT RELATES TO ME IS LIKE IT GOES THROUGH IT'S OWN PHOTOSYNTHESIS IT NEEDS SUNSHINE WATER AND AIR FOR IT TO GROW,ELET TME LIKE ALAGO EATS SUN SHINE WATER A ORT  GROW
11756,WHERE FOOD WEBS START WILL PROBABLY BE AT THE PRODUCERS BECAUSE PROBABLY MOST CONSUMERS EAT THOSE PRODUCERS,STARTE WILL POBL BET PDUCERS BECAUSE TMDUC
11757,THEY JUST STAY IN ONE PLACE THEY DON'T MOVE BESIDES THEY MAKE THEIR OWN FOOD THROUGH PHOTOSYNTHESIS WITH THE SUN CARBON DIOXIDE AND WATER,PLEASED THE DOT  THE MAER ROO THRO  WITHE UMCARBOD OSDE
11758,THINK WHAT IT'S TRYING TO SHOW IS THAT SUNSHINE REFLECTS OFF THE PLANT SO IT CAN,THINKWN IS TRYING TO SOW I THE SU RFLECT OTHE PAN
11759,BECAUSE GRASS AND THE PINE CONE ON THE TREE ARE PRODUCERS AND THE PLANTS ARE PRODUCERS THEY MAKE THEIR OWN FOOD WHICH THE CONSUMERS EAT,BECAUSE GRAS IN THE PAN ON THE TRE ARE PDUSARH IN THE PLANTS ARE PUCRWOEET
11760,YES THEY DO NEED IT BECAUSE IT'S KIND OF LIKE WHAT THEY NEED TO BREATHE,BEAUS IK ETHE
11761,WHAT I JUST REALLY THINK IS JUST WHAT EATS WHAT EATS THE PRODUCERS CONSUMERS AND THE DECOMPOSERS,WI I JUST REALLY THINK S USTEAS  PDUSER IN THE COMPSERE
11762,IT'S BECAUSE IT DOESN'T HAVE ANY WATER,BECAUS IT DOESN'T HAVE NEY  WATERR
11763,I THINK LIGHT WHEN IT REFLECTS SO IT HELPS IT GROW I THINK THE WATER WHEN YOU POUR IT SO IT STAYS HEALTHY AND THE CARBON DIOXIDE WHICH IT BREATHES IN AND OXYGEN IT BREATHES,I TINK L WENREFLECT FROMI THINK WERWHEN YOU P STAS L IN THE CARDIRET B A ATH
11764,I THINK THEY DO BECAUSE SOME ANIMALS EAT THEM AND THAT WILL PROTECT THEM FROM ANIMALS,I THINK  BECAS OME ANMALES EAT THEMTHAT WILL PRTECT THEM FROM ANMA
11765,I THINK WHY IS BECAUSE THERE'S NO WIND AND THERE'S JUST SUNSHINE AND WATER BUT IT HAS TO BE COMPLETE WITH WATER AIR AND SUNSHINE FOR IT TO GROW,I THINK BECAUSE THERS  N THER SUNSHIN  WATERIT HAS BE COMPLEAT WITH WATER  IN SOUME SHIN FOT GROW
11766,IT HAS WATER SUNSHINE BUT NO AIR,I HAS WATER SUNH
11767,THE SUN,LEA
11768,NO THEY DO NOT NEED FOOD BECAUSE THEY THEY HAVE THEY HAVE THEIR OWN PHOTOSYNTHESIS WHICH THEY MAKE THEIR OWN FOOD,THEY DO NOT EA BECASE THAY THA HAVE THEIR UN TED S WIH THY MAKE E
11769,LIKE SOME PEOPLE SAY SO IT DOESN'T DAMAGE IT,I SOME PEOLE SA IM O USN DAMAGES
11770,SOMETIMES WHEN CONSUMERS ARE EATING THEM THEY'LL HAVE TO PUT FERTILIZER AROUND IT SO THE ANIMALS CAN'T EAT CAUSE IF THEY EAT IT IT'LL KIND OF BE LIKE A GROSS TASTE,SUM TIMES WEN CUMORDS AREATING THEM WILL HAVE T ROUANMLS EACAUS THE ANBE LK AROAST
11771,IT SHOWS LIKE A LIKE A LIKE A SOME KIND OF OF DRINK THAT MAKES IT GROW FOOD,IT SHODES LIKE IE AI SOME IOE DRINK THAT MAKES A GROW
11772,IT'S BECAUSE THEY DO THEIR OWN PHOTOSYNTHESIS WHICH THEY MAKE THEIR OWN FOOD,BECAUSE TH DUR  E
11773,IT HAS ALL THREE THINGS WATER AIR AND SUNSHINE,WILL LHAS A THR HWATER A IN SUNSHD
11774,I THINK ANYTHING ELSE TO POINT OUT TO ME IS LIKE WHEN THE YEAST KIND OF LIKE RISES FROM THE BREAD EXCEPT IT GETS IT PUFFY FOR THE AIR OR CARBON DIOXIDE THAT FLOWS IN THE BAG,I THINK ING  POYOUT M WEN THE A S FROM THE  A POF OR THE AS O THE BET
11775,YES IT CAN BECAUSE IF IT DOESN'T HAVE ANY SUNSHINE IT WILL TURN LIKE FIRST DAY IT WILL TURN TAN THEN IT WILL TURN YELLOW NOT GREEN,YESIT CAN BE CAS IF IT DOUSN' HAVE NEY SUN SHI  TRN LIK TETHE TR YEO
11776,IT'S ALL HEALTHY AND BECAUSE IT HAS ALL THREE THINGS WATER AIR AND SUNSHINE,HEL NEW CR BECAUS IT HAS ARTH THNKS WATERSUNSHIN
11777,WHAT I OBSERVE IS LIKE LITTLE TINY PARTICLES INSIDE THE YEAST WHEN IT'S LIKE KIND OF LIKE MIXED WITH THE WATER,BEARDI LIKE L T ATACLES INSIDE THEETMIXT WITH THE WATER
11778,IT'S A HOUSE,
11779,WHAT'S IMPORTANT ABOUT PRODUCERS IS BECAUSE THEY MAKE THEIR OWN FOOD AND ONCE A CONSUMER COMES BECAUSE THEY CAN'T MAKE THEIR OWN FOOD THEY HAVE TO EAT SOMETHING THAT'S WHY THEY EAT THE PRODUCERS,PRBOUTDUCER  BECAS UDMAS BECAUS  MAK TH AO EAT SOMTING THPRDUCER
11780,THAT MEANS IT'S A ALL AND HEALTHY PLANT,THAT MNS NUTATED  HELY PLANS
11781,IT'S BECAUSE THEY NEED LIGHT ENERGY CARBON DIOXIDE AND WATER SO ALL THOSE THINGS SO IT CAN PRODUCE IT'S OWN FOOD WITHOUT THOSE THREE THINGS IT CAN NOT GROW,BECAUSE EEATH L RGEY CARM DI OUSIDE IN WATERIANDU   WIHOU THREE THINGS IT L NT GROW
11782,THERE IS ONE OF LIKE PARALLEL THERE IS THAT IS PALMATE AND THERE'S ONE THAT IS PARALLEL,T PEARTHERS ONE   T ONE  PAROE
11783,SOME EXAMPLES ARE SIMPLE LEAF PARALLEL LEAF AND PALMATE LEAF,SOUMEXZAMPLE A TMBLIEF PARELIEF AN ENT
11784,I THINK THE VEINS ARE FOR LIKE THEY ALSO USE LIKE THE BLOOD WHICH IT PUMPS IN KIND OF LIKE THE HUMAN BODY'S VEINS,I THINK THE VEAINS ARE O LIKE THEY ALSO US LIKE THE BLOD WUM IN CLICKE THE HOMON BODYVAS
11785,I'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT VEINS FROM LEAVES AND FROM SAP FROM TREES AND ALSO SOME OTHER STUFF FROM SCIENCE,I'VE BEN LEARIBOUT VAMS FROM LEFS OM FROM CTREN M OTHER AMP FROM SAANT
11786,ONE IS CALLED SIMPLE ANOTHER IS PALMATE AND THE THIRD ONE IS PARALLEL,ONE IS COLD SIMPLE OTHER MTTHRSONE  PARO
11787,I THINK IT COMES FROM THE AIR CAUSE KIND OF LIKE FROM THE CLOUDS IT GIVES LIKE WATER OUT ONCE IT RAINS SO I THINK THAT'S WHY,I THINK IT CUMS FROM THE ARS ARLG FROM THE LOIT GIVES  WATERANSOTNK
11788,IT IS THE PATTERN OF THEIR VEINS AND ALSO THE OUTSIDE SHAPE WHICH IT WAS BORN WITH,S THE PATER O THE VAIN ON OUTSTHE OUTSIDE SHAE  E WS BOR WITH
11789,THAT TELLS ME THAT IT IS A SIMPLE LEAF,THAT TELLES ME THI IS A  LIEF
11790,I THINK IT'S A SIMPLE LEAF BECAUSE IT'S KIND OF LIKE HALF AND HALF AND IT'S ALL PARALLEL AND IT'S KIND OF LIKE THE SAME ON HALF,I THINK IT A MLEFE BECAUSE  LIK AHA IN IT PEARRE THE SAME AF
11791,I THINK IT IS A SIMPLE LEAF BECAUSE IT'S VEINS ARE GOING KIND OF LIKE A CIRCULAR OUTSIDE DIRECTION,I THINK S STMLEH BECAUSE  VAINS AR GON K A SIRCLEARSIDE DIRECTION
11792,HOW IT GETS IT'S NUTRIENTS AND THAT'S GETTING OUT OF IT KIND OF LIKE THE CARBON DIOXIDE IT'S BREATHE I MEANT SORRY THE OXYGEN IT'S BREATHING OUT,WIL GET NEW CREIMS IN THE EXOM IM IOING
11793,I THINK IT WAS SOMEBODY THAT PUT A GUY A BAG AND POURED WATER IN IT OR MAYBE IT WAS JUST RAIN,I THINK  WS SOME BY ABIG IMFOR WATER IN TO JUST RA
11794,IT IS THE AIR AND WATER I SEE LIKE PARTICLES OF AIR AND PARTICLES OF WATER,ITS THE WATER I S LIKE ARTACLES IN PARTACLES OF WATER
11795,LIKE THE PHLOEM IS LIKE GOING DOWN IN THE PLANT LIKE IT'S NUTRIENTS AND PROBABLY THAT KIND OF LIKE THE OXYGEN THAT'S COMING OUT OF IT,THE VLUME IS KE GOING DOWN THE PLATNEW CRAM PROPLEXISION THE C TH ISION MAT
11796,I AM DOING GOOD TODAY,I'M NOT DEWING GOD TOAY
11797,THAT IT HAS LIKE DIFFERENT THINGS LIKE LIKE THE NUTRIENTS GO INSIDE AND THEN SOMETHING ELSE GOES OUTSIDE OF IT,ITAS K DIFRENT THINGS LIKE LIKE THE NEW CREAM GO INSI AN THEN SOME THING LOUSIDD IT
11798,THE ESOPHAGUS IT DOES THAT PUSHES ALL THE FOOD DOWN INTO THE STOMACH,THE SFTPUSH S LHE U DOWN INTO THE STUMIC
11799,MOUTH THE MOUTH USUALLY JUST CHEWS IT AND SWALLOWS IT,THE MOUTHS OUSLY JUST CHOS IN SWOLLOWSI
11800,OH IT IT PUSHES DOWN ALL THE CHEWED UP FOOD LIKE IT LIKE THOSE LITTLE BITS SO IT COULD LIKE FIT THROUGH THAT KIND OF LIKE LITTLE TUBE OF THE ESOPHAGUS,UN PUSHS DOWN AL THE U  LIKE A  BITS S  UNFIT TR THE  TOTA
11801,I SEE,ICE
11802,JUST TO USUALLY JUST TO BREAK DOWN THE FOOD AND ONCE YOU'RE HUNGRY YOU EAT SOME SO IT WON'T GO KIND OF LIKE HUNGRY FOR A LITTLE BIT,UST LY JUST UN DOTHE FD R NGER YOU EAT SUME SNGRY FORABIT
11803,I THINK WHAT'S FOR THE MUSCLE CELLS IS LIKE THEY HELP YOUR MUSCLES GROW OR SOMETHING OR I THINK THEY'LL HELP YOU MOVE IT,I THINK  FOR THE ML P OUR S  SOMTHING  THINK WLL HELP
11804,THEY ARE PROBABLY MADE OUT OF MEAT,THE AR PROBELY MAD   MEATS
11805,LIKE IN A DIGESTIVE SYSTEM IT HAS TO HAVE LIKE SOME KIND OF CELLS CAUSE MAYBE LIKE THE SALIVA THAT'S BEEN IN YOUR MOUTH ONCE YOU EAT IT MAYBE THOSE CELLS KIND OF LIKE BREAK IT DOWN,DIESTSTOM S OME CASB LK  ISPN YOUR MOUTHWEN OABE ADOWN
11806,THINK THE LEAF HAS LIKE A TON OF,TELIEF HAS I A T
11807,THERE ARE LIKE ALL SORTS OF CELLS AND MAYBE THEY CARRY THE NUTRIENTS FOR THE ARM SO THE SKIN'S HEALTHY,THE AR AL SORTS S ELES  MA BE T CAI THE NEW CR FO HE AM
11808,DOING GOOD,DWINGOD
11809,THEY USUALLY JUST BREAK DOWN THE FOOD WHICH YOU EAT WHEN YOU'RE HUNGRY,AOUR SL UST A DOWN H
11810,I THINK WHAT THEY ARE IS LIKE SOME KIND OF LIKE NUTRIENTS THAT HELP THE SKIN LIKE STAY LIKE HEALTHY AND STAYS SMOOTH,I THINK WIT THE AR IS LIKE OM SOME NEW TR NELLIKE TALKE ELH N S OTH
11811,IT'S TRYING TO SHOW ME THOSE BRAIN CELLS,TRY TO SHOW ME THOS AN ELLES
11812,WHAT THE MOUTH DOES IS ONCE YOU CHEW IT GOES DOWN INTO YOUR BODY INTO THE STOMACH,PUT THE MOUTH USWEN WENO SHO T GOS OWN INT YOUR BODY THE STUMIC
11813,WHAT I NOTICE ABOUT IT IS A HUMAN BODY AND I THINK IT'S POINTING TO CERTAIN THINGS WHERE THE CELLS ARE FOR MOST IMPORTANT STUFF,NOTS BOUTA HUMON BODYI THINK I GUMSIRCION THINGS WIR SELES AR FO MOST PO
11814,I THINK THE BUTTERFLY HAS CELLS BECAUSE IT NEEDS SOME KIND IF THING LIKE IT LIKE SUCKS UP POLLEN,I THINK THE BUTRFLAYE HAS O BECAS ITEATS SOME CIND OF THING L LIKE S AD
11815,WHAT IT TELLS ME IS LIKE THERE'S LIKE HUGE CELLS AND LIKE THERE'S LESS CELLS IN A LEAF BECAUSE THEIR ALL ALL THE CELLS ARE IN ONE SECTION,GUTELS ME  IRK H EHER LE SELLILEF BECASALLELES AR IN ONE SETOUN
11816,I SEE ALL SORTS OF CELLS AND I SEE SOME VEINS PLUS I SEE THE SKIN,I SE ALL SORTO ELLES WNI  OME VPUSN
11817,IT USUALLY JUST USUALLY JUST PUSHES IT DOWN INTO THE STOMACH THAT'S PROBABLY WHICH I ALL KNOW,EALY JUST LY UST PUSHIT DOWNTHE SB
11818,THEY ARE THEY ARE ALL SORTS OF CELLS,THY ARALL SORTS OF SELLS
11819,THEY BOTH DRINK,THE BATHDA
11820,LIKE IT'S KIND OF LIKE ALL IN THE DIGESTIVE SYSTEM LIKE ALL OVER YOUR BODY LIKE SOMEHOW IT COULD LIKE BREAKS IT DOWN OR HAS A CERTAIN JOB TO DO FOR THE WHOLE BODY,CAI ALEIN THE SK ALL OVER YOUR BO SOM HOW DOWNOR AS A SIR BTHE BODY
11821,I NOTICE THAT WHAT THIS IS SIMILAR TO THEM THAT THEY HAVE CELLS,I NOTEST W SIMALAR TO THEM TH
11822,I THINK WHAT IT'S TRYING TO SHOW US IS LIKE ONCE YOU EAT IT WHERE IT GOES THROUGH AND HOW LIKE THE STEPS WHERE IT GOES THROUGH TO BREAK DOWN ALL THE FOOD AND THEN YOU PEE IT OUT,I THINK CTRY TO SHO US S K WEN  EATWE GO TROTEPI DOWN ALL INTHE W POTO
11823,I SEE LIKE SHAPES KIND OF LIKE A AND MAYBE THERE WILL BE ALL SORTS OF CELLS KIND OF LIKE A TO TELL LIKE MESSAGES TO THE BODY,I S LIKE SHAPES CUING LIKE A SPARTHEIR BE ORLIKE MIE MESGES TO THE DY
11824,I THINK WHAT THE MUSCLE CELLS ARE LIKE THEY HELP YOUR MUSCLES MOVE,I THINK WTLES AR LIKE  HELPO M
11825,I THINK THEY ARE BECAUSE THEY BOTH HAVE BLOOD INSIDE OF EACH OTHER,I THINK THE AR BECAUSE THE BOTH A L INSID OF ECHOTHER
11826,I THINK THIS WAS TRYING TO SHOW IS KIND OF LIKE THE YEAST IS KIND OF LIKE THE SKIN OF A HUMAN BODY,I THIKTRYN TO SHOW H CAT E UMON BODY
11827,BUT I ALSO KNOW IS JUST TRAVELS ALL ALONG WITH THOSE CELLS LIKE WITH THE FOOD HOW LIKE SIDE BY SIDE OR LIKE IN A LINE OR SOMETHING,ALL SOE NO JUST TRAV ALLALONGI WITH SIDE BI SIDE ONDERSOMEHING
11828,THAT IT HAS ALL CELLS BECAUSE IT'S A LIVING ORGANISM,THATAS ALL SEL BECAS ORGANIOME
11829,I THINK WHAT THOSE BRAIN CELLS LIKE THEY LIKE SEND MESSAGES TO THE BODY LIKE LIKE TELL THE HAND TO MOVE,I THINK T S BA S LIE LIES SAME MESOGERES TO THE BOYLIKE AND
11830,IT'S THE GASTRIC JUICE IN THE ACID,IS S GESTI JUISE IN THE AD
11831,THE SKIN CELLS ARE FOR LIKE YOUR SKIN SO THEY STAY HEALTHY,THE SN ALL AR LST
11832,I THINK THEY'RE BOTH DIFFERENT CELLS BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT WORKING FOR LIKE LIKE YEAST CELLS ARE NOT WORKING FOR HUMAN CELLS,I ITHEIR B DIFERD SELLBECAS WRING OM SELLES ARE NOT WARING FO HUMON SALLES
11833,I'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT THE DIGESTIVE SYSTEM AND ALSO I'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT LIKE HOW IT WORKS THROUGH YOUR BODY,IVE BE LARING ABOUT THE ITUMIN SLARING   AMTS  OUR BDY
11834,IT WAS IMPORTANT BECAUSE THEY HAVE TO BE GOOD IN HAVE TO PUT IN GOOD AND IF IF THEY'RE NOT WELL DONE THEY CAN BREAK,IS IMPORTON BECAUSE I HAVE T ATODFTHER WLTAKE
11835,I THINK WHAT I WOULD LIKE TO TEST IS SEEING SEEING HOW FAR IT GOES AND SEEING THE LI THE BLOCK CAN GO BE HEAVIER,I THINK R WLD LIKE TO CAT  NG COWES SNG THE BEHAVIER
11836,I THINK IT'S,
11837,WE HAVE SEEN A FLIPPER SYSTEM,WEVSITN
11838,GOOD BYE,BYE
11839,YOU NEED A SOMETHING TO MAKE IT FLIP YOU NEED YOU NEED A STICK AND TO MEASURE IT,YOU M SOMTHING TO MAK  ITEATHEYOU NEAA STICKE IN O TERMNTS
11840,I THINK YOU WOULD JUST BY UM FOR EXAMPLE YOU CAN SAY THE BROOK HOLDS THE STICK IN AND IT MAKES IT AND YOU MEASURE IT AND IT MAKES IT GO IN,I THINK HE WILL JUST SCRPE B UN FORGZAMPL YOU CAN STHE BD HE STICKIN AND MAKE THE NGR MASERMECXCO
11841,IT MAKES IT A SYSTEM BECAUSE THE PROPELLER'S SPINNING AROUND,TMAKS TISTBECAUS THE PELERIS INGOUND
11842,I THINK WE HAVEN'T,WHAD
11843,WE HAVE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT FLIPPERS AND WE HAVE BEEN YEAH WE HAVE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT FLIPPERS,WE A ARING BOT S WE HAD AAE
11844,I THINK WHAT YOU CAN CHANGE YOU CAN,WE' ILEVY LOK TO SEIGOWS FIRTHER
11845,I THINK WHAT THAT IS ALL ABOUT IS MEASURING IT AND SEEING HOW FAR IT GOES,I THINK A ALLBOSG HO CRT GOWS
11846,I THINK WHAT'S GOING ON THERE IT MAKES A GOOD FLIPPER SYSTEM BECAUSE IT BOUNCES OFF AND IT HOLDS IT TIGHT AND YOU DON'T WANT TO BOUNCE IT OFF THAT HIGH BECAUSE THE THE STICK CAN BREAK,I THINK  GOWING ON THEBECAUSEOLDS IT TIT BOOPHUSE
11847,I'M VERY GOOD,VERYOOD
11848,YOU CAN ALSO UM DO A SMALLER STICK AND SEE YEAH YOU CAN DO THAT TOO,YOU CAN  SMAER TICK AN TO STHT
11849,WHEN YOU CLICK IT IT BOUNCES OFF,HEN YOU A AUC
11850,THESE ARE ALL ABOUT MEASURING HOW FAR THE BROOK GOES AND SEEING IF IT GOES THAT FAR,THSE OBECTS  ALL BOUT MSRTHBGOWS SNG
11851,I FOUND OUT THAT YOU GET YOU'RE MEASURING IT AND THAT YOU'RE SEEING HOW FAR THE BROOK GOES AND IF IT DOESN'T GO THAT FAR YOU PUT THE CAPACITY YOU WRITE THE CAPACITY AND YOU,OUN MASRN IGHCAPAT
11852,UM YOU CAN FLIP,YOU CAN DTHIS XPMNT
11853,UM YOU CAN THINK OF,YOU CAN THINK
11854,I THINK WHAT THE BASE IS ALL ABOUT IS MEASURING IT AND LIKE SEEING IF IT GOES FAR,THINK W BAE GAR
11855,I THINK WHAT IS UP WITH THAT OBJECT WOULD BE UM SEEING HOW FAR IT GOES MAYBE,I THINK WUT IS OPWIE OBTRACTM SING HO E B
11856,UM YOU CAN THE BLOCK THAT HOLDS THE STICK IT CAN BE SMALLER OR IT CAN BE HEAVIER,YOU CAN O THAT HOLD  STICK IT C BE SOLERA BE HEVYER
11857,THERE IS SOMETHING ON THE ON TOP OF IT AND THAT YOU HOLD IT YOU PUT IT UNDER THE BLOCK AND YOU JUST FLIP IT AND YOU SEE HOW FAR IT GOES,THE  HING PATL OUPUTT OUN ER O OU JUST SL  YOU SE FI
11858,IT CONNECTS IT BY PUTTING THE STICK ON THE BOTTOM OF THE BRICK AND IF IT GOES FAR YOU JUST PUSH IT IN YOU JUST TAKE IT OUT AND IT'S AND THEN JUST PUT IT,CONETT Y PUTING THE STICK ON THE BATUM THE  LRSAUS
11859,SPINNING THE RUBBERBAND AROUND AND SEEING HOW HOW FAR IT GOES,I THIN EAS ALL EBOUTS
11860,SYSTEMS ARE ALL ABOUT MEASURING AND DOING SEEING SEEING WHAT HOW THE SYSTEM LOOKS,I SOMS A OLL ABOUT M ZERNSNIH TOMLOOKE
11861,WHAT'S GOING ON WITH THAT IS THAT WE HAVE TO LEARN ABOUT PENDULUMS WE HAVE TO LEARN HOW TO P HOW TO DO SCIENCE AND AND TO LEARN MORE THINGS,BAYING ONWITWE HAFE TO LIRN ABOUT WE HA TO LHHO DO D SIINS N TO LIRN I THINKS
11862,NO SOME OF THEM HOLD TEN OR NINE,SOMETHEMHOL TEN OR NI
11863,VERY WELL,VERYWALL
11864,YOU CAN BUILD THEM OUT OF LIFEBOATS YOU CAN BUILD THEM OUT OF WOOD,YOU CAN BELD A LIVE BS YOU CAN BLL TH T
11865,LEARN ABOUT O,
11866,I I THINK I'M NOT SURE I THINK YOU HAVE TO MEASURE THIRTY CENTIMETERS ON THEM AND WE LEARNED HOW TO HOW MANY PENDULUMS THAT IT CAN HOLD AND HOW MUCH WATER IT CAN HOLD,I THINK IM NOUT SHORT I THINK AASD THIRTY SEVEN TOMTWE LRAV HA MY PAIT CAN HOLD ATERANHOLD
11867,ABOUT ELEVEN AND C COULD HAVE TEN AND THE SHORTEST ONE COULD HAVE EIGHT,LEVEN ISWEE COD HAVE TEN INTHE SIRT  HAVE EIGHT
11868,I THINK IT COULD CONNECT TO THE CAPACITY OF THE BOAT WOULD BE WE CAN JUST MEASURE MEASURE EM AND IT CAN BE EIGHTY MILLIMETERS OR SIXTY TWO MILLIMETERS THIRTY EIGHT FIFTY FIVE MILLIMETERS,NT THE COPAT  THE  IANBE LEMATO SIXTWO LEMATORS THRT EIGHT FIFTY FIVE ADO
11869,BYE,
11870,I'VE BUILT MINE OUT OF PA OUT OF PAPER CUPS,I BILLT INES  ASTOTHE PAPER CES
11871,FIRST YOU HAVE TO MEASURE A THE BOAT AND SEE AND PUT IT IN THE WATER AND YOU I THINK YOU MEASURE THIRTY CENTIMETERS ON THEM AND THEN YOU'D NEED TO,HFRST YOU HAVE TO A M PUT IT IN THE WATER  TINK OUASOED THRTY SEVEN TOMATOES  ME O
11872,WHY I THINK THEY GOT A DIFFERENT NUMBER OF PENNIES IS BECAUSE THEY CUTTED THEM SHORTER OR LONGER,W I THINK TACARD O NMBERISHBECAUSE THE AS
11873,I WOULD THINK ABOUT PUTTING PENNIES IN IT OR WATER,THINK ABOUT PUTING NES IN WATER
11874,I DISCOVERED THAT THE BOAT CAN FIT TWELVE TWELVE PENDULUMS IN THE LITTLE BOAT,I'E DISCAVERE THE BT CAFIT TWELE ANOMES IN THE LAERL BOOK
11875,WHEN I WHEN I NOTICED THAT A WASN'T DROWNING THAT MUCH I STARTED PUTTING MORE AND MORE UH PENDULUMS IN EM AND WHEN I DROWNED IT I I GOT MY ANSWER REALLY EASILY,WHEN I NOTESD THA EZON N  MUCH I STARTED ASAEDAUGHT MY ANS
11876,WE HAVE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT BOATS AND WE HAVE BEEN PUTTING PENDULUMS IN THE BOATS AND SEEING HOW MANY PENDULUMS CAN FIT INSIDE THE LITTLE BOAT,W V B LEARING BOT BOTSW  ING UMS IN THE BTSING HO MANY TEMS IINSIDE THELAER
11877,WE,
11878,THE LIFEBOATS ARE ALL ABOUT YOU GO YOU CAN GO ON A ROMANTIC DATE YOU CAN,GO TOTHE RAVER GET ON THE YOU CAN HAVE A PIICK IN THEM
11879,WHAT IS GOING ON THERE IS THE PROPELLER IS THE STRING IS MAKING IT BALANCE IT AND IT KEEPS GOING AROUND AND AROUND PROPELLER KEEPS GOING AROUND AND AROUND,WGOING ON THES  THE ING MAING ALSAP PERPLOWINAD
11880,I THINK IT WILL BECAUSE IT HAS TO HAVE MORE POWER ON IT AND IT HAS TO GO UP FARTHER AND I THINK THAT WOULD AFFECT IT,I THINK IT WILL BECAS  HAS HAE  POFARTHER
11881,SO IT HAS ALSO BEEN NICE TALKING TO YOU MARTY,SRIT HAS ALSVEN NICE
11882,WHAT WE'VE BEEN DOING IN SCIENCE WE WERE WE HAVE BEEN DOING AIRPLANES WE HAVE BEEN SEEING IS THE AIRPLANE PROPELLER CAN FLY,REN WING INSIA B AILSEING TH AIRPLAING PURPLER
11883,THANK YOU,THANKEE
11884,THANK YOU,YANKEE
11885,I THINK WHEN SETTING UP YOUR MY EXPERIMENT WAS IT WAS TRICKY TO PUT IT TOGETHER BUT IT WORKED REALLY WELL AND,I THINK WN AING MY EXPERMENT WASPUTTO OTHER RELY WAL
11886,IT'S GOING VERY WELL MARTY,WVERYWELD
11887,YOU CAN ALSO CHANGE THE PROPELLER YOU CAN USE FISHING YOU CAN USE FISHING WIRE AND YOU CAN MAKE THE PROPELLER SMALLER YOU CAN MAKE THE THE,W
11888,YOU,
11889,OKAY SO HOW MANY SPINS IT TAKES SPINS ARE FORTY FIVE SPINS IT MADE AND THE DISTANCE IS HOW MUCH METER HOW MUCH METERS YOU MEASURE IT,MSPOONSFORTY FIVE A STO MCHMAT
11890,SO WHAT THE PARTS OF THE PLANE I USE THE PROPELLER IS MAKING IT SPIN AND THE STRING THE STRAW AND THE STRING IS MAKING IT BALANCE IT,S WIPERSON PLAYING ARE YTHE PELER  MAINGSTHTH TRING IS MAKING A LAKTE
11891,I THINK THE KINDS OF THINGS THAT ARE IMPORTANT WHAT MAKES IF FLY IS THE PROPELLER MAKES IT FLY AND THAT THE STRING IS BALANCED AND A AND THAT THE STRAW IS GREAT IS PUT GOOD ON IT,I THINK CINDS OF THINGS WNL ASR L  STING WITH ALNT   A
11892,I THINK WHAT THAT IS ALL ABOUT IT MAKES THE PROPELLER SPIN AND IF WE DON'T HAVE THE RUBBER BAND IN THE BOTTOM IT'S NOT GOING TO WORK,I THINK T T I ALLO MAKES THE PER SPNYO ON'T HAVE A HE BATER
11893,YOU HAVE TO THE PROPELLER IS ALL ABOUT MAKING THE PROPELLER SPIN,A T THE PEER S ALL ABOUT MAKING THE RPER SPOS
11894,WHEN IT SPINS THE THING ON THE BOTTOM SPINS AROUND TOO WITH IT AND M AND THEN YOU MEASURE HOW MUCH FAR IT WENT,THE IN ON THE BOTEM SPIONS AROWND TWITEN OU MATERED HAL MUCH FOREONT
11895,I THINK THE NUMBER OF SWINGS ISN'T RIGHT BECAUSE YOU HA ALSO THE STRING HAS TO BE BALANCED AND THE PROPELLER HAS TO BE MOVING,I THINK THE BERSWAING  ST BECAUSE O D A REAMG HAS TO B ALON  THE PPETER HAS TOB
11896,WITH STRING,
11897,THANK YOU,
11898,MARNIE,R
11899,I THINK WHAT IS IMPORTANT ABOUT THE FLYING LINE IS BECAUSE AND IT ATTACHES TO IT AND IT MAKES IT BALANCE AND IF E YOU DON'T HAVE IT ON THE BOTTOM IT'S GONNA NOT GO THAT FAST,I THINK A IS OMPARON ABOUT THE FLYIN BECAS ASHIS TOATKS ONDON'T HAVE  ON THE BTMNGO FAST
11900,OKAY,
11901,WHAT YOU CAN ALSO DO WHEN THE PARTS ARE ALL WORKING TOGETHER IS YOU CAN PUT THE STRING INTO THE STRAW AND THEN YOU CAN JUST SWING IT ACROSS AND IT BALANCE IT AND IF IT DOESN'T BALANCE IT'S GOING TO WIGGLE A LOT,YOU CSDOM LVAGATHERO THE STRING INERTHEN YOU C WINGA OU DUS BALUT
11902,OKAY,Y
11903,I THINK THAT IF THE STRING ISN'T BALANCED THAT WELL IT'S NOT GONNA WORK IT'S NOT GONNA SPIN IT'S IT'S IT'S JUST NOT GONNA WORK,I THINK THIE THE CIRCIS IN ALSWIT PON
11904,YEAH THAT'S IT,PLER AI T OUR I TW JUST STAP THE TWTHERTHEM
11905,I AM VERY WELL HOW ARE YOU MARNIE,UMOR
11906,I THINK THE OTHER THINGS THAT ARE IMPORTANT WHEN YOU ARE FLYING YOUR PLANE IS THAT IT'S REALLY BALANCED AND IT'S NOT WIGGLING A LOT AND THAT YOUR PROPELLER SPINS,I THINK OTHER THINS WOIS A RALLY BABCLNG OIN OUPPSPONS
11907,I THINK THE PROPELLERS ARE ALL ABOUT I AM GUESSING THAT THE PROPELLERS ARE TO KEEP IT BALANCED,I THINK PETOS AR ALLNG OSBALONT
11908,ME TOO,ME
11909,UM WELL MAYBE IT'S YOU HAVE TO PUT THE AIRPLANE HANGING ATTACHED TO A STRING AND YOU HAVE TO SEE HOW IF IT CAN FLY,MABEJOO PUT THE AIRPLANE AN AUCH T
11910,BYE IT'S BEEN NICE TALKING TO YOU TOO,A NICE TO
11911,I THINK HOW I MIGHT AFFECT IT IS BECAUSE THE SECOND ONE ISN'T REALLY WELL DONE AND IF IT GOES UP IT'S GONNA GO BACK DOWN AND THE FIRST ONE IS GONNA KEEP GOING STRAIGHT,I TINK I TD BECAUS NIREALLY WBATHETSTT
11912,I THINK IT'S BALANCING IT AND IT'S MAKING THE AIRPLANE FLY,I THINK ALUM SING INMAKING THE AIRPLANE LAG
11913,THANK YOU,N
11914,THE STRING WAS ALL ABOUT SEEING HOW FAST THE AIRPLANE COULD H FLY AND THE STRING,THE PRING WAS LLEBOTAON THE SRING
11915,I THINK WHAT THAT WAS ALL ABOUT WAS,I THINK  THAT WAS ALL ABOUT
11916,IT CAN STAY A MAGNET AS UM FOR A BIT LONGER THAN IT CAN STICK TO THE MAGNET BUT IT LOSES ITS MAGNETISM,IT CAN SANAF LONGER TSTCK ITLS  SAM
11917,THE MAGNET RUBBING THE NAIL WILL GIVE SOME MAGNETISM TO THE NAIL SO IT CAN PICK UP THE PAPER CLIP,RUBTHE SOME MAGNATIOMN THE ALETHE ER
11918,THEY CAN GO THROUGH THIN OBJECTS AND ALSO THEY CAN CONNECT TO EACH OTHER WHEN THEY'RE OFF BUT THE MAGNETISM IS SO STRONG BETWEEN THE TWO MAGNETS THAT IT CAN PULL THROUGH THE TABLE,THE CAN GO T  OBJECTAS ONOT ETHER WL SOROUNG BETWEEN THE TWO MATS TI CAN PLL TRO THE TABEL
11919,THIS MAGNET THAT WE'RE SHOWING HERE HAS BEEN CONNECTED CAUSE THE PAPER IS VERY THIN,THI THSHAS BIN CONECTED CAUS THE PAPER IS VERY OON
11920,THE MAGNET CA IS LIFTING UP THE NAIL THAT IS SENDING ELECTRONS TO THE TO THE PAPER CLIP,THE AB IS LIFTING UPTHE NEL DM ATO TO THE RT LIF
11921,IF YOU DO NOT HAVE THE STRONGEST MAGNETISM IN YOUR MAGNET IT CANNOT GET THROUGH THICKER THINGS,F YOU DIN'NOT HAVE  IZOME IN YOUR CNT THR INS
11922,NAIL PICKED UP THE NAIL PICKED UP THE PAPER CLIP BUT THEN IT LOST ITS MAGNETISM AND THEN AND THEN THE MAGNET CAME BACK TO GIVE IT MORE MAGNETISM AND IT COULD PICK UP THE PAPER CLIP AGAIN,THE MABLE PICKED UP THE PAPER WASHED IT MAOTSOMETM TOR TSOMTHE ER
11923,A NAIL HAS SOME MAGNETISM IN IT TO PICK UP THE UM THE PAPER CLIP,MABEL HAS AT A MT TO PICK UP THE THE ER
11924,THE NAIL CAN ONLY S UM STAY LIKE A MAGNET SO LONG BECAUSE CAUSE IT DOES NOT IT CANNOT KEEP AS A MAGNET CAN THE MAGNETISM THAT STAYS IN IT FOREVER,THE MALE CANOLY SALKE AMANIT SO LONG BECAS CASCNOT CEPE AS IT THE FAMENT OSTAINT FOR EVER
11925,THE NAIL IS USING MAGNETISM TO UM KEEP THE PAPER CLIP ON IT BUT THE PAPER CLIP CAN ONLY STAY ON SO LONG CAUSE THE MAGNETISM UM WEARS OFF AFTER A WHILE,EASING ATISOME TH PAPER IFTHE PAPER CLIF CAN ONLY STAND SO LONG A THMWASOTERE
11926,WELL MAGNETS CAN STICK TO EACH OTHER BECAUSE THEY BOTH HAVE IRON AND THEY CAN ATTRACT BECAUSE THEY'RE ON DIFFERENT SIDES,FICK TO EACHOTHER BECAS THE BS HAVE IRCN ATRACT AS SIDES
11927,THE NAIL CANNOT ALWAYS BE A MAGNET AND THE MAGNET IS ALWAYS A MAGNET,THE EABLE COUN NOT ALWAYS BE A AWAS MADD
11928,THE NAIL IS NOT A MAGNET SO IT CAN'T PICK UP THE PAPER CLIP WHEN IT'S NOT CONNECTED TO THE MAGNET,THE MABL IS NOT AA SORI  THE PAPEROT CONECTED WITH A
11929,MAGNETISM IS WHEN UM THE MAGNET CAN STICK TO THINGS WITH IRON IN THEM,ATMFANIT C STICK TTHINGS WITH IRN AM
11930,IT IS PICKING UP SOMETHING WITH IRON IT JUST LIKE THE THE MAGNET IS DOING TO THE NAIL,PING PSMING WITH IRJUSK THE AENT D THE NALE
11931,THE NAIL IS ACTING JUST LIKE IT CAN BE IN ITS OWN MAGNET BECAUSE IT IS USING THE MAGNET'S FORCE,THE MAL ING JUST LIKE IT BE IN IS  ATBECAS  YUSIG TFOR
11932,WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT MAGNETS,WE'VE BEN LAING AOT AMENT
11933,I HAVE PUT IT THROUGH PAPER IT HAS GONE THROUGH SOME THIN TABLES AND ALSO IT STICKS TO ALL IRON,HPAPER S GON THROU SOME TEVN TABELE  ALLSO ETSTICKS RN
11934,MAGNETS GOING THROUGH THINGS CAN ONLY GO THROUGH CERTAIN THINGS CAUSE THEY'RE NOT AS THICK AS OTHER THINGS,MAB GOINRO THINGS CAN ONLY G TCIRT THINGS CK OTHER THANGS
11935,THE PAPER CLIP CAN STAY ON THE UM ON THE NAIL FOR MANY TIMES AND FALLS WHEN THE MAGNET HAS NO MORE MAGNETISM IN IT IN IT,THE PAPER CLIF CAN STA TEL FORMY TIMES T WHEN THE AAT HAS NOBL ETES T
11936,THE MAGNETS BOTH HAVE IRON IN THEM AND THEY'RE ON THE R THE DIFFERENT SIDES SO THEY ARE STILL ATTRACTING,HBS HAVE IR IN TEM THE DFRENT SIGES V TLOBTRACTD
11937,THE MAGNETS ON THE SAME TIME AND THE TABLE THI IS NOT THAT THIN I MEAN IT'S NOT THAT THICK SO IT MUS THEY MUST HAVE BEEN PULLING EACH OTHER BECAUSE MAGNETISM,A T  N THE SAME TIME TH ABEL  ACHATHER BECAS TISOMNE
11938,THE PAPER CLIP IS DROPPING OFF THE NAIL BECAUSE THE MAGNETIN MAGNETIS MAGNETISM BECAUSE OF MANY THINGS,THE BBR S OPNG UP THE ALE BECAS T T S T BECAS OE MNEY THINGS
11939,BYE,FIVE
11940,I KNOW THAT MAGNETS STICK TO IRON,I NO TH TC T IRN
11941,IF YOU RUB THE MAGNET ON THE NAIL IT'LL COLLECT ENOUGH FORCE SO THAT IT CAN PICK UP THE PAPER CLIP,FYOU RUG THE MAT ON THE NAALE ORSO THETPIC UP THE
11942,IF THE MAGNET TOUCHES THE NAIL THEN THEN IT CAN COME UP AND CREATE ITS OWN MAGNETISM,THF TUCH THE NALE IT AN CAUMUP ARA IS ONITISOME
11943,MAGNET DOESN'T HAVE ENOUGH FORCE PICK UP THE PAPER CLIP SO THE PAPER CLIP FELL ON THE FLOOR INSTEAD OF GOING THROUGH LIKE THE THIN PIECE OF PAPER AND CONNECTING TO THE MAGNET,OESNT HAVEHE FLOURISTED O OING THRO IKE  VN PSES OF PAPER  CONT THN
11944,THE NAIL IS ACTING LIKE A MAGNET BECAUSE THE MAGNET CAN PICK UP PAPER CLIPS TOO BECAUSE THEY HAVE IRON IN THEM,THE MABL IS ACTING LIKE A MITES HT BAS THAVE IRTEM
11945,THE MAGNETISM GOES THROUGH THE NAIL AND GOES INTO THE PAPER CLIP SO THAT THE NAIL CAN HOLD THE PAPER CLIP UP,THE MTIOME GOWS THRO THE MEROE AND GOWS IN THE PAPERLSTT CAN HOLD THE PAPERIFUP
11946,I'M GOOD VERY GOOD,I'M ERYGOOD
11947,IT HAS USED SOME OF THE MAGNETISM FROM THE MAGNET TO PICK UP THE PAPER CLIP ON ITS OWN,AS ED SOME MAITISOME FROM THE MTPICKPTHEER
11948,IT'S A PARALLEL CIRCUIT THAT MEANS THAT UM WIRES NEVER TOUCH,IS A PW SIRCUSTHATMEANS TH HEBIOS NEVER TUCH
11949,THANKS,THANKS
11950,PARALLEL CIRCUITS ARE WHEN THEY UM THE WIRES DON'T CONNECT DON'T UM TOUCH EACH OTHER IN THEIR CIRCUIT AND HAVE SEPARATE CIRCUITS FOR EACH LIGHT BULB,CU WWATORS DONT TUCH EACHOTHER IN THE CIRCUS AND HAVE  IRCUST FB
11951,THE THE UM ELECTRICITY BLUE DOTS ARE IT'S FLOWING THROUGH THE LIGHT BULB QUICKLY AND GOING THROUGH ITS LITTLE CIRCUIT AND COMING BACK OUT,TTOUSLY BLUEDA FLOWING THRO THE ICKL AGOIN SD WITH L SIRCUS N
11952,GOOD,GOOD
11953,THIS IS UM A DRAWING THAT OF THE BATTERY AND LIGHT BULBS IN THEIR CIRCUIT,TIS IS A DROING THE BATER LAE BO IN THE CIRCUT
11954,WE'VE BEEN WORKING WITH PARA PARALLEL CIRCUITS,WE'VE BEN AING WITH PALLEL CIRCUTS
