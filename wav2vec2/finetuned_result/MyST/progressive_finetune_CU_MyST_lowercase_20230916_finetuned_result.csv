1292,actually the wind might also be helping evaporate,actual wun might also be helping evaporate
1293,well jungle is for moistness cause it has more rain but desert has even if you did put a little water there it'd evaporate really quickly cause the temperature is so hot,well jungle is full of moistnous cause it has more brain but at desert has even if you did pub to water ter and evaporate rearly quickly cause the temperature is so hot
1294,different,different
1295,when it's warm it loses more because um when it's warm that helps the evaporation,when it is warm it loases more because um when it's warmed it helps yoe evaporation
1296,it would easily come and evaporate the water,it would easily come and evaporate the water
1297,when the air's full of moisture or when it's humid when well when the air is full of moisture it has less chance of evaporating but it's humid it has a way better chance of evaporating,when the airis fo more short an when it's humid when well when th air's ful of moixture it has thes trans evaporate but human is a wy better chance of evaporating
1298,um because it's pushing it away from the heat,um because it's pushing it away from the heat
1299,it evaporates and sometimes it makes a little rain cloud,evaporates and sometimes it makes a litt of rain craft
1300,it evaporates less than the desert,it evaporates west and it desert
1301,well cause well it kinda slows it down cause it pushes the water away instead of bringing it nearer for the um temperature to evaporate,well cause well it kind of sls it down bcause it pushes the water away instead of bringing it neaer for the um temperature to evaporate
1302,good thank you,good thank you
1303,um we've been learning about evaporation,um we've beenlearning about evaporatioon
1304,when it's very cool like twenty two or twenty degrees or lower it only loses zero or one milliliter,well when it's a vericle lect twenty two or twenty degrees  or wler it only ruses zero or one milliliter
1305,no i'm trying to say that more water evaporates in a desert than it does in a jungle,no i'ms trying to sayd more water evaporates an the desert than it doesin't he jungle
1306,well since you you can more see that b c d um that well the higher the temperature the more water loss,well since your ordomium you can more seed at b c t um that well the higher the temperature the more water was
1307,thank you marnie she's,thank you marnieshe
1308,well that's weird it's um the temperature is plus two for a and b then it's minus five for b and c and then it's minus two for d and c,well that's whe it's um the temperature is plus two for a and b then it's minus five for b and c and in it's minus two for d and c
1309,well we put em in different places to see if they evaporate faster,well we put t in different places to see if they evaporate faster
1310,we put one up high which is in the ceiling we put one by a computer which is near static electricity and we put one in the fridge which could be hot or warm or cold,you put one a pie which is in the sieling we put one by a computer which is nhestotic electricity and we put one in the fridge which could be hot or warm or cold

1324,thank you,thank you
1325,it goes north or up cause the water is making it go up the heat actually um yeah so yeah basically,it goes north or up cause the water is making it go up to heat actually um yeah so yeah basically
1326,the temperature's hot so it's going up up up up up but if you make it go down then the temperature would going down down down and it would be have to be cold,the temperature is hot so it's going up up u pu pu but if you make it go down ithen the temperture would going down down down and it would be have to be cold
1327,i did an experiment in class and i know what happens,i do a't experiment in class and i know what happens
1328,i've been doing water uh,i've been doing water uh
1329,hi,hi
1330,um i think it feels um cold,i think you'r feel's um cold
1331,um temperature is all the hot and cold,um temperature is all about hot and cold
1332,d do you have anything else,do you have anything else
1333,when you make it colder it goes south way down but when you make it hotter it goes up or north,whn you make it colder equal south or down but when you make a hotter it goes up or north
1334,thank you and marnie can you say kitty cats,thank you and marnie can you say kicat
1335,chill he,true
1336,more space marnie,more space marnie
1337,i no when um you're maybe doing a science experiment or again seeing when the temperature is outside,right no when um you're metr in a science experiment or again seen when the temperature is outside
1338,um something just came up oh okay,um seven dius ce oh okay
1339,yes i have,yes i have
1340,temperature is um yeah it's hot and cold and when um it is hot it can make the water go up but when it's cold it goes down,i
1341,yeah and yeah yeah but cause it would be um hurtful if,yeah i h yeah yeah but primeers aren't markery an mor cause it would be um heurt full if
1342,thank you,thank you
1343,it goes down or um it takes up s a lot of space,it goes downor um t takes up swest space
1344,we put a thermometer in it and then it tells you temperature if you want to be room temperature you let it stay in the room for a while maybe a day,well you put a thermometer in it and then it tells you a temperature if you want to be room temperature you wouldit stay in the room for a whire maybe day
1345,the temperature below it is hot,e temperature below it is hit
1346,it's about if it's i think it's not too hot not too cold and that would be room temperature wh and it's right there in the middle too hot would be too up too cold would be too down yeah,it's about if it's i think it's not too hot an nout too cold and that would be a room temperature wa and it's right there in the middle too hot itwould be too up too cold to be too down yeah
1347,um thank you marnie can you say kitty cats,um thank you  marnie can you say to et
1348,no cause i already knew about the thermometer so i just thought the thing would be the same,no cause i already knew but but differmonator so i just wat the thing would be the saing
1349,you are absolutely positively right,you are absolutely positively right
1350,um it goes down like you just showed me or low low low low yes that was really cool,um it goes down like you just show me or eloo wel yeah toas ee col
1351,me i thought it was really cool,you mean i fough it was really cool
1352,inside the tube is really water with green food coloring but then it goes up with hot water down with cold yes,insided tobse water with green food covering but then it goes up with hot water down with cold yes
1353,yes,yes

1358,well soil absorbs water gravel lets it go through but sometimes um gravel um gets wet by water that's most of the time what happens,well solia absorbs water gravel lets it go through but sometimes um gravel um gets wet buy no woler that's most of te time what happens
1359,it has it kept some inside it and it let some out so that would basically double the mass the normal mass,it ha it kept some inside it and it wets them out so that would basically doubble the mass the normal mass
1360,the water to the soil the soil absorbed the water,hwater to the sod soil absorbe the water
1361,it's about um how the soil can absorb but a lot but the um gravel can absorb very little,t's about um how the soil can observe but a lot but the um gravel can obsorb very little
1362,comes from us experimenting in the class,comes from us experimentin in the class
1363,i see two triangular things they're kind of like um cones one is soil and one is gravel,i see two tryangular thangs they'r kind of like um cones one if soil and one is gravel
1364,we've been um we've been doing stuff with gravel and soil,we've been um uwe've been doing stuff with gravel and soil
1365,good thank you,good thank you
1366,thank you,thank you
1367,originally i think they came from um well soil came from dirt which god invented and um same thing with gravel except gravel did not come from dirt,wo you know w i tink it came from um well soio came from dirt which got and pantend and um same thing of grah oxuse it gravel did not come from dirt
1368,well um soil can hold more water cause it absorbs it but gravel can hold less water because it does not absorb it,ell um soiol can hold more water cause it absorbs it but gravel can hold less water because it does not absorb it
1369,i watered the gravel the water just went through,i' water to gravel the water just went through
1370,well sometimes the earth material absorbs sometimes the water can go through,well sometimes the orfhat absorbs sometimes of the water can go through
1371,well um it is shorter than the gravel because the soil absorbs the gravel does not cause the gravel is solid the soil is very very soft,well um it is shorter than the gravel because the soil absorbs the gravel doies that cause the gravel is solid the soil is very very soft
1372,that um the um gravel absorbed actually ten milliliters,that um the um gravel absorbed t actually ten milliliters
1373,to um complete further experiments with better experience,put it to  um complete farther experiments with better experients
1374,well most of it went through and um some of it stayed on the rocks to like make the rocks wet wet and yeah the rest went through,well most of it went through and um some of it stayed on the rocks so like make the wrocks wet wet and yeah the west went through
1375,the amount of water that drained through the gravel was less than the it was more than the soil because the soil absorbs the gravel does not,the amount of water that drain food a gravel was less than he was more than the soil because the soil absorbs the gravel does not
1376,well the water drainage of the rocks really doesn't make them that heavy because they're already heavy and it did not absorb,well the water drinige of the rocks reay doesn't make them that heavy because tear ready heavy and et do not absorb
1377,you put it on gravel and it goes through it go it doesn't absorb anything,you put it on gravel air it goes through it cause it doesn't absorb anything
1378,the hot water is less dense that is what it tells me,the hot water is less dense that is what it tells me
1379,um i would say it goes up or north and because the water pushes it up and that shows it's less dense,um i would say it goes up or north and because the water pushes it up and that shows it's west dense
1380,they float cause they have less density than the water,they float cause they have lesdensityd in the water
1381,we've been doing water and today we saw things float and sink actually didn't but we put hot water and cold water and hot water went to the top cold water went to the bottom cause they put food coloring in,we've been doing water intoday we saw fings floatand think actually we did't but we put hou wan an cold water and a hot watour went to sop cold water went to the bottom cause we bout fot coorn et
1382,good bye marnie,good bye marnie
1383,um it is less dense,um it is west dense
1384,thank you,thank you
1385,um it's about the density of the cold water compared to the density of the room temperature water,um it's about the density of the cold water compared to the density of the room temperature  water
1386,some of them will float some of them would not that's what what we were trying to do actually we were just doing hot water cold water,some of tem wol floape some of em were not that's what wheal we were trying to do after we're just doing haw wot on cold water
1387,um that they are more dense than the water,um that they are more dense than the water
1388,um it told me that the cold the cork um was less dense than the water which i did not know,um it told me that the ca the cork um was less dense than the water which i did not know
1389,the cold water um the cold water is um in there and the cold water is actually more dense so it is floating to the bottom and can going all around too,the cold water um the cold water is um in there and the cold water's actually more dense othis floateing to the buttom and can go ing all around o
1390,well they're all about density and which ones are less dense and more dense,well te al about density and which anes are west dense and more dense
1391,m that um not all of a lot of the red water floated to the top but not all of it be you have to even a vial kind of floated to the top when it was done,m that um not all of a lot of the red water for did to drop but not all of it be you have actually even a vial kind of forted to the top when it was done
1392,um it sinks and it sometimes also goes down and spreads,um it sinks and it sometimes obsa goes down and spreads
1393,it means to have the things float instead of means um like they will sink cause they're more dense than the water,it means to have te think bloat instead of most means um like they will sink cause they're more dense in the water
1394,uh um hot water was more dense i mean less dense than the cold i mean than the room temperature water,uh um w hot t water was more dense i mean less dense than the cold i mean tin a room temperature water
1395,they are both less dense and they are both both have the same density,they are both less dense and they are bot both have the same density
1396,that they um would that they are lighter than that they are lighter than the uh less dense than the water,the day um wood that day are whightter than tha they're wighter than the u west dense than the water
1397,true,drew
1398,it is about um how cold water is more dense than room temperature water yeah cold water is more dense than room temperature water,it is about um how cold water is more dense than in room temperature water yeah cold water's more dense than room temperature water
1399,um they um they are sinking because they are more dense than the water,um they um they are sinking because they are more dense dens the water
1400,the red water is floating out of the vial because it is less dense therefore it floats to the top why can't,the red water is floating out of the vial because it is wess dense there fore it ful to the tup o i ge
1401,a good thank you,good thank you
1402,they stay on the bottom of the cup because um they um are more dense than the water so yeah it all is um it all somehow connects to density,tace it on the bottom of the cup because um they um ar more dense an the water so yeah it all is um it' all some how connects to density
1403,it's exposed to air which co which is evaporating it,s exposed to air which which is evapoate t
1404,the hot air,d hot air
1405,in the wider cup cause it has more it has a more of a way to evaporate,and a wider cup cause it has more it has a more of a weg to evaporate
1406,yes,yes
1407,um how big or round the surface area is,um how big or round ta surface ar yea is
1408,well uh yeah they all lost half as i thought,well oh they're they all lost halve as i fought
1409,go good thank you,good good thank you
1410,b is one hundred but c but a is sixteen but there still the same amount of water,well um you can rol over them and you can se that d is two hundred square centimeters c is twenty four
1411,um they are all um yeah they all uh they all have the same amount of water just in different cases,um they're all um yeah theyare la um they all have the same amount of water'just in different caces
1412,the water on the surface is touching um the side of the container,the water on the surface is touching um the side of the container
1413,each one loses half,each one movees healf
1414,this area is the area of the water,this area is the arvea of the water
1415,um i've been um doing evaporation and today was the second day of where we put stuff in places like the refrigerator the ceiling the window sill the cortec computer,um i've been um throghan evaporation and it's today was a second day of where we put stuff in pices like the refrigerator to sling the window so ta cork to a computer
1416,it's about how wide the thing is it was just half because it's so wide and available to be evaporated,it's about how wide the thring is it luses half because it so wide and evaiable to be evaporated
1417,two hundred square centimeters,two or n dosquorce entimeters
1418,well the hotter the room and the wider the surface area the more is evaporating,well ita hotter the room and the wider the surface aria the more's evaporated
1419,good thank you,good thank you
1420,t the paper towel got wet and soon the water was gone but you could see that it had taken the water into its material,the wth the paper towel got wet and soon the water was gone but you could see that it had taken a water into its material
1421,um we've been learning about water and um doing lots of fun experiments and and we've played with normal and soapy and even salt water,um we've been learning about water and um doing lots of fun experiments a and we've piged with normal and soapy and even salt water
1422,just a spot of water but if um but as it i put more drops and it looked started to look like a dome,just a spot of water but it's um but as it i put more drops when it wok startd to look like a dome
1423,yes it was really interesting to do that and learn all about the and you learned some about water that i didn't even know,yes it was really interesting to do that and learn all about the a wears em about water that i didn't even know
1424,you have to tilt the paper and sometimes it doesn't work eventually if you tilt it enough it does,you have to till the paper and sometimes it doesn't work but iventur if you tot oit enough it does
1425,thank you you are very kind,thank you you a're very kind
1426,because the all the um drops of water i think they go together and just they make that shape and cause it's a certain material it doesn't just fall flat,because the oda um drops of water i think they go together and just to make that shape and cause it's sert a material it doesn't just fall fat
1427,water tension is the thing that makes it shape like anything it wants to be like,what tention is the thing that makes it shape like anything it wants to be like
1428,it i meant by like what as when you put in more drops on the um soapy water it can hold less than a penny can hold with normal water,it i rmemby like it w as when you put more drops on the um soapy water it can hold west than tha penny can hold with normal water
1429,it looks like a tear drop,it looks like a tear drop
1430,so the puddle was so cool it was just like a dome which i believe is the scientific term for something,so the puddle was so cool it was just like a donme which i bel wheepe it's a scientific turm for something
1431,bye she's,bye she
1432,good thank you,good thank you
1433,it goes up into the air,it goes up into the air
1434,um oh wait sorry i,uh please repeat uh wait sorry i
1435,m cold cold water,in cold cold water
1436,well um in one it's cold water which causes surface tension to break and uh water vapor to be seen then eventually goes up to air and turns into what it was,well um and when it's called water which caused tae survuce tentin to break in a water vapor to be seen en o then the goes up the air and turns into what it was
1437,well we've been doing condensation and evapora and then mostly condensation but a little bit of evaporation,well we've been doing condensation and evpor  and then mostly condensation but a little bit of evaporation
1438,um well some thing's that evaporate are water and water hot water cold water any kind of water,wwell um well somethings that evaporate or water and water hot water called water any kind of water
1439,all about the wind carrying the water in the air to different places,all about the wind carrying the water an the air it's a different places
1440,like a big lake or yeah big lake and wet,like a big like or youah a big like and wet
1441,k people make condensation chambers to see if condensation happens in the chamber,o people make condensation chanbos to see if condensation happens in theur chamber
1442,um water evaporates and hot water and cold water evaporates too well that's still water but yeah,um water evaporates and hot water and cold water evaporates too or else thil water but yeah

1444,air,air
1445,true,true
1446,water droplets form at whatever part has space they get separated into little little little ones make really big a really big one,water drop whits form at whatever apart has space thike it separate into little wittle lidtle ones mike really bit a really big one
1447,good,good
1448,um it's kind of like the vapor version of water,um it's kind of like the vappovorsion of water
1449,eleven twenty four see one one two four connection lost press okay and wait for marnie okay,well i fir all about how the water vaposnake in and now you can see water vapo wit a bubbles of air wha look like air anyway
1450,true,true
1451,well condensation,odesation
1452,um it's like little circles but when it goes on the hot surface you can actually see it and when you touch it it becomes little droplets like little rain drops tears that kind of thing,um it's like widow circles but when it goes on hosivious you can actually see it and when you touch it it becomes witdow drop what's like what ot rain drops tars thike kind of fing
1453,um it was about seeing if condensation happened in the chamber,um it was about seein if conrn happened in the chamber  oread
1454,hello my um,hello marni um a
1455,yeah well it's not that loud,yeah well it's not that aloud
1456,mmm they attract to any piece with well it depends with any piece with iron if they have iron in it because there's a minus and a plus side,they attract to any piece with well it depends with any piece with iron if they have iron int because there's a minus and a plus side
1457,yeah and it's a lot of com it's pretty complicated,yeah and it's a lot of c it's pretty complicated
1458,the it it doesn't work doesn't it it just doesn't do anything it just stays where it is,the it it doesn't work doesn't it it just doesn't do anything just stays where it is
1459,the switch i just have to hit it,the switch i just have to hat it
1460,cause we don't have strong enough batteries we just use d cell batteries,cause we don't have strong enough batteries we just used d cell batteries
1461,just that the power was stronger and,just that the power was stronger an
1462,they just push it forward but there's like this magnetic field in it that's blocking it and just pushing it out but then when you clamp it just and then you let go it just flies out,they  just push it ford but there's like this magnet field in it that's blocking it just pushing it out but then i miona clamp i just and then you let go just flyes out
1463,a the repelling,uh the repelling
1464,y y if one of it has iron in it yes,y y if one of it has iron in it yes
1465,then the electricity is broken a circuit,there and the electricity is broken circuit
1466,mmm yeah,yeah
1467,um the battery was just giving the electricity and power for it to flow through and then yeah do it make a circuit and then make also a magnet at the same time,um the battery was draws giving the electricity and power for it to flow through and then yeah do it make a circuit and then it make also a magnet at the same time
1468,um if you turned it well the switch can actually telegraph the thing you have to take the um switch and hit it against the metal part,um if you turned it  well the switch to actually telegraph the thing you have to take it um switch and hite it against the metal part
1469,magnetic f magnetic force uh i it um if the nother magnet then you can attach like not just be attracted and,magnetic magnetic force u  it um if there's another magnet then you can attach like no ucd t be attracted and
1470,uh just like one centimeter away from you,uh just like one centimeter away from you
1471,it would like from far away like if you put the metal bar far away then it will con still do it and then you can show how how strong it is,it like from far away like if you put the metal bar far away then it'l can sh still do it and then you can show how how strong it is
1472,it's a pathway for electricity,it's a pathway for electricity
1473,a,u
1474,so so when you kept hitting the thing with the bar that on the switch then the there's this bar here that was hitting on the rivet,so so when you kept itting the thing with the bar that um the switch then the there w's the spar here that was hitting um the rivet
1475,yeah,yeah
1476,then it hits it but then it sticks so that's why you have to hit it back and forth really quick,them it hits it but then it sticks so that's why you have to hit it back and forth really quick
1477,paper well paper clips do work but paper clips and paper clips don't stick together,paper well paper clips do work but paper clips and paper clips don't stick together
1478,they're inside the wires the electricity is flowing,the'r inside the wires the electricity is flowing
1479,me maybe possibly yeah,m maybe possible yeah
1480,no,no
1481,th they would just being used,th they were just being used
1482,it makes the bar hit against the rivet,it makes the bark hit against the rivet
1483,yeah,yeah
1484,yeah it's a magnet but the magnet was used to also make um the talking clicks,yeah it's a magnet but the magnet was used to also make um they're talking clicks
1485,north and north won't attract south and south won't attract i think,north and north won't attract south and south wole attract i think
1486,the electricity did something to it,the electricity did something doit
1487,yeah yeah,yeah yeah
1488,well with other experience we did it,well with other experients we did it
1489,yeah the electricity was f fing jumping,yeah the electricity was e thing jumping
1490,um south and north would attract,um south and north would attract
1491,yep,yup
1492,do,two
1493,yep,yup
1494,you couldn't it just screw it just just ricochets off it it doesn't stay,you couldn't i just go it it just just ricker shays off it doesn't stay
1495,in five wires,ind five wires
1496,yeah,yeah
1497,yeah but it also worked as a telegraph thing,yeah but it also worked as a teloa graph thing
1498,uh nope,uh nope
1499,yeah so it just cutting the circuit,yeah so i'r just cutting the circuit
1500,the negative and the a uwe well we should just say north and south,the negative and the and we well we should just say north and south
1501,yeah,yeah
1502,i just felt it as i don't know just more electricity and,i just felted it as oh know just moure electricity in
1503,the bar that hits the rivet,the bar that hits  the rivet
1504,nope,nope
1505,s because that's what works the best,so because that's what works the best
1506,yeah,yeah
1507,o th well the dredge bar or the bar that hits the rivet,t wa the bridge bar or the bar that hits the rivet

1511,uh we had a group and the we talked within each other,uh we had a group and  then we talked with in each other
1512,no we all used the same thing,no we all use the same thing
1513,you can do a manual one which you just take th the button and then just flick it and just ca e ca do the clicking thing,you can do a manual ong which you just take the boon then  just flick it and just can n do the clicking thing
1514,it would be a lot more powerful,it wold be a lot more powerful
1515,the electromag yeah,the electro yeah
1516,the bar iron some sort of metal that magnets like and that stuff that attract like,the bar iron some sort of metal that magnet it's like and that stuff that attract like
1517,the but what the problem is is that we only had just three wires so we can't use three wires to a to attach two batteries to the switch,the but what the brottem is is that we only had just three wires so we can't use three wires to ad to attach two batteries to the switch
1518,the plus side is the positive and the minus side is the negative side,the plus side is the positive and the minus side is the negative timne
1519,mmm yes because if the positive side does not touch the bottom and the negative side doesn't touch the side it it won't turn on,m yes because if the positive side does not touch the bottom and the negative side doesn't touch the side it it won't turn on
1520,okay,okay

1523,yes,yes
1524,yes they're important,yes they're important
1525,i think it's about the just both sides have to touch the light bulb some,i sheek it's about the just both sides have to touch the light bulb some way
1526,you can use two wires and connect each wire to one of the sides to the negative and positive and connect both wires to the light bulb,you can use two wires and connect each wire to one on the side to the negative positive and connect both wires to the light bulb
1527,the wires and the battery didn't light the light bulb because because they weren't in the right places,the wires and the battery didn't light the light bulb because because they weren't in the right places
1528,yes it didn't light the light bulb,yes it didn't light the light bulb
1529,they're important because without the negative or positive side the light bulb can't light light up,they're important because without the negative or positive side the light bulb can't light light up

2478,i'm going to need help talking,it was basically just like
2479,good,good
2480,is very good uh could you be a little more pacific,is very good uh culd you be little more pecific
2481,bye bye bye ba ba bye bye bye,bye bye bye bb bye bye bye ye
2482,and well i need help hi,because it's basically just doing something different like if i click on this it w'll do something like if i get on the magnet
2483,if you have a magnet right here on this piece on the big piece of paper and a magnet right here on the thin piece of paper and a pencil right here it won't be strong enough to pull towards this with a pencil behind it,if you have a magnet right here on this piece on the big piece of paper and a magnet right here on the thin piece of paper and a pencil right here it won't be strong enough to pull towards this with ta pencil behind it
2484,the force okay,the force okay
2485,well the nail has a magneta field around it so if you put the magnet on it and push it down it's like the magnet will stick to the paper clip always,well the nail has a magnetic field around it so if you put the magnet on it and push it down it's like the magnet will stick to the paper clip always
2486,it's basically just it's basically the paper clip is always gonna be magnetized rather what you do it's going to be magnetized but if you have something too thick the magnet won't stick to the paper clip,it's basically just it's basically the paper clip is always gon be magnetized rather what you do it's goinna be magnetized but if you have tsomething too thick the magnet will stick to the paper clip
2487,the nail isn't forcing the paper clip up to it because the magnet's off it and also the force is off it so the magnet still has a force and abserbed it like it up,the nail is't forceing the paper clip up to it because the magnets off it and also the force is off it so the magnet still has te force and observed it like swelled it up
2488,well mostly i've been like just trying to discover what else is magnets by rubbing a magnet on something that's not magnetized and it worked,well mostly i' fee like just trying to discover what else is magnets by rubbing a magnet on something that's not magnetized and it worked
2489,because of the force is forcing it to stick together,because of the force is forcing it to stick together
2490,okay so it's the gravity it's called a force and if it doesn't stick that's forcing it away from it,okay so it's i the gravity it's called a force and if it doesn't stick that's forcing it away from it
2491,the nail won't pick up the paper clip because it's not magnetized yet,the nail won't pick up the paper clip because tit's not magnetized yet
2492,the nail isn't picking up the paper clip because the force is always in the magnet,the nail isn't picking up the paper clip because the force is always in the magnet
2493,netism basically is very very important,netis only basically s very very important
2494,cause the nail is getting the magnetic force from the magnet so for instance if you kept doing it it will make the paper clip stick,cause the nail is getting the magnetic force from the magnet so for instance if you kept doing it it will make the paper clip stick
2495,it's called a show flow,called a sholl flow
2496,everything will drop because most of the rings are getting stuck from the magnet,everything will drop because most of the rings are getting stuck from the magnet
2497,the rivet is um surrounded by all the wires that are tying it up,the rivet is um surrounded by all the wires that are tighing it up
2498,okay okay can we just move onto another thing,okay okay can we just move on to another thing

2643,you're welcome,you're welcome
2644,if the water's too rough the boat could tip over but if it's calm it'll be easier to put the pennies and it'll stay up,if the water's to rust the boat can't chip over but if it's colmit'll be easier but the pennies then it w'll stay up
2645,then we um we would know how much water it would hold,in the boat and see how much it could hold and um if when it wance it go o went over or its son hen then we
2646,the s the smaller ones well the smaller one won't hold as much and the biggers one will,the the smaller ones will the smaller one won't hold as much and the bigger as one will

2649,the um the cap,that um we
2650,thank you,thank you
2651,f you drop them in it might not hold as much but if you set em in and you keep them even it'll hold more,you drop them in it might not hold as much but if you set em in and you keep em leave and it'll hold more
2652,we made four different sizes to see um which one would,we made four different sizes to see um which one would
2653,if you like put them on one side it would sink over if you balance em it might ha be able to hold more,if you like put them on one side it would sink over if you balance them it might have be able to hold more
2654,they're about when we're trying to see um w how many pennies can fit into it without it sinking and um,and how much water it can go over can it can fip  before it goes over
2655,if you change too many,if you change too many

2658,if you don't use accurate measurements then it could um let's say you do one that's eight centi,if you don't use accurate measurements then it could um let's say you do one that's eat centimt
2659,um there we designed them to hold pennies and to hold a certain amount of water and to see how um much water they could hold,um the're we dessigred them to hold pennies and to hold a certain amount of water and to see how um much water that could hold
2660,okay i'm not sure on this one,okay i'm not sure i'm this one
2661,if the water is like ha it's really tall waves it'll knock em over but if it's calm and kind of flat and just sitting there then it'll be easier to stack them,if the water is like how t's really tall waves it will not come over but if it's coman kind of flat and just sitting there then it'll be easier to stack them
2662,if you only change if you change one variable at a time it will be easier to see if you're doing it right or wrong,if you only change if you change one variable at a time ot'll be easier to see if you're doing it right or rong
2663,that if you stack em it will stay evenly and that it could hold more and if you just kind of put them all over the place it doesn't really work that well without sinking,that if you stack em it'll stay evenly and then it could hold more and if you just kind a put them all over the place it doesn't really work that wile without sinking
2664,you're only stacking on one side and if you stack em on one side it's gonna sink if you stack em in the middle like the one on the left it'll stay up longer,you're only stacking on one side and if you sack em on one side it's gonnta sink if you stuck em in the middle like the one on the left it'll stay up longer
2665,if let's see um we're,if let's see u w
2666,i can't i'm not sure,i can't i'm not sure
2667,to see which one would work better if the smaller one or the medium sized one or the bigger one and so we could just choose different kinds and see what the results are for different ones,to see which one would work better if the smaller one or the medium size one or the bigger one and so we could just cheowse different kinds cand see what the results are for different ones
2668,that the smaller one might hold less amount of pennies and then the medium will hold a little more and a little more and a little more,that the smaller one might hold less amount oth pennies and then the medium wil hold a little more and a little more and a lttle more
2669,if you only change one thing at a time it might be easier to see if that thing made it worse or better,if you only change one thing at a time it might be easier to see if that thing made it wors or better
2670,if you set them down it might be easier to put more in if you kind a just drop em in it might you know make it sink,if you set them down it might be easier to put more in if you kinda just drop em in it might'm gonna make it sink
2671,um let's see if w,um let's see if w
2672,at one time you could,s at one time you could
2673,if they're smaller then it'll be harder to put more pennies in and if they're bigger it'll be easier since they're taller and you can put more pennies in without it sinking,if they're smaller then it'll be harder to put more pennies in and if they're bigger it'l be easier since they're taller and you can put more pennies in without its sinking
2674,if you put them in the middle they'll be able to have more since it's balanced and if you put them kinda everywhere it'll sink faster,if you put them in the middle tey'll be able to have more since it's balanced and if you put them kinda everywhere 'll sink faster
2675,um the smaller ones might not as hold as much pennies because they're not as taller and it'll overflow faster,um the smaller ones might not as hold as much pennies because they're not as taller and it w'lld overflow faster
2676,know if they're wrong or right,nol if they were wrong  right
2677,you should stop there because if you put any more in you'll probably overflow the boat,you should stop there because if you put any more in you'll probably overflow the boat
2678,if you would let's see um,if you would say um
2679,with string and then the other one's supposed to be eight too but if you do one that's accidentally nine it'll end up being a little different,s long othe string and then the other one's supposed to be eight two but if you do one that's accidentally nine it'll end up being a little different
2680,um it was important to make sure there's different sizes and if they weren't different sizes they would just carry the same amount of water and pennies,um it was important to make sure there's different sizes and if they weren't different sizes they would just carry the same amount of water and pennies
2681,well you should um,well you should um
2682,like you could have if you added too many things you,like you could have if you added too many things you
2683,how much how tall the boat was and how wide it was,how much how tall the boat was and how wide it was
2684,once the boat sunk you took one penny out and then counted how many pennies you have left and see that's how many passengers your boat can hold,once a boat sunk you took one penny o and then counted how many pennies you have left and see that's how many passengers your boat can hold
2685,when the boat,when the boat
2686,that the difference if they're wider or taller they'll will hold more water and more pennies,that the difference if they're wider or taller theyl will hold more water and more pennies
2687,the one that's under water has too many pennies because they're all piled up and they're spread out but the one um that's still above is even and it'll be easier,the one that's under water has too many pennies begts are all piled up and they're spread out but the one um that's still above is even and it'll be easier
2688,cause if they were the same then you don't even know if you know other kinds would work better or work less,cause if they were the same then you don't wouldn't know if you know other kinds would work better or work less
2689,well the smaller one might be um might not as m,well the smaller one might be um might not as
2690,if the boat is smaller it'll be harder to put the pennies in since if it had more pressure and weight on it and it's not as tall and it'll sink with more less pennies,if the boat is smaller it'll be harder to put the pennies in since if u hadd more pressure and weight on it and it's not as tall an it'll sink with more less pennies
2691,u,
2692,this week in science we've been working on the capacity of boats with little paper cups and we've been seeing how much water they can hold and how much pennies they can hold,this wek in science we've been working on the capacity of boats will little paper cups and we've been seeing how much water they can hold and how much pennies they can hold
2693,cause it depends how you put the pennies in if you kind of drop em in they might be less if you set em in it might be easier if you put em on one side it might be harder to do that and if you stack em evenly it might have more,cause it depends how you put the pennies in if you kind a drop hem en they might be less if you senttimin it might be easier if you put them on one side it might be harder to do that and if you stack me even light it might have more
2694,bye,bye
2695,yeah we'll probably try out and launch those tommorow,yeah it will probably try out and launch te those tomorrow

2702,can i see a picture of,can i see a picttureo
2703,yeah the rubber band,yeah there rubber band
2704,um probably the flipper base and the um stick that holds it up and the rubber stop,um probably the slipper base and the um stick that holds it up and the rubber stop
2705,well we could instead of a cork we could like use a ball of tin foil like mister suggested or we could use something heavier and that might affect how far it goes,well we cououd instead of a cork we could like use a ball of tin foil like mistering qas siggested or we could use something heavier and that might affect how far it goes
2706,hi,hi
2707,we'll probably make either a graph or we'll probably make a chart,well probably make either a graph or will probably make a chart
2708,yep the weight may um affect how far it goes,yep the weight might um effect how far it goes
2709,can you show me a picture of the flipper,can you show me a picture of the flipper

2712,hold on,um you can use the flipper weace to um set up the um the
2713,yep,yep
2714,we've been making predictions and questions on the flipper and the launcher of the flipper,we've been making predictions and questions on the flipper and the loncher of the flipper
2715,stick is um holding it up and the flipper base is how we hold it up and launch it,lip stick is um holding it up anthe flipper bace is helping hold it up and toch it
2716,um we could see how it could when we spin it how far it could go,um we could see how it could when we spin it how far it could go
2717,well,well
2718,the straws tried to h to hold up the string and the popsicle sticks we narrowed it down so it would fit in to those little things that hold the rubber band and their propeller and that's how it works,the straws try to h to hold up the string and the popsicle sticks we knarried it down so it'd fet into those little things that hold the rubber be in the'r propeller and that's how it works
2719,well the one on the bottom's not as straight as the one on top up and i think that if the one on the top's straighter it'll be easier for it to fly but at the one at an angle it might be harder for,well the one on the bottom's not as straight as the one top and i think that if the one on the top straight or it'll be easier for it to fly but at the one at the angle it might be harder for it
2720,we used popsicle sticks and a propeller and straws and then were we were spinning the propeller twenty five times to see it how far it could get down the string,we used popsicle sticks and a propeller and straws and then wre we were spinning the propeller twenty five times to see it how far it could get down the string
2721,effects how much it can fly,effects how much it can fly
2722,is that you you have the propeller and something that holds the propeller up and then you have,is that you you have the propeller and something that holds a propeller up and then you have
2723,well me and my partner we put our string at an angle and we learned that if you put it at an angle it,well mean my partner we put our string in it andg and we learned that if you put it at a angle it
2724,body of it and then you have something that holds it up and makes it fly,body of it and then you have something that holds it up and makes it fly
2725,peller up so we could se,peller up so we could
2726,well flight line hold,well sight line hold
2727,bye thank you,bye thank you
2728,they they held up the um propeller and it helped to spin it and it kept it from falling down and it helped a lot,they they held up the um propeller and it helped to spin it and it kept it from falling down and it helped a lot
2729,good,good
2730,and making planes with straws on a propeller and we took the string and tied it to two chairs and wind up the propeller and see how far it could get,en making planes with straws on a propeller and we took the string an tite it to two chairs and wind up the propeller and see how far it could get
2731,what makes a propeller so,wat makes up a plane cci
2732,well you need to think about how far you should spread apart your straws and what kind of string you should use and how many times you uh wind up the propeller,well you need to think about how far you thould spiand part your straws and what kind of string you should use and how many times you uh wind up the propeller
2733,hello,hello
2734,what's important is the body the propeller and what the string and what's holding it up,what's important is the body the propeller and what the string and what's holding it up
2735,well how how big the boat is and how tall it is affects how much passengers it can hold,well how how big the boat is and how tall it is affects how much passengers it can hold
2736,we've been making paper boats and seeing the capacity and how much passengers they can hold and we've been doing graphs,we've been making paper boats and seeing the capacity and how much passengers they can hold and twe've been doing graphs
2737,well it depends of the size of the boat how much it can hold and how much you would be able to estimate how much you can it could hold,well it depends on the size of the boat how much it can hold and how much you would be able to escemate how much you can it could hold
2738,if you change too many at one time then you won't know if you got it right at the beginning or that you had too many change or you had just right amount of change,if you changed too many at one time then you won't know if you got it right at the beginning or that you had too many change or you had just right amount change
2739,well the you can you can find that maybe one it like one boat can hold more passengers th and one can hold less but it depends on the size,well that you can you can find that maybe one it like one boat can hold more passengers u and one can hold less but it depends on the size
2740,the higher it gets the more passengers it gets and more capacity it can get,the higher it gets the more passengers it gets an more capacity it can get
2741,what we did here is we we found one,what we did here is we we found we
2742,um if you change one variable then the other if it works better or less then you don't have to change the other variable so you only ch so change one at a time,um if you change one variable then the other if it works better or less then you don't have to change a other variable so you only cso it change one at a time
2743,we were in charge of seeing how much capacity it can hold and how much pennies we can hold and we did four different sizes of boats so we could see what the difference was,we were en taired of seeing how much capacity it can hold and how much pennies we can hold and we did four different sizes of boat so we could see what the difference was
2744,well on the bottom of the graph is how much the number of passenger no yeah is the number of passengers that it can,well on the bottom of the graph is how much the number of passenger not yeah is the number of passengers that it can
2745,well the s smaller the boat is the less passengers it can hold,well the smaller the boat is the less passengers it can hold
2746,good,good
2747,kay yeah,hay yeah
2748,well we,well we
2749,that as the capacity gets higher so does the number of passengers,that as the capacity gets higher so it does the  number of passengers
2750,well on the bottom is uh how much capacity it can hold and the passengers and then,as usually the capacity and the passengers usually stay around the same amount and they really don't have some big difference in between
2751,well we put down how much capacity until we get to the highest number and how much the passengers until we got,well we put down how much capacity untill we get to the highest number and how much the passengers until we got
2752,well they're putting em in the middle so it can hold more but if you put em all to the side it'll tip over um with less amount in pennies than it actually can hold,well they're putting i in the middle so it can hold more but if you put em old to the side it'll tip over um with less amountan pennies than it actually can hold
2753,the different size of the cup depends how much capacity it can hold and how many passengers it can hold,the different size of the cup depends how much capascitty can hold and how many passengers it can hold
2754,we,we eat
2755,well we did four different sizes so that we could tell which one could hold more and which one could hold less,well we did four different sizes so that we could help which one could hold more and which one could hold less
2756,alright so let's see,u so let's see
2757,that the more capacity it can hold the more passengers,that the more capacity it can hold the more passengers
2758,we did four different sizes of boats so we could tell which so if we did all four the same we wouldn't know if different sizes could hold more or less,we did four different sizes a boat so we could tell which so if we did aall for the same we wouldn't know if different sizes could hold more or less
2759,you well that the more if you look at the pattern the more the capacity is the passengers always less the capacity it can hold,but that
2760,it's how capacity is how much water it can hold,its ho capacity is how much water can hold
2761,it shows you what where the where the the capacity and the passengers meet up on the graph,it shows you what where the where the the capacity and the passengers meat up in the graph
2762,uh um they're and uh um x and the y are matched up so they're pretty much the same,uh um they're both the sm musstings and uh um x the r are matched up so they're pretty much the same
2763,well the more you add the passengers the distance will it it won't go as far,well the more you add the passengers the distance will an it won't go as far
2764,so you can um,so you can um
2765,hello oh my,hello
2766,okay bye,okay bye
2767,well we um listed the numbers of passengers and the distance and we realized that the more passengers you have the um it doesn't go as far,well we um listed the numbers of passengers in the distance and we realized that the more passengers you have the um it doesn't go as far
2768,well it's um other side so it'll be easier to list,well it's placed like on the other sides it wiuld be easier to lism
2769,we've been making pa we've been making planes and testing um them and seeing we've been changing some variables and seeing what it would do,we've been making pap we've been making planes an testing um them and seeing we've been changing some variables and seeing what they would do
2770,the number of the numbers that it goes up to the number of passengers and the distance and how far that goes up to,the number of lihum  the numbers that it goes up to the number of passengers and the distance and how far that goes up town
2771,well you place the y there because it's on the line of the and then it'll be it'll be like right there so you it's easier,well  you place it wy there because it's on the line of the red and then it 'll be it'll be like rit there so o it's easier
2772,well x is number of motors or rubberbands and y is the distance,well x is number of motors a rubber bands and y is a distance
2773,it'll go pretty far,pands it'll go pretty far
2774,well we could change like how many rubberbands we had or put on some extra passengers or me and my partner made wings,well we could change like how many rubber bands we had or put on some extra passengers or mean my partner made wings
2775,okay,okay
2776,well you can,well you can'
2777,well um usually it doesn't matter but you have to like list like the number of passengers and the distance and it doesn't exactly matter what side you put it on though,well um usually it don't matter but you have the like list like the number of passengers of adistance and it doesn't exactly matter what side you put it on though
2778,well that so we could tell which the difference is and it'll be easier to explain,well that so we could tell which to the difference is and itw'll be easier to explain
2779,and but he thought it was sixty two milligrams and he thought that it it was monster,and but he thought it was sixty two ilegrams and he thought that te it was a monster
2780,a hundred,a hundred
2781,a gram's about as much as a paper clip,ump grams about as much as a paper clip
2782,that there's a hundred grams there,that there's a hundred grams there
2783,milligram weighs as much as i don't know maybe a grain of sugar or a grain of salt maybe i don't know i don't really i'm not sure but,a milligram ways as much as i don't know maybe a green of sugar or grain of salt maybe i don't know i don't really in then that's sure but
2784,um mmm let's see,um let's se
2785,okay,okay
2786,yeah let's see i wanna see the tips i wanna s look at the tips what does i mean,m yeah let's see i want na see the chips i wantna s look at the chips what does i mean
2787,i've been well i didn't know i think but on friday we we just heard about a gram we just heard about a gram like on friday,i've been well thust i i didn't know i think but on friday we we just heard about a gram we just heard about a gram lik on friday
2788,a hundred,a hundred
2789,okay,an
2790,yeah,yeah
2791,um like having it on there,um only like having it on there
2792,it was the interactive tips,s the interactive clips
2793,i actually learned that from mother and father because i didn't learn any th uh i haven't learned that that much about grams from my teacher because well we,i actually learned that from a mother and father mecause i didn't learnd any s u haven't learned that that much about grams for my teach or because well we e e
2794,no,no
2795,um that the net one of the beans equals a gram,um that the net one of the beans equals a gram
2796,and also i like x and i've also heard exograms my mother and father told me about that and also,and also i like  and i've also heard about x agrams my mother and father told me about that and also
2797,um twenty grams,un twenty grams
2798,um you s the balance would be straight it wouldn't be sorta slanted,um ou the balance would be straight it wouldn't be swoit is slanted

2801,one equals one gram five what's a five five grams it's a five gram,one equal's one gram five what's a five five grams tt's a five gramm
2802,just weighs as much i mean,fest  weighs as much i mean
2803,um paper cli um one side was um,um paper clp on one side was um
2804,yeah,yeah
2805,all of those things went in and the orange weighed more,all of those things went in and the orange weighed more
2806,mmm yeah thousands,m yeah thousand
2807,one side was the,one side was the
2808,okay but i wanna see the interactive chips,okay but i want ta see the interact ive chips
2809,um we would add one hundred if it wasn't enough,um we would add one hundred if it wasn't enough
2810,mmm you could hold it steady there no no oh um,you could hold it studyou there no no uh ium
2811,mmm each side would weigh the same and it would be one line,m each side would weigh the same and it would be  one line
2812,milligram is a s thousandth of a gram with a thousandth of a gram,a milligram is as thousandth of a gram weighs a thousandth of a gram
2813,a hundred beans equals,a hundred beans equals
2814,um a a gram is just about as much as a paper clip,um a r a gram is just about as munchas a paper clip
2815,different masses i wanna see the different masses,different masses i want to see the different masses
2816,th the th the thing the yeah,the the snake the thing the yeah

2819,um three actually thirty five,um three actually for seventy five
2820,we we can add more of that stuff,we we can add more of that stuff
2821,and we did weigh it with paper clips,and we did weighit with paper clips
2822,wait,wait
2823,oh those things push out the water and it's wherever this little point is that's how much water is in there,oh those things push out the water and it's wherever this stit point is that's how much water is in there
2824,oh a hundred yeah a gram is equal to a hundred of those,oh a hundred yeah a gram is equal to a hundred of those

2869,well that tells you how much water it is,well that tells you how muth water it is
2870,i'll get it,'ll get it
2871,yeah that's,yeah that's o
2872,hey i think this is on backwards that's why it's keeps on falling off,i think this is on backwards that's why it's some fulling uff

2878,before that looked like before sorry gr no not that one w did we do this one,before that looked like before us hury gra kno not that one w did we do this one
2879,well like well um because then some people say that it's this amount w of vials and some people say it's th a different amount,well like well um because then some people say that it's this amount l of vials and some people sigh t's a different amount
2880,um prob probably milliliters,um proprobably milliliters
2881,mmm that's a hundred that's a thousandth of it that's a tenth and that's tenth of it and that's a whole of it,mthat's a hundred that's a thousandth of it that's ha tenth and that's a tenth of it and that's a whole of it
2882,oh yeah those,oh yeah thes
2883,what,rigt
2884,no no neither we haven't done it yet,no no neither ey haven't done it yet
2885,um a hundred milliliters,um a hundred milliliters
2886,no let's s compare vials yeah that's like what ours were,no let's see compare vials  yeah uh that's like what ours were
2887,mmm wha the what'd you say paying attention i was thinking about this thing,we the wu what d you say  wasn't pink demsinor think you about this thing
2888,no no no a gram,no no no a gram
2889,that like in the i'm th the thing about,that like in the unthe thing about
2890,yeah we used that thing,yeah we used that thing
2891,then for those you just pour it in for those you pour some you put water in those,and for those you just pour it in for those you pour  some you put water in those u
2892,two hundred milliliter graduated cylinders equal what's that,two hundred milliliter graduated cylinders equal what's that
2893,yeah,yeah
2894,yeah,h  yeah
2895,it's interactive or in soda look see it says orange soda,it's interactive or ansodaa like t itsays oan soda
2896,that's two hundred milliliters but what what is it called is what i'm wondering oh a tray,that's two hundred milliliters but what what is it called is what i' wondering oh tre
2897,yeah,yeah
2898,mmm no no we have one cup and it has an a line a b line a c line a d line,h no no we have one cup and it has an a line o b line n a c line a d line
2899,um how many oh that's a thousand in that big thing in one liter,um how many oh that's a thousahndred in that big thing and tone liter
2900,well because that's one's wide it's too flat and those two out it would be the same size as that,well because that one's wide if you flat ind those two out it would be the same size as that
2901,what was the soda can the interactive soda can i like the interactive ones aw,or is the soda can the interactive soda cannel i like the interact ive ones uh
2902,yeah that was a long time ago that was before winter break,yeah that was tha long time ago that was before wenter break
2903,well by those things on the,well by those things on the
2904,well m l stands stands for milliliters and then the number in front of it that's how many milliliters it is,well m  stowns fstands for milliliters andthen the number in front of it that's how many milliliters it is
2905,yeah mmm well not well sort of that's sort of like what we did last time,yeah m well not well sort of that's sort of like what we did last time
2906,we what you do is you have to have you look at where the water's lined up and the one that the water is lined up to is the one that you're,y what you do is you have to have you look at where the water's lined up and the one o the water's lined up to its po tha yur
2907,but i wanna look at the int that's the only interactive thing though,but i want na look at that int that's the only interactive thing about
2908,milliliters are um are thousandths of a liter they're thousandths of a liter,milliliters are um ar thousandth of a liter they're thousandth of a liter
2909,because the vials were different yeah s milliliters,because the vials were different yeah smilliliters
2910,uh huh but i wanna videotape my tonsils,but i want no vintoretate my tonsils
2911,milliliters,milliliters
2912,um fifty most of are graduated cylinders but those ones have a hundred,um fifty most of our graduated cylinders but those onces have a hundred
2913,and you pull water out of the you pull the water out of the cup and into the syringe and then you squirt it back in and then measure the amount of water that was in the cup with the syringe,and you pull water out of the uh you pull the water out of the cup and into the syringe n then you squared it back in and then you measure the amount of water that was in the cup with the syringe
2914,uh the syringe is a is a thing that sorta sucks up water it's and then it tells you how much is in there that you sucked up,of the syringe is i is a thing it sort o sucks up water it's and then it tells you how much isin' there that you sucked up
2915,and we weren't using vials we l used vials a long time ago,no we weren't using vials we used vials a long time ago
2916,wait how is that po pos i wanna look at that again i forgot how how is that possible oh yeah counting the top it was possible,so wait how was that p poss i wantn look at that again i forgot how how was that possible oh yeah counting the top it was poss
2917,no but whoa a hundred millili that looks ne equals,no but wel a hundred milli that looks neeat equals
2918,it's the only interactive one,stam l interactive li
2919,one liter,one liter
2920,um um hmm not really,um um h not really
2921,um oh that one's really well that one is the same as that so that one weighs the same as that other one the middle one that we saw before in that thing and that was two hundred,um oh that one's really well that one is the same as that so that one was the same as that other one the middle one that we saw before and that thing and that was two hundred
2922,syringes yes you just ta i ju hey i just saw a syringe i just saw fifty and we also lews used fifty milliliter ones,syringes yeas you just ha i just hi this sasyringi the sa fifty and we also just used fifty milliliter ones
2923,maybe that's a wait but there's something a bit in inaccurate there they the it isn't exactly because look see that thing's the same amount wide as that oh it might be l longer that way,heih but that's a ait but there's something abut an interaccurate there the it didn't it diesn't exactly because look see that things the same amount why i's that oh it might be longer that way
2924,yeah with no,yeah whit's no
2925,um well because we wouldn't know if it was exactly two hundred milliliters,um well because you wouldn't know if it was exactly two hundred milliliters
2926,mmm oh yeah we measured our desk with straws,m oh yeah we measured our desk with straws
2927,um well,um well
2928,ten are in one ten millimeters are in one centimeter,ten ar in one ten millimeters are in one centimeter
2929,those things marks centimeters okay,those things marks centimeters okay
2930,okay,okay
2931,um a meter is three point something feet,um a meter is three point something feet
2932,um it's a meter tape and you write your name there,um it'so me a tape and you'e wat you'r name is theare
2933,mmm reading writing and math mainly,um reading riting and math mainly
2934,a millimeter,m millimeter
2935,one ten millimeter equals one teeny centimeter,ones ten millimeter  equals one teen e sind to me
2936,by to yeah because to be a nine tenth is al i mean two and nine tenths is almost three,cloy two yeah because three and nine tenth is a i mean two and nine tenth is almost three
2937,by to it because like most people desks were three by two but mine was two and nine tenths by two,cos to it because like most people desks with three by two but mine was twand nine tenth by two
2938,no the it uh it isn't colored at all,nos it it do  it diesn't colored at all
2939,because my desk seemed shorter than all the other ones at my table,because my desk seemed tworter and all the other ones at my table

3872,well in a wet sponge all you really have to do is put it in the water for a sec and you don't and you don't w and you don't make it soak up all the way,well in the wet sponge all you really have to do is put it in the water for ta sec and you don't nd you don't and you don't make it soake up all the way
3873,the dry sponge is gonna weigh it's going to weigh the least um the wet sponge the wet sponge is gonna to weigh a little bit more and the soaked sponge is gonna weigh the most,the dry sponge is gonn weigh it's goina weigh the least um the wet sponge the wet sponge is goingna weigh a little bit more and the soaked sponge is gonna weigh the most
3874,um well what you can do is see that like um that th a wet sponge and a dry sponge and a soaked sponge will all weigh different amounts,um well what you can do is c that like um that the a wet sponge and a dry sponge and a sake sponge woill all weigh different amounts
3875,the sponge is dry it should be pretty hard and it should be um pretty it should be pretty hard and it and it should be pretty small also,sponge is dry it should be pretty hard and it should be um pretty it should be pretty hard and t and it should be pretty small l so
3876,we have been um measuring the mass of stuff,what have wen we have been um measuring the mass of stuff
3877,well the dry sponge or the wet sponge so the the water the water is what makes is what makes the wet sponge heavier so that's why what i just told you works,well the dry sponge on the wet sponge so the the water the water is what makes is what makes the wet sponge heavier so that's why what it just told you works
3878,you um you use gra you put grams in the other side you put grams in the other side to figure out how heavy the sponge is,you um you used gra you put grams in the other side you put grams on the other side to figure out how heavy the sponge is
3879,you don't want to measure too heavy things or else i ca or else you can't put enough grams in one side and you won't and it will be like extra heavy,f you don't want to measure too heavy things or else it c or else you can't put enough grams in one side and you won't and it'llbe like extra heavy
3880,um well you have the dry sponge or the wet sponge so the wet sponge you minus the you minus the grams of the wet sponge and when you minus the grams of the dry sponge to the wet sponge,um well you have the dry sponge of the wet sponge so the wet sponge you minus the you minus the grams of the wet sponge i mean you minus the grams of the dry sponge to the wet sponge
3881,well when i looked through it i figured out that the wet sponge is heavier and it is sixteen grams,uh when it look through it i forget out that the wet sponge is heavier and it is sixteen grams
3882,well i observed that there is three grams in one cup and then there's the sponge and the li and the two lines match up on the balance so that means that the sponge is three grams,well i observed that there is three grams in one cup and then there's the sponge and the lo and the two liones match up on the balance so that means the sponge is three grams
3883,a soaked sponge will be bigger a lot heavier because it's full with water and yeah,a soaked sponge will be bigger a lot heavier because it's full with water and yeah
3884,it is going good,it is going good
3885,goodbye,good bye
3886,um i do what i just did but with a wet sponge,um i do what i just did but with a wet sponge
3887,the dry one will be the least heaviest the wet one will be heavier and bigger and the soaked will be the biggest and the heaviest,the dry one will be the least heaviest the white one will be heavier and bigger and the saked u ni'll be the biggest hand the heaviest
3888,um the wet sponge was heavier than the dry sponge,um the wet sponge is heavier than the dry sponge
3889,we find out that um the dry sponge is not very big um and it doesn't look too heavy,wou find out that um the dry sponge is not very big um and it doesn't look too heavy
3890,um well we used a balance to figure it out and um with grams we would try to even everything out,um well we used a balance to figure it out and um with grams we would try to even everything out
3891,well the sponge in the middle would be little less heavier than the soaked cause it won't be soaked all the way and and it'll be big bigger and heavier than the dry,well the sponge an tha middle would be a little less heavier than the soarched becase it wodn't be soaked all the way and and it'll be bigg bigger and heavier than the dry
3892,um uh what is going on is there's this sponge this sponge is heavier than the than the empty cup so so the cup with the sponge is going is um tipping over,um uh what it's going on is there's the sponge the sponge is heavier than the than the empty cup so so the cup with the sponge is going is um tipping over
3893,the wa the thing is um the thing in the right cup is a lot heavier than the air,the wab the thing is um the thing in the right cup is a lot heavier than the air
3894,i noticed that the sponge is exactly three grams in this picture,i noticed that the sponge is exactly three grams in this picture
3895,you were trying to figure out how heavy how heavy each object was,you were trying to figure out how heavy how heavy each object was
3896,you can use your balance like to figure out how heavy for example you can figure out how heavy a piece of a cu a gold coin is or money,you can use your balance like to figure out how heavy for example you can figure out how heavy a piece of a c a gold coin is or mouny
3897,um well you can measure,um well you can measure
3898,it tells me that um you would just basically um one gram is like half of a gram a kilogram is half of a gram,it tells me that um you would just kep basically um one gram is like half of a gram a kilogram is half ofa a gram
3899,so um i don't know,so um i don't know
3900,i found out that the shoe was one thousand one hundred grams,i found out that the shoe was one thousand one hundred grams
3901,i figured out that the orange was three hundred twenty five grams,i figured out that the orange was three hundred twenty five grams
3902,you couldn't do it because there's not enough gram pieces,you couldn't do it because there's not enough gram pieces
3903,you could um get you could make um one hundred gram gram piece and then you could put that in and see what how it was going then,you could um get you caun make um one hundred gram gram piece and then you could put that in and see what how it was going then
3904,we were seeing like how many gram blocks it took to like weigh a pencil a glue stick a scissors a ruler and a thermometer,we were seeing like how many gram blocks it took to like weigh a pencil a gluue sick a ciser's a ruler and a thermometer
3905,you um so you i can't tell anymore i kind of said it all,you um so you b i can't tell anymore i kind of said at all
3906,one thousand,one thousand
3907,you would use it when there like when it's bigger when something weighs more than one thousand,you would use it when they're like when it's bigger when something weighs more than one thousand
3908,i noticed that there are five twenties which equal one hundred and then there's gravel on the other side so the gravel must be one hundred grams,i noticed that there are five twentys which equal one hundred and then there's gravel on this other side soum the gravel must be one hundred grams
3909,it tells me that the metal disk is eight grams,it tells me that the metal desk is eight grams
3910,grams are the um metric system of weight of weight and mass i think,grams are the um metric system of weight of weight and mass i think
3911,i observed that there is um i don't see i don't really observe anything,i observe that there is um i don't see you i don't really observe anything
3912,you can f you i don't know,you can y i don't know
3913,you would get a really accurate um answer,you would get a really accurate um answer
3914,um two of the two of the five grams it equals a ten gram and then after you have two ten grams it equals a twenty gram,when you have um five blue little grams then it equals five um one has a five grams and once you have
3915,to use you would need to use the same if you were measuring a pencil you would need to use the same pencil and um and you would need to use grams,to you you would need to use the same if you were measuring a pencil you would need to use the same pencil and um and you would need to use grams
3916,you would you would um d do you would do um like you would measure s you would weigh it with something that's a thousand grams or more,you would you would ave um ddce you would do  um like you would measure sup you would weigh it with something that's  a thousand grams or mmore
3917,i noticed that that um i don't that maybe that there is ten kilograms in one gram,i noticed that um i do that maybe that there's ten kilograms and one gram
3918,i'm good thank you,i'm good thank you
3919,when you weigh an apple or an orange um you would need a lot more like materials that you can measure and actually get it balanced,when you wet an apple or ang orange um you would need a lot more like material so you can measure it and actually get it balanced
3920,the car in the picture weighs seventy grams,the car in the picture weighs seventy grams
3921,you could use it as a reference because if you had a nickel you could know you can like if you had a lot of nickels you could put em in a cup and then measure it like that,you could use it as a reference because if you had a nickl you could know you can like if you had a lot of knickls you could put em in a cup and then measure it like that
3922,a kilogram is less than a gram you use it when something's less than a gram,a kilogram is less than a gram you use it when some thing's less than a gram
3923,um i would describe em that it would go down really far and then it started to go up up up,um i would just scribe em that it would go down really far and then it started to go up up up
3924,that um in ten minutes it dropped all the way to it dropped a the way to ten,that um in ten minutes it dropped all the way two it dropped uh the way to ten
3925,i discovered that it got much colder,i discovered that it got much colder
3926,um you can look at it and you know because the starting thermometer is at twenty and the finishing thermometer is at five,um you can look at it and you know because the starting thermometer is at twenty and the finishing thermometer is at five
3927,um the temperature is changing,um the temperature is changing
3928,it dropped fifteen celsius,it dropped fifteen celsius
3929,and then you would add em together and get your answer of how ma difference it was,and then you would ad em together and get your answer of how much difference it woauld
3930,it helps because you can know how it rises in time and how it drops in time,it helps because you can know how it rises in time and how it drops in time
3931,they're about like about i don't know that,they help you they're are like about
3932,i displayed it by writing it on a piece of paper and yeah,we dussplayed it by writing it on a piece of paper and yeah

4076,i forget,i forget
4077,on c the temperature is twenty degrees,um see the temperature is twenty degrees
4078,it works better because then you get the accurate the correct answer and yeah,it works better because then you get the accurate the correct answer and yeah
4079,you use a thermometer to measure the temperature of something,you use a thermometer to measure the temperature of something
4080,i do not know,i do not know
4081,it measures,something
4082,um there is no more i can say,um there is no more i can say
4083,i do not know that,i do not know that
4084,i think he is trying to figure out w um which one is hottest which one is coldest and which one is in between,i think hi's trying to figure out um which one is hottest which one is coldest and which one is in between
4085,yesterday we used our fingers to see um if cup a cup b or cup c's w water was warmer,yesterday we used our fingers to cee um if cup a cup b your cup c swater was warmer
4086,so that everybody can know like have a standard thing for like room temperature and like when you don't go outside and stuff like that,so that everybody can know like have a standard thing for like room temperature like when you don't go at side and stuff like that
4087,we estimated with our finger,we estimated with our finger
4088,you can sense the different temperatures of the water,you can send the different temperatures of the water
4089,um i do not know,um i do not know
4090,good,good
4091,i do not know that,i do not know that
4092,it tells you that it's much much colder,it tells you that it's much much colder
4093,we used a thermometer to see the temperature in the water,we used a thermometer to see the temperature in the water
4094,i think about is it hot cold or just warm,i think about is it hot cold or just warm
4095,so that you can all know the exact temperature of the water and nobody will get confused in between which one is warmer and which one is colder,so that you can all know the exact temperature of the water and nobody will get confused in between which one is warmer and which one is colder
4096,we were seeing ha which cup was warmer and we figured out that the b cup was the coldest but a and c were the same temperature,we were seeing how which cup was warmer and we figured out that d b cup was the coldest but a and c were the same temperature
4097,it's when it's hot when it goes up and it's cold when it's go dow when it goes down,it's when it's hot when it goes up and it's cold when it's go down and when it goes down
4098,you u we're using celsius in this unit,you you were using celsius in this unite
4099,um we we i found out that the it went in between fifty and ten which is thirty and yeah,um we  wev i found out that the it went in between fifty and ten which is thirty and yeah
4100,we're mixing the ice and the co and the hot water together and we're gonna get a new temperature of water,we're mixing the ice and the col in the hot water together and we're't gong get a new tempera chure of water
4101,we put a thermometer in,we put a thermometer in
4102,you use grams,you use grams
4103,i found out that the dry sponge was three grams and that but that it was three grams,i found out that the dry sponge was three grams and that what that it was three grams
4104,i forget and i don't know,i forget and i don't know
4105,a soaked sponge um i don't know,a saked sponge um i don't know
4106,i know that if you um put a dry sponge in water that it will like z absorb and get much bigger,i know that if you um put it a dry sponge in water that it will ab absorb and get much bigger
4107,um the s i observed that the sponge the dry sponge soaked up um thirteen grams of water,um this i observed that the sponge the dry sponge soaked up um thirtreen grams of water
4108,um i don't really know anymore,um i don't really know anymore
4109,the sponge in the middle is wet and it doesn't have as much water in it as the soaked sponge,the sponge in the middle is wet and it doesn't have as much water in it as the soated sponge
4110,i noticed that the dry sponge equals three grams,i noticed that the dry sponge equals three grams
4111,you um when you don't you would count you count the grams and the cup without the sponge in it,you um when you don't you would count you count the grams in the cup without the sponge in it
4112,i noticed that um that they were balanced and the white thing was in line with the blue um line,i noticed that um that they were balanced and the white thing was in line with the blue um line
4113,you can see how much water the sponge soaked up by um doing the answer you got minus the weight of the dry sponge,you can see how much water the sponge soaked up by um doing the answer you got minus the weight of the dry sponge
4114,it's going good thank you,it's going good thank you
4115,we were trying to figure out how much they weighed,we were trying to figure out how much they weigghed
4116,so these objects there's a dry sponge a wet s sponge and a soaked sponge and the dry sponge is the lightest then the wet sponge then the soaked sponge is the heaviest,so these objects there's a dry sponge a wet sa sponge and the soaked sponge and the dry sponge is the lightest then the wet sponge then the soaked sponge is the heaviest
4117,um a wet sponge is um soft is squishier and um it feels softer and yeah,um a wet sponge is um soft a squiushier and um it feels softer and yeah
4118,when you have a balance and a sponge you can um put the sponge in one side and put gram pieces on the other side to see how much it weighs,when you have a balance on a sponge you can um put the sponge in one side and put gram pieces on the other side to see how much it weighs
4119,i found out that the dry sponge when it when it's soaked absorbed like um like ten times its own weight,i found out that the dryy sponge when it went to soaked absorbed like um like ten times its own weight
4120,it's when it stops absorbing water,it's when it stops absorbing water
4121,you can use a balance to measure the weight and the mass of something,you can use the balance to masure the weight and the mass of something
4122,i figured out that the wet sponge was sixteen grams,i figured out that the wet sponge was sixteen grams
4123,i do not know,i do not know

4138,i measured my foot and the distance around my wrist i think it was cool because it w um because i it was just very cool,i measured my foot and the distance around my rist i think it was cool because it w um because i it was just very cool
4139,but my arm span and my heighth,the my eirm spand and my heith
4140,i measured from my wrist to my elbow,i measured from my rest omy elbow
4141,i don't know,i don't know
4142,you use a ruler or a meter stick or like something like that,you use a ruler or a meter stick or like something like that
4143,you would um have to measure it so you would get the right answer and be sure you know how like tall you are like measuring the heighth,you would um have to measure it so you would get the right answer and be sure you know how like tall you are sens wam like measuring the height
4144,you wou you could still use a meter stick but you would use the centimeters on it,you would you can still use a meter stick but you would use the centimeters on it
4145,you have to begin at a corner and end at a kind of corner otherwise you won't really have a quite accurate measurement,you have to be gin aut a corner and end at a kind of corner otherwise you won't really have a quite accureate measurement
4146,i forget i think,i forget i think
4147,when i figured out how long no tall my ear was it was really cool because it was the same length as my nose,when i figured out how long nope tall myht ear was it was really cool because it was the same length as my knose

4149,the person is measuring his pinkie and finding out that it is one centimeter wide,the person is measuring is pinkie and finding out that it is one centimeter wide
4150,you use centimeters to measure when something's not as long as a meter so you can find the right answer,we use centimeters to measure wen something's not as long as a meter so you can find the right answer
4151,l it fits in because if you know how wide your pinkie is then you can tell like objects with your pinkie so you know how um wide or tall they are,el if it's in because if you know how wide your pinkie is then you can count like objects with your pinkie so you'd know how um wide or tall they are
4152,you would use em when there's for the millimeters you wouldn't use it when it then when it's smaller than a centimeter and you would use centimeters when it's smaller than a decameter,you would use hem when there's for the millimeters you wouldn't use it when it then when it's smaller than a centimeter and you would  use centimeters when it's smaller than a decimeter
4153,um i don't know,um i don't know
4154,um you would you measured it twice because if you're like meter if you had a me meter measuring um tape then it will kind of go like,like it would just go bat it would be very rinkelly so you couldn't really get u quite precice answer
4155,yeah,yeah
4156,you could use a ruler and then like every rule most rulers are the same size so you would get a more accurate answer,you could use a ruler and then like every rule most rulers are the same size so you would get a more accurate answer
4157,it was about um to see how um how long it how wide it was and how long it was,it was about um to see how um  how long it how w wide it was an't how long it was
4158,lot of sense,alot of sense

4162,yes,yes
4163,it worked,it worked
4164,hi my name is nicky and i'm nine,hi my name is snickie and i'm nine
4165,you got uh a much different answer so it would be a really bad um strategy to use straws,you got  um much different answer so it would be a really bad um stratigy to use straws
4166,hi,hi
4167,it isn't a real good um strategy because um there's a lot of different sized straws in the world so it's really not a good strategy,it isn't a real good um stratagy because um there's a lot of different sized straws in the world so it's really not a good stratagy
4168,marty i have to go,already i have to go
4169,yeah,yeah
4170,uh when you use group a's and for the width it only take four straws and when you use group b's straws it takes um i think twelve,uh when you use group s amd for the width it only takes four straws and when you use group b straws it haags um i think twelve
4171,i used a straw and then i used um a measuring tape with um centimeters on it,i used a straw and then i used um a measuring tape with um centimeters on it
4172,yes,yes
4173,i would be trying to figure out how long that is the thing you asked me to measure is,i would be trying to figure out how long that is the thing you asked me to measure is
4174,because it's like a meter or something thing,because it's like a meter or somethingtin
4175,a yard stick,a yard stick
4176,um we then we read a book it was about how we think feet got to be,um we then we wread a book it was about how we think fee got to b
4177,yeah i did learn uh we had like this long thing with meter,yeah i didn't learn a m um we had like this long thing up with meter
4178,no we just uh the straws were just uneven,no we just uthe straws were just un even
4179,um we imagined pictures like it a light would be like a l kilometer um we imagined things that might be a kilometer,um we a magn pictures like if a light would be like a lo kilometer um we a ma a think that might be a kilometer
4180,uh mile is very long it's very big um would probably be about half a mile,uh uh  mile is very long it's very big uwould probably be about half a mile
4181,thousand a thousand wait um a hundred,solvet ixe seven it um a hundred
4182,right there uh huh,right there  h
4183,that means you would start using feet um or centimeters or any other,that mayyou  start you the feet um or centimeters o  m
4184,well i learned that um part of it is a centimeter,well i learned that um part of it is a centimeter
4185,like there would be one straw that was this long and then another straw that was this long,like there'ld be one straw that was this longer than another straw of e this long
4186,um the least amount would be a meter,um the least amount would be a meter
4187,it has a thousand in a millimeter i mean wait a millimeter there's a thousand m um millimeters in a meter,and of te southand and a millimeter u  it's a millimeter theea shousand  um millimeters in a meter
4188,um they're centimeters and they're very small they are like the length of a bug um they're but there is something smaller than a centimeter,um they're centimeters and they're very small they re like the lengs of a bug um they're but there is something smaller than a centimeter
4189,but my desk is like way back there so,but my desk wild like pay back there to o  really mean it
4190,um no,um no
4191,um he's three feet long,um he's three feet long
4192,um because straws are uneven and a meter is a um a good way because it's even it's always even,um because strawter and even and a meter is a um a good way because it's even it's always even
4193,thousand,solvend
4194,um you could measure a bug,um you can measure a book
4195,hi,hi
4196,yeah cause we learned that,yeah cause we learned that
4197,a y a yard stick a meter,a  a yard stick a meter
4198,well we would use them so that if you hike you would know how far you would need to go or how long you have hiked,well we would use them so that if you hike you would know how far o woud need to go or how  long you'll have height
4199,uh the tip of a pencil um how skin skinny a pencil is,uh the tip of a pencim um i skin skin a pencil is
4200,you would,you
4201,um a hundred,uh um a hundred
4202,it is a millimeter,it is a millimeter
4203,but they could be uneven straws,but they could be un even straws
4204,well when we we kinda like felt it and we i think it was like the same except yeah,well when we w kindaf like felte and we i think it was like the same except yeah
4205,um grams wa and water oh yeah li yeah,um grams water and water oh yeah yeah
4206,um we used the metric system,um wel use he metric system
4207,spongebob squarepants,sponge out ra ans
4208,hi,hi
4209,then it went like that and then it kinda went up,then it went lik that and then it kindaf went up
4210,well um when you actually measured them we found out that we were right oh,well um  when you actually measured them we found out that we were right uh e did

4217,yeah,yeah
4218,um that's a thermometer and i'm guessing it uses celsius,um that's a thermometer and an justing yo uses celsius
4219,well i know that we now we i know we that in u s a we don't use it um,well i know that we  now wa i know we that in the oth stay we don't use it um
4220,well actually they were saying um a and c were the same and then b was cold,welat they're the same um a and c were the same d than b was cold
4221,um i think so,um i think sthough
4222,well we thought that it was re we thought it was warm and then we got really cold really cold then it just started to warm up,well we thought that it was rea we wa ta sougt it was warm and it an wit got really cold and wat cold then it started warm up
4223,hello hi,hello hi
4224,um it freezes,um it freezes
4225,um kinda,um killiter
4226,yeah,yeah
4227,um a balance,um a balance
4228,not really,at really
4229,well we ended it,wll we ended it
4230,yeah i'd like to,yeah i like tou
4231,um i've liked how we got to d use the thermometer the first one to use it,um i'v liked how we got to use a thermometer it didn't we like the first one to use it
4232,well yeah um the important thing about that is if you don't use the same you don't get an accurate thing,well yehave um thhe pornt thing about that is if you don't use the same you don't get en accurate saing
4233,it burn boiled,it wur boiled
4234,yep,yup
4235,yeah,yeah
4236,um he's using his finger mmm hmm,well he've using his finger mm hm
4237,yeah,yeah
4238,yeah like cold,yeah like cold
4239,um weighing the apples,um weighing the apples
4240,what,what
4241,you would put the container of water in one and then in the other one you'd put how many grams or if y what measurement you're using,you would put the container of water in one and then in the other one yo would put houw many grams e re if you what measure m met you're guising
4242,um grams,um grams
4243,um we had like little bags and we put sand in there so we ha each group had each team had two bags and then we put them into a giant bag and,um we had like little bags and we put the en in there so we had each group had each teeam had two bags and then we put them into a giant bag and
4244,um oh grams,um uh grams
4245,we knew it,or the we knew
4246,well hmm,well
4247,yes we know that um it's a wet sponge because of the size that would mean that this much grams equals a wet sponge,yes we know that um it's a wet sponge because of he fli's that would mean that this much gram's equals a wet sponge
4248,well this i we know that's that's a wet s sponge from let's see where is that picture,well this is we know that' that's a wet sponge from see where is that picture
4249,uh hi cool,uh i uah uh
4250,um we did measurement today um,um we did measure int today um
4251,n mmm,
4252,um so what we did first was we got like everything we need and like the balance and the mass pieces um mass pieces,um so what we did first was we got like everything we needed like the balance and the mass pieces um mass pieces
4253,grams eighty three grams,grams eighte grams
4254,um it's about h how much you think it is the closest you think it will be,uh um it's about  how much you think it is the closest you think it will be
4255,yes before we me um estimated the weight of the sponge um the dry sponge we estimated,yes before we met um estimated the weight of the sponge um the dry sponge we estimated
4256,yeah we knew that the spon the dry sponge was two grams so we minus two grams from eighty five and we got eighty three,yeah we knew that the sponge the dry sponge was two grams so we minus two grams from eighty five and we got eighty three
4257,oh i don't really remember,oh i don't really remember
4258,well we knew it i know it's not a kilometer cause that's in me like um,well we knew it i know it's not a kilometer cause that's a mi like hum
4259,yeah gram gram piece like,yeah gram gram piece like
4260,yup,yup
4261,um well we our teacher um did that but i think it's still drying out think so,um well we d our teacher um did that but i think it's till drying out  six co
4262,we did um weighing how much sponge ca e um water can take up,we did um learning how much sponge ca um um water can take up
4263,dry sponge,dry sponge
4264,um a kilogram,um a kilogram
4265,good,good
4266,um sometimes but usually not really,um sometimes but usually not really
4267,um i haven't learned that yet hmm i think that was it,uh um i haven't learned that yet hm i think that was it
4268,wa water,w water
4269,we weren't here,we weren't heare
4270,um this side,um this side
4271,the more i'm guessing the more water it has the bigger it is,the more i'm guessing the more water it has the igr it is
4272,i don't know,i don't know
4273,um it was squishy we didn't really feel it though yeah i didn't really feel,um it was squishy we didn't really feel though yeah i did'treally feel
4274,um well when put it in the water we saw it like a giant but when you took it out it was smaller,um well when we put it in the water we saw it like a gianth but when you took it ou tit was somall wer
4275,yeah,yea
4276,what,what
4277,i haven't done that i don't know yet,i'ven't lorne that i don't know yet
4278,um it's keeping all the water in there until you can squeeze it out,um it's keeping all the water in there until you can squeeze it out
4279,what,what
4280,so that in case you accidentally dropped it you it wouldn't be good m explosion,so that in case you actually dropped it you it wouldn't make at  explosion
4281,bye,bye
4282,um stan a standard unit when you use liquids would be water or like the kinda liquid that you're using,um s a standard unit when you use liquids would be water or like the kind of liquid yet you're using
4283,the vile,the vial
4284,yeah like you could like um use like take the smaller and put it somewhere else and like take turns using it,yeah like you could like um you like take tho smaller and put it o somewhere else and like take turms using it
4285,i think this one is,i think thi's one is
4286,like pour it and then see how many milliliters it is,like pour it and then s how many milliliters it is
4287,well because it's higher and it kinda looks like like it was then and it like it looks like then and like looks the same,well because it's higher and it kind af loks like like theres thatn and uke it looks like that it loiokes looks the same
4288,of something it's like a k like a think like that looks like kinda like this,oh something it's like ok like a thing like that looks like kind a like this
4289,well,well
4290,and this these two things,and this these two things
4291,well you look at it and like go like this with your hands and then like,well you cd the look at it and like go like this with your hands and then like
4292,guess what um estimating would be,yuess we um estimating would be
4293,no,no
4294,estimates are basically about guessing,estimantes are eally basically about guessing
4295,uh well you could do the cup and like could have,uh well you could use the cup and like a cut
4296,i know,i kno
4297,because if you don't want the same one you're not accurate,because if you don't whant the same one you're not accurate
4298,uh no we didn't it was not um we didn't do it with f we didn't it wasn't full we just poured water and was like empty,um no we didn't it was not um we didn't do it with f we didn't it wasn't full wut just poured water wit like energy
4299,um we fi we figured out we went like this and this and then we did all of it well we went to a and then class b like went like we would take the thing and pour in more and more,um we fi we figured it out we went like this hen this then we did all of it well we went to a and in e class bee like went like we would take the thing and pouer and more and more
4300,well uh well milliliters are um a liter is i think a thousand milliliters and milliliters are li like a drop,well ah well milliliters are um a liter the i think a thousand milliliters and milliliters are live like a drop
4301,um you could use um this,um you could use um this
4302,um i don't know,um i don't know
4303,um well we figured out that it we that the soda company the um people who made these w w left a little space because um because uh,um well we figured out that it wa t a soda coumponny the um people whou made these w w left a little space because um because uh
4304,i think graduated cylinder,i think graduated cylinder
4305,well then you know that it's well then if you pour and it gets all the way up there and then you still have extra you could pour it into a one liter beaker and then pour the rest into here,well then you know that it's well then if you pour it and get's all the way up there and then you stall of xtra you could pour it into a one liter beaker and then pour the rest into here
4306,um es measure stuff smaller than a liter,um s measure stuff smaller than a liter
4307,yeah,yeah
4308,you could like,you could like
4309,well like for the one the graduated cylinder measure the volume you could like pour like this cup into there and see how much it is,well like for the one the graduated cylinder to measure the volume you could like pour like this cup into there and see how much it is
4310,um you would probably think twice of how much it would be,um you would probably think twice of how much it would be
4311,um that they were like we weren't accurate and we weren't using a good amount,um that they weren like we weren't accurate and we weren't you think a good amount
4312,water milliliters liters um,water milliters liters um
4313,yeah and then like see if it goes like to the fifty or um twenty line and then you would know that it had like a hundred and twenty,yeah and then like ch fugl tick to the fift or um twenty line and then you know that it like a hundred and twenty
4314,hello,hello
4315,estimate,estimate
4316,hi h hi bye,i hi hi bie
4317,well you could you like pole that's kinda like this and,well you could use a lung like pulle that's kinda like this and
4318,um it was k um meters,um it wast c um meters
4319,thank you,thank you
4320,it's all about one gram one gram equals just about one t p tiny particle of each tw thing we have here,it's all about one gram one gram equals just about oncs p tiny particle of each tthing we have here

4461,to help it grow because like it has to have fresh air nice cool water and sunlight to to grow,tt help it grow bcause like yi has to have fresh air nice cool water and sunlight to grow
4462,well it has everything it has a water the air the sunlight and everything it needs to grow and look,well it has everything it has a water the air the sunlight everything it needs to grow and look
4463,it needs sunlight to grow because if it doesn't have any sunlight it just flops,it needs sunlight to grow ecause if it doesn't have any sunlight it just flops up
4464,well it just needs water oxygen carbon dioxide sunlight and yeah that's about it to survive,well it just needs water oxygen carbon dioxide sunlights and at's about it type survive
4465,well it looks a little better but it still needs water to grow because like that's the main thing that it needs it needs the water to get it all like all like woo awake so it can grow more,well it looks little better but it still needs water to grow cause like that's the meain thing that it needs it needs the water to get it like a like o awake so it can grow more
4466,because it has all the sunlight it need all the air it needs and all the water it needs,because it has all the sunlight it needs all the air it needs and all the water it needs
4467,make their own food because uhm i can't remember what it's called the sugar like the sugar leaves the stuff in the plant to for it to grow,makes their own food cause i can't remember what i ing with sugar like the sugar feeds the stuff and the plant shuk for it to grow
4468,uh not sure,notsure
4469,there's no air so that just makes it worse it's probably just going to die right away,there's no air so that just makes it works probably just gongna die right away
4470,uhm the one in the light bag that we did turned all green and all perfect and uhm the one in the dark back turned all yellow and it didn't have as much grown,the one in the light bag that we did turned all green and all perfect and  the one in the dark bag turned ot like all yellow ind it didn't have as much grown

4479,not learned because you're not just taught you're just not taught like you're just oh it's time to come out now they just they just come out whenever they want to come out,non learned because ou're no o you'rein just not tap like you just like all wast time to come out now they just they just come out whenever they want to come out
4480,the grass the trees the water rocks dirt leaves lot of the leaves lots of water you know,the grass the trees the water rocks dirt leaves lots of leaves lots of water and te
4481,i am good i know why i guess so,i'm good and a way i guess i don't
4482,it depends because sometimes it just an instinctive but sometimes they have to be taught,it depends ecause sometimes it just the newinstinct thing but sometimes they have to be taught
4483,i think there's a little is a a learned behavior,i think this  little is a a learned behavior
4484,it's his adaptation,it's his adaptation

4492,i don't know what you mean,i don't know what you mean
4493,well they like work together to make a system i think,well they like work together to make a system i think
4494,i think it makes it a system but i the way what was i think i i don't know i've not very sure about that,i think it makes it a system buy the b mthe way it moves i think i i don't know i'm not very sure about that
4495,i don't know,i don't know
4496,the eyes the heart and the organs,the eyes the heart and the organs
4497,i think i think it has to do with systems is because that there's a lot of things that can move like a human body a suitcase car the earth i don't know i'm not very sure,i think i think it has to do isystems is because that there's a lot of things that can move like a human body a suitcase car the earth i don't know'm not very short

4500,we've been learning about producers consumers and consumers,we've been learning about producers deconsumers and consumers
4501,because they can move i think i'm not very sure,because you can move i think i'm not very sore
4502,i think they're like the same because they have to do with something like living things and the earth and trees and water and stuff and fish,mi think they're like the same because m they have to do it with something like living things and the earth and trees and water and stuff and fish
4503,i see water houses trees coral and i think that's a mountain,i see water houses trees coral and i think that's a mountain
4504,i don't know,i don't know
4505,i'm not sure what they're called i think there is i think there's five or like ten or something i don't know,i'm not sure what they're called and i think there is i think theyre's fine or like ten or something i don't know
4506,sorry what,sorry what

4510,so you can measure stuff without a ruler,so you can measure stuff without a ruler
4511,yep,yup
4512,da uh we had different answers we had groups and then we had different answers and tha and that was because mister froller had changed the size of the straws,the uh we had different answers we had groups and then we had different answers and that and that was because mister purler hoald change the size sof the straws
4513,yeah i just started this week,yeah it just start this week
4514,yeah,yeah
4515,i would change,i would change
4516,that some of them can be shorter and longer and that takes different measurements mmm hmm yeah,that some of them can be shorter and longer and that takes different measurements  hm yeah
4517,that w ten centimeters would be half from my wrist to my elbow,thout ten centimeters would be half from my rist to my elbow
4518,yeah and then we made our own meter sticks that has centimeters and decameters it but it doesn't have inches,yeah and then we made our own meter sticks that has centimeters and decimeters it but it doesn't have inches
4519,not exactly,not exactly
4520,uh i forgot,uh i forgot
4521,yeah cause sometimes you don't bring a ruler to where you're going and then you need to show where it is,yeah cause sometimes you don't bring a ruler to where you're going and then you need to show where ithis
4522,yeah,yeah
4523,that's about from the back of this chair to olivia back there,that's about from the back of this chair to alivia back there
4524,yeah that means that it's ten straws across from me and then three straws this way,yeah that means that it's ten straws acrass from me and then three straws this way
4525,no,no
4526,we measured our desks in straws,we measured our desks and straws
4527,well that they are that they sometimes do wrong measurements cause they get bent and stuff and then that shrinks em a little bit,well that they are that they sometimes do wrong measurements cause they get bent iand stuff and then that shrinks om a little bit
4528,that t the dry sponge is two grams the wet sponge is sixteen grams and the water wa so the water was fourteen grams,that to the dry sponge is two grams the wet sponge is sixteen grams and the water w so the water was fourteen grams
4529,t for scrubbing for scrubbing because you can get a lot of water in it and then when you push down the water comes out and then you can do the same thing to put soap in it,for scrapping for scrapping because you can get a lot of water in it and then when you push down the water comes out sand then you can do the same thing to put soape in it
4530,it's weighing it and the sponge is there and it's heavier than thin air,it's weighing it and the sponge is there and its heavier than thin air

4535,like yesterday we weighed like pencils and other stuff,like yesterday we weighed like pencils an other stuff
4536,um it weighs sixteen grams mmm hmm,um that wat is sixteen grams m hm
4537,it has two grams in there and then it has a sponge on the other side and it's exactly equal,it has two grams in there and then it has a sponge on the other side and it's exactly equal
4538,from here i subtracted two to sixteen and that's fourteen s so that's how much the water was,from here i subdacted two to sixteen and that's fourteen sso that's how much the water was

4586,they might have been um different cups and they might not have been equally um made and uh cut levelly,they might have been um different cups and they might not have been equally um made and uh cut levely
4587,um it was uh like it was actually the water that we um took out of the things and then put them in this container that showed milliliters and that's how we got our results,um it was uh like it was actually the water that we um took out of the things and then put them in this container that showed milliliters and that's how we got our results
4588,um i was amazed to see that when we put the passengers in um um just a little cup of you put a circle around it and even the balance then it may it you could get a lot of passengers in there,um i was ama to see that when we put the passengers in um uh just a little cup if you put a circle around it and even the balance then it ma it you could get a lot of passengers in there
4589,we made two boats that were three centimeters long,we need twwo boats that were three centimeters long
4590,by um doing them um correctly and orderly and uh slowly so that you can get uh accurate data,by um doing them uh correctly and orderly and uh slowly so that you can get uh accurate dat of
4591,um i had another day in science and uh we worked on boats and um we uh had variables and other like things and it was in like a little tub,um i had another day in science and ul we worked on boats and um we uh had variables and other like things ant it was in it like a little tub
4592,well when we measured them we made sure that they were each uh different um height and yeah,well when we measured them we made sure that they were each ah different um height and yeah
4593,good,good
4594,you could may be add more pennies or take away the penny and add something um different like a different object to it,you coauld maybe add more pennies or take away the penny and tan it's something um different like a different object to it
4595,you have to pick it up and then let it swing and when it goes back and forth and like,you have to pick it up and then let it swing and when it goes back and forth and like
4596,that with the higher swings um the um in fifteen seconds it did um it had more cycles,that with the higher swings um the um in fifteen seconds it did um it had more cycles
4597,when you put it at the top it starts but gradually it'll start to um decrease um in how high it goes cause there's not enough force and the weight is weighing it down,when you put it at the top it starts but gradually it'll start to um dcrease um and how high it goes cause there's not enough force and the weight is weighing it down
4598,well when it swings back and forth the weight would cause it to sink lower and not go as high when it comes back around and completes the cycle,well when it swings back and forth the weight would cause it to sink lower and not go as high when it comes back around and completes the cycles
4599,it means that it's a certain thing in an experiment that you could change or keep the same and it's part of the experiment,it means that it's a certain thing an an experiment that you could change or keep the same and it's part of the experiment
4600,well there is more um there is one on one and then like it goes in the number of how many there are and i think well well of course it will it would cause more weight,well there is more um there's one on one and then like it goes in the number of how many there are end i think that well of course it wils it would cause more weight
4601,when i click the bob goes to where i clicked,when i click the bob goes to where i clicked
4602,what's the table for,what's a tableg
4603,the cycle is when it goes back and back and then back again to where it used to be,the cycle is when it goes back and back and then back again to where it use to be
4604,yes,yes
4605,yes,yes
4606,uh at the end of the string there is its weight and it will keep the string moving,uh at the end of the string there's it's weight and it will keep the string moving
4607,well since it's at the end of the string it will cause the string not to go flimsy and around,well since it's at the end of the string it will cause the string not to go frimziing around
4608,it goes down and up and then down and up again to uh the place where it was but it's still lower than,it goes down and up and then down and up agaain to uh the place where it was but it's still lower the
4609,i may put um something that's not a penny and may be it would cause more weight,i might put um something that's not a penny and maybe it would cause more weight
4610,may be if you um had a bigger pencil to hang it from then um it might uh affect may be how high it goes,maybe if you um had a bigger pencil to hang it from then um it might ueffect maybe how high it goes
4611,when i did it two times uh i realized that the cycles were the same both times,one hi did it two times uh i reallized that the cycles were the same both times
4612,you can see how many times it will s make a cycle um in fifteen seconds,you can see how many times it will uh smake a cycle um ififteen seconds
4613,you can collect it on a data file,you can collect it on a data fiale
4614,that would depend on what kind of variables they were and what they were changing,that would depend on what kind of variables they were and what they were changing

4620,bye,bye
4621,yes because um because they only changed one variable from the longer uh string,yes because um because they only changed one variable from the longer a string

5357,the top ones on showing the same pathway the electricity,the top ones aren't showing the same pathway but electricity
5358,well it's coming out of the side and going back into their d cell,well it's coming out of the side and going back into the d cell
5359,it has it's own pathway,it has its own pathway
5360,the top ones,the top ones
5361,that those showing the same flow,that they're showing the same flow
5362,well the bottom is the both the the top ones by but the bottom line is a pathway the top ones have though own pathway,well the bottom is really dim the both the the top ones are light but the bottom one is showing a pathway the top one the top ones have their own pathway
5363,up one because the more brighter so you can see better,up ones because them are brighter so you can you can see mettal
5364,well some show the same the pathway and some don't but if they show the same pathway they won't be asked bright,well some show the same pathway and some don't but if they show the same pathway they won't be as bright
5365,well the silly circuit it would the light bulb should would be dim but in a that was so good the light bulbs would be light,well the silly circuit it would the light bulbs would be dim but in a ppalallel circuit the light bulbs would be light
5366,they both are using the same pathway,they both all using the same pathway
5367,it's flowing and from the bottom of the lighht bulb,it's flowing in from the bottom of the of thelight bulb
5368,that the top one is showing that it's not showing a pathway in the bottom one that showing a pathway then top one is bright and the one is dim,that the top one is showing is not showing te pathway and the bottom one is showing a pathway and t top one is bright and the bottom one one is dim
5369,well it's showing energy from a light bulb from the other light bulb,well it's it's showing energy from the light bulb from the other light bulb
5370,well it's a going out of that the negative side going into both the batteries and then coming back into the d cell,well it's going out of the negative side going into both the batteries and then coming back into the d cell
5371,ah umm the top two they would be the best,the the top tub they would be the best
5372,they both are using the same pathway,they both a they both are using the same pathway
5373,well it's showing the same it's showing the same the same pathway so though not going to get much electricity into them,well it's showing the same it's showing the same pathway so they're not gonna get as much as electricity into them
5374,well the tube light bulbs were showing the same pathway of energy and they won't be as bright that by it,well the two light bulbs are showing the same pathway of energy and they won't be as bright that way
5375,well the top ones are bright the bottom one is not so bright and but like the bottom one is showing a pathway what just to it the top ones out,well the top ones are bright the bottom one is not so bright and but like the bottom one is showing ha pathway wherelectricity the top ones oltd
5376,well the flow they should the same flow so they repels was going to be as light,well the flow they show the same flow so the light bulbs arn going nta be as light
5377,the series circuits impel good,they're sillies circuits and pplel circuits
5378,energy,energy
5379,bye mornie,bye marnie
5380,they give the light bulb energy,they give the light bulb energy
5381,the negative side,the negative side
5382,it lights up,it lights up
5383,electricity,electricity
5384,it takes the it takes the energy all though electricity from the battery in it ended though and it like mix the light bulb light,it takes the it takes the energy o the electricity from the battery and it and the and it like makes the light bulb light
5385,it gives the energy to the light bulb,it gives it gives the energy to the light bulb
5386,it wouldn't give it any electricity because though can be any going out into the positive side of the d cell,it wouldn't give it any electricity because there cauldn't be any going out into the positive side of the d cell
5387,they light up if it has a source of energy,they they light up if it has a source of energy
5388,the negative,the negative
5389,a battery wires and then light bulb,a battery wires and a light bulb
5390,that the d cell gives like if wires are connected to it and the wires are connected to the light bulb it gives it like energy to make the light bulb light,that the d cell gives like if the wires are connected to it and the wires are connected to the light bulb it gives it  like energys to make the light bulb light
5391,if though connected to the d cell they transfer the energy to the light bulb,if they're connected to the d cell they chrangefer the energy to the light bulb
5392,the power comes from the negative and it goes to the light bulb and comes through the positive,the the power comes from the negative and it goes through the light bulb and comes through the positive
5393,a battery,a battery
5394,it goes toward with the side of the light bulb and it goes up to the filament and it goes down it goes keep going forward then it goes to the positive side,it goes toards the side of the light bulb and it goes up to the filament and it goes d it goes it goes keeps going foard and it then it goes to the positive side
5395,it's the source that gives us the light bulb energy,it's the source that gives the light bulb energy
5396,energy,energy
5397,both of the wire those one wire going from the bottom and those one wire going from the side,b both of the i there's one wire going from the bottom and there's one wire going from the side
5398,how do make a light bulb light,how to make a light bulb light
5399,the battery turned and now its going the opposite way and like its going into different direction all in though the light bulb is still lighting,the battery turned and now it's going the opposite way  and like it's going in different direction now ind the the light bulb is still lighting
5400,good,good
5401,the d cell is giving the light bulb energy through the wires,the d cell is giving the the light bulb  energy through the wires
5402,the light bulb now lead up want to changes to the side,the light bulb now lit up when i changed it to the side
5403,it means that it will recieves but it will recieves the energy from the d cell,it means that it receives the  it receives the energy from the d cell
5404,okay,okay
5405,it moves the opposite way,it moves the opposite way
5406,yup,yup
5407,its flowing all in one direction to the light because the positive side is going through the battery into the negative side,it's flowing all in one direction to the light because because it the pusthe positive side is going through the battery into ta negative side
5408,it's to the left and like center to the left and so it connected to the metal pole it won't the motor won't move so that means the switch is making it off,it's it's to the left and like since its to the left and it's not connected to the metal pulb it won't the motor won't move so that means the switch is making it off
5409,the motor is moving,the motor is moving
5410,the solar panel was giving it electricity to d cell can move,the solar panels giving it electricity so it can move
5411,its sunny all in the solar panel is giving the electricty to the motor,it's un and the solar panel is giving electricity to the motor
5412,it doesn't move,it doesn't move
5413,it doesn't give electricity to get it doesn't give electricity,it doesn't give it electricity to get to it doesn't give it electricity
5414,the motor starts moving,the motor starts moving
5415,that is that its off i think it means that is off,that it's that thet's that' it's off i think it means that it's off
5416,makes the motor move,makes the motor move
5417,the motor starts running,the motor starts running
5418,no i do not,no i do not
5419,they the sun come if the sun is shining on them it gives the electricity to all those things,they the sun come if the sun is shining on it it gives electricityty to other things
5420,we have been learning about motors and wires and when they connect the motor moves and we think,we've been learning learning about motors and wires and when they connect the motor moves and everything
5421,now the electricity goes into the motor because it's not travelling through the metal and it is make the motor run,no  electricity goes into the motor because i not traveling through the metal and it doesn't make the motor run
5422,it gives the solar panel electricity to give it to the motor so it moves so the motor runs and moves,it gives a solar panels electricity to give it to the motor so it moves so the motor runs and moves
5423,the motor is working,the motor is working
5424,bye mornie,bye marnie
5425,open,open
5426,the flag is moving and its important because that means the motor is working and its moving,the flag is moving and it's important because that means the motor is working and it's moving
5427,the switch needs to be closed,the switch needs to be closed
5428,those two wires connected to the part even negative side of the d cell and its making the motor moves,those two wires connected to the positive and negative side of the d cell and its making the motor move
5429,that it turns to the sun shine untill that just being gives the electricity to all those things,that it turns the sun shine into electricity nd gives the electricity to other things
5430,i will no electricity would come through it because at there was no sun on it make a interval electricity,it no electricity would come through it because it gows no sun on it to make it into electricity
5431,its in the close position,it's in the closed position
5432,those are electricity going into it,those electricity going into it
5433,the track giving the electricity to move,it's not giving it electricity to move
5434,so that ended the positive side of the d cell that while is going through the metal connecting to the other side of the wire is going to the motor and that's giving the power,so that in the positive side f the d cell that wire is going through the metal connecting to the other side of the wire and it's going to the motor and that's giving at power
5435,the motor starts moving,the motor starts moving
5436,it showing that the d cell is giving the motor electricity so the motor moves,it's showing that the d cell is giving the moto electricity so the motor moves
5437,the motor starts moving,the motor starts moving
5438,the solar panel has to get sunshine,the soalar panel has to get sunshine
5439,magnet,brnd
5440,the switch has to be on,the switch has to be o
5441,the flag moves,the flag moves
5442,well if sun is sharing the cell then its working but when it goes off there is no work and the flag will,wheln the sun is hitting the sun then it it working but when it goes of then it win't work and the flag wil
5443,the electricity will go through the d cell and it will turn on the flag,the electricity won't go through the d cell and it will't turn of the flags
5444,the d cells electricity makes the flag move,producers electricity makes the flag
5445,the electricity goes through the wires and until it's cell and then it goes interact when will contraction and then it makes the flag move,the electricity goes through the wires and into the the cell and then it goes into that little cttraction and then it makes the flag move
5446,it makes the flag move,it makes the flag move
5447,no nail,no
5448,and electricity go through the two wires to make a flag move because the flag is metal on both sides so the metal touches that it turns on make through electricity,its electricity won through the two wires to make the flow moove because the flag isn't metal on both sides so when te metal touches it it turns on o makes electricity
5449,the cell has behind the sun and then the wires connect all the way to the contraction and then make reflective so electricity goes through the few thing over and over and over,the cell has to be hating the sun and then the wires connect all the way to thet attraction and then makes the flag move so electricity goes through the buld thing over and over and over
5450,it's on the metal where the wire is so it doesn't count all the way but it goes on like so there just it is electricity pass there so they was on top what a pretty as much electricity,it's on the metal where the wire is so it doesn't co all the way but it goes on like palthway so teetricit electricity faster so if it was on top enit wouldn't prett elect electricity
5451,the electricity going through,that electricity's can go through
5452,because they didn't then it what if work as well as a it's down so while we its dark anything outside will not work,because fit didn't then it wouldn't work and  will as it is now so when  it's dark and it's outside will not work
5453,it's not going to till because the switches off and it's not creating a circuit to make the flag move,it's not gongno go through because the switch is off and it's no e creat of the circuit to make the flayer mave
5454,no,we
5455,it's not touching metal so where electricity won't go to the flag and it will make a circuit,it's not touching metal so we electricity won't go to the flag and it won't make a circuit
5456,because the d cell has electricity in it so when then two connecters connect to the metal find on both sides as the switch touches metal then it will start working and create and put it would electricity to the flag,cause the d cell has electricity in it so when the two connectors connect to the metal flag on both sides and the switch touches metal hen it will start working and create and produ electricity to the flag
5457,the d cell is at a circuit,the d cell is it a circuit thettni cell
5458,those are also that electricity so when you put two wires on they and put a set to a d cell and putting into sun then vibrating to be like that electricity going through that cell,those are also about the electricity so when you put two wires on it add pre itto a d cell and put it in the sun ten it i a vibrating make a su skup that's e electricity going through that
5459,it has to be on the metal,it has to be on the metal
5460,we've has been creating circuit,we've been creating a circuit
5461,then it doesn't work,that it did't work
5462,that when i touch it it moves and then i touch it again it moves off the circuit so it will produce the electricity but won't does touch the metal and produces electricity,that when i touch it it moves and then when i touch it again it moves off if the circuit so it wil produce the electricity when it does touch the e it produces electricity
5463,because when the wire fix the d cell and other electricity doesn't like contracted like they contracted too,cause when  the wire it's the d cell a of electricityy nowes  theation makes the tchi work
5464,the flag moves,the flag moves
5465,it wouldn't work because that's be semi and mike has been getting it,it wouldn't work because it has to be sunny and  light has tobe hinn
5466,electricity is going through it to make it move,electricity is going through it to make it mo
5467,the d cell and the electricity,the d cell and the electricity
5468,the d cell has to be attracted two wires to go through the electricity to get to the move,cell has to be axiet to c wires to go ih  to goth o the electricity to get o te o
5469,the flag stops moving because it does the sunlight and it is have electricity between the wires,the flag stops mt bin because it it doesn't have lights and it doesn't heavy electricity which weign te
5470,no metal is put touching those two wires and like that and connect still just ready to get the,ell metal is touching to the irn so it ca it  connet electricity to get the roin
5471,i talk to you later bye,i'll talk to you later bye
5472,you're separate no and there its it's like we better so yeah,yus ave put a nail in there it's it's like way better so yeah
5473,i don't know,i don't know
5474,its flowing through electricity,it's flowing through electricity
5475,electricity is going through it okay,electricity is going through it okay
5476,and finnaly met before,i'm fine we've met before
5477,we've been learning science you can talking to me about it,we've been learning science ever since you've been talking to me about it
5478,your down,you're dung
5479,because there not metal like all the other once,cause they're not metal like all the other ones
5480,it works because it's a metal,it works cause it's metal
5481,we seen each other before,we've seen each other before
5482,just draw the tape the spiral that rock in stuff are all insulators but a other stuff is conductors,the straw the tape the sponge the rock and stuff are all insulators but all the other stuff is conductors
5483,one the metal is touching the switch so i already know that,touching this one the metal is touching the switch soyeah
5484,the nail,the nail
5485,metal is something if something's metal then and it sticks to something all sides metal then it would work and it would complete conductor,metal is something if something's  metal then n it sticks to something else that s metal then it would work and it would complete a conductor
5486,because the switch is metal so that's metal so it's make in a work,cause the switch is metal so that's metal so it's making it work
5487,insulators are some stuff that's not metal but conductors are things are metal that makes just sitting,insulators are some stuff that's not metal but conductors or things that are metal that makes thelectricity
5488,it's not going because if that's not metal then work,it's not going because if that's not metal then it won't work
5489,i don't know can you repeat that please,i don't know can you repeat that please
5490,electricity is going to through the nail,electricity is going through with a nail
5491,its open,it's open
5492,all the objects will not make electricity go,all the objects will not make electricity go
5493,yeah i'm good how are you i know you we met before but no i don't want to meet you,yeah i'm good how are you i know we've meant before but kno i don't want to meet you
5494,because the switches off and it's creating a circuit electricity all away to that motor,cause the switch is off and it's creating a circuit and electricity all the way to that nertating motor
5495,the flag is been moving because the d cell has to be,the flag is t moving because the d cell has to be hooked up to the switch
5496,when i click the switch and it goes on the metal it works and goes to the motor circuit it create electricity over that it is on it won't work,when i clickd the switch and it goes on the metal it works and goes to the motor so it cant create electricity but whenn it is on it won't work
5497,the cell is hitting the motor so when the cell hits the motor the wires it always to that cell and that it's start working,the sun is hitting the motor so when the sun hits the motor the wires hit all the way to the cell and then it just starts working
5498,it will stop working because it's not creating electricity,it will stop working because it's lot creating electricity
5499,it is having the electricity going to the motor make a flag move,iis having electricity going to the motor and making a flag move
5500,it doesn't work,it doesn't work
5501,it works,it works
5502,it doesn't work,it doesn't work
5503,we've been learning about circuits,we've been learning about circuits
5504,because if it doesn't have if the sun has to hit that little contraction there then it will work,because if it doesn't hit if the sun doesn't hit that little contracting there then it won't work
5505,when you click on the cell its starts working will a stops working,when it when you click on the sun it starts working but when it's a cloudy day  stops working
5506,let the switch has to be off,l the switch has to be off
5507,the d cell is put does the electricity all away to the motor and making the flag move,the d cell is producing electricity all of the way to the motor and making the flag move
5508,no,no
5509,and till,you too
5510,the cell is hitting the motor and the motor set up the two wires all the way to the cell so while though that cell does hitting it it starts working,the sun is hitting the motor and the motor tuked up the two wires all the way to the cell so when thesun is hitting it it it starts working
5511,what,what
5512,it doesn't work,it doesn't work
5513,the flag moves,the flag moves
5514,it doesn't work,it doesn't work
5515,electricity,ectricity
5516,that put does the electricity,they're producing electrict
5517,it's creating a circuit that makes the motor run and makes the flag move,it's creating a second that makes the motor run and makes the flag move
5518,that it runs when the flag moves because the cell is gain electricity from the sun that two wires are hitting the motor so was the two wires make electricity to the motor then the flag move,that it runs an the flag moves because the cell is getting electricity from the sun the two wires are hitting the motor so when when the two wires making electricity to the motor then the flag moves
5519,that it's off the d cell it's off this the metal so it won't move the flag,that it's off the d cell is off the the metal so it won't move the flag
5520,it makes it work,it makes it work
5521,it would because it's not really sunny,it wouldn't work bcause it's not really sunny
5522,okay,okay
5523,the cell has to be hitting it,the sun has to be hitting it
5524,good,good
5525,they make electricity go through,they make electricity go through
5526,it wouldn't work,it wouldn't work
5527,now its going the opposite way but its going same way but if was turned around they would be go in the opposite way,now it's going the opposite way but it's still going the same way but if it was turne around it wou'ld be going the oppositeway
5528,its going the different way its going like then positive side go in the negative side going these way so its going to the positive and negative side but even light bulb is must be one to the that's i but anyway its going the other,it's going the different way it's going like then positive sides  goin d the negative sides going this way so it's going through the positiv to the negative side but even thogh the light bulb its must be going through that side but any way it's going the other
5529,light,light
5530,okay,okay
5531,than it would work because if it was just at the ba are the two bases of bulb around lights must go up the light bulb so i were work easier,then it wouldn't work because if it was just at the ba athe two bases of the bulb then nt wouldn't work bcause the wires pust go up the light bulb so it wi work easier
5532,the two wires are connected to the negative and positvie side and then the negative goes to the side of the metal of light bulb and then positve side goes up in light bulbs are produces the electricity through the light bulb,the two wires are connected to the negative and positive side and then the the negative goes to the side of the middle of the light bulb and then the positive side goes up in the light bulb so it produces the electricity through the light bulb
5533,i'm good,i'm good
5534,the electricity,thlectricity
5535,two wires have to be connected to make a complete circuit,two wires have to be connected to ato make a complete circuit
5536,it has to take a path when you collect it,it hase to make a path when you connect it
5537,complete circuits,complete circuits
5538,it light up like in her on a lamp electricity goes through and it goes through up and then still make us back up,it lights up lik an her on a lamp e electricity goes through and then it goes up and then it u it goes back on
5539,both side,both side
5540,it as how you electricity was to wires,it has to have  electricity with two wires
5541,that there is like the electricity the light bulb,that there's always the electricity flowing through the light bulb
5542,electricity,electricity
5543,its negative in positive side connected to light bulb,it's a negative and positive side connected to the light bulb
5544,i noticed that the flip this that should i noticed that if you'd put put it to the not the negative side they will go up that way but the people on the positive side then you know go the same way that it was in the begin,i noticed that if you fipit thiti noticed that if you put put it to the nnegative side then it wll go the opposite way but if you put it on the positive side the nit will go the same way that it was in the bign
5545,its flowing throught the light bulb and to the positive side,it's flowing through the light bulb into the positive side
5546,electricity,electricity
5547,if the circuit,it's a
5548,do you think electricity,do thing electricity
5549,the two wires are connected and the metal is touching,that two wires are connected and the metal is touching
5550,they see a later,see a lighter
5551,battery light bulb and wire,battery light bulb and wire
5552,i don't know,i don't know
5553,the negative,the negative
5554,electricity,electricity
5555,that they can conncet to each of them but if there if the two wires both at the base of the side of the light bulb it going to light up has it doesn't know,that they can connect to each of them but if they were if the two wires were both at the base of the side of the light bulb it wouldn't light up as it does now
5556,the ply is that it has to be touching metal with the two wires as we touching the light bulb then order of two,the point is that it has to be touching metal with the two wires has o be touching the light bulbs in order for it to lightup
5557,the really through the wires into the light bulb back into the one positive,through it through the wires into the light bulb back into the positivee
5558,yeah,yeah
5559,like if everybody got the same answer it might've taken a longer time to test out this experiment,like if everybody got the same answer it might have taken a longer time to test out this experiment
5560,well um that's just kind of how she told us to set it up,well um that's just kind of how she told us to
5561,like if i said if i was going one two three and i was doing it like maybe by myself then um i may've miscounted one and that would mess up the whole experiment,like if i said if i was going one two three and i was doing it like maybe by myself then um i may have miss counted one  and that one mess up the whole
5562,but it are you asking me like where it's set up,but it i asking me like where it' set up
5563,well if you like do it i guess if you kind of today uh we're gonna do it outside um,well if you like do it i guess if you kind of today u'm we're gonna do it outside um
5564,n mmm as long it's as long a it's the string is tight and the plane is on mmm hmm,m as long it's as long as it's the string is tight and the plaght is odder
5565,uh mmm cause i think we're gonna do one at a time mmm a ca and uh each table group is a different variable so that kinda covers it i guess we could try that,uh cause i think we're goinna do when at a time  a and uh each table group is a different variable so that kinda covers it i guess we could tr
5566,to if everyone was doing like the same variable it would take a longer time to do the experiment if everybody did the same variable and there's so many variables so i guess it's uh,sill if everyone was doing like the same variable it would take a longer time to do the experiment if everybody did the same variable and there'e so many variables so i guess so
5567,mmm hmm like um we have rubber bands and some people are gonna do like three rubber bands and they think that it'll be in less lines for the propeller,mm hm like um we have rubber bands and some people are goinna do like three rubber mands and they think that it'll be in less winds for the propeller
5568,yeah yeah mmm hmm i know,yeah yeah m hm inow
5569,we're expecting it to um make like maybe a twenty maybe like in twenty spins for the propeller since the fan is helping it push maybe that'll help,we're expecting it to um make like maybe and twenty maybe unlike and twenty spins for the propeller since the fan is helping it push maybe that w'll help
5570,um like what do you mean,um like what did you mean
5571,sorry what,sorry wa
5572,sorry um i guess to get different answers for each one,sorry um i guess to get different answers for each one
5573,yeah,yeah
5574,like,like
5575,then we wind it up and we test all of our variables,then we wind it up and we testia
5576,we're gonna do that today though,we're gonna do that today
5577,cause that will everybody wants a different answer,cause that will everybody wants a different answer
5578,i'm kind of still wondering why it goes to the side and why the pennies just obviously we pu we tried to put it in the middle but then they like go to the side,i'm kind of still lundering why it goes to the side and why the pennyis just al oosol we p we tryd to put it in the middle but then i go to the side
5579,well i i wasn't here for yesterday like i told you so if they did science,well i  i wasn't here for yesterday like i told you so if they did science
5580,the milliliters we had to see how much water could fit in our cup three centimeters,the milliliters we had to see how much water could fit in her cup three centimeters
5581,five inches,five inches
5582,well um we w first of all everybody did a thirty eight centimeter wait no everybody did three centimeters of a cup and they cut off the rest,well um we w first of all everybody did at thirty eight centim meter we know everybody did three centimeters of a cup and then cut off the rest
5583,um we did um how boats float,um we did um how boats float
5584,a sandwich,a sandwich
5585,well i think this one can hold more water,well i think the suone can hold more water
5586,one more time,more kime
5587,that like the,that like the
5588,yeah,yeah
5589,the height,the height
5590,i feel like a superstar like i already knew that no i'm kidding,feel like a super star like i already knew that noi ginni
5591,fifty s a hundred and three and fifty six,fifty s a hundred ote u and fifty sex
5592,well it's basically the mass and how much the lifeboat boat can hold,well it's basically the mass and how much the left ca boat can hold
5593,so this one holds more water so i'm guess well i'm not what i found out is it also holds more pennies as well and this one holds less water and it also holds less pennies,so this one holds more water so i'm guess well um no what i found out was it also holds more pennies as well and this one holds less water and it also holds less pennies
5594,i can't really remember,i can't really remember
5595,um good we got more than the ones that just stayed in the corner and started to sink to the side and,um good we got more than the ones that just tayed in the corner and started  sank to the side and
5596,um well w there wasn't that many other than the height and the mass those were the only very big variables and we we didn't really do any more,um well w there wasn't that many other than the height in the mass those were the only very big variables and we we didn't really do anymore
5597,yeah,yeah
5598,maybe,maybe
5599,well this one holds more,well and this one holds water
5600,is this thing on right,it is on ni
5601,oh um well i think the difference is that if you already have the pennies where you wanna place them then the mass is like um it's like not as big sorta,oh um well i think the difference is that if you already have the pennies where you want ta place them then the mass is like um it's like not as big sart of
5602,and we got it up to fifty,and we got it up to fifty
5603,is there like something i can hear myself in,is there like something i can hear myself in b
5604,i guess the higher one might sink faster,i guess the higher one might sink faster
5605,well we we just placed the pennies in all different corners,well we we just placed the pennies in all different corners
5606,e i think i did it wrong because i think i started i think i started the right way but then i thought i had to do it down here so,i i think i did it wrong because i think i started i think i started the right way but then i thought i had to do it down here so
5607,i guess it if everybody would just go one two or one two three four the the whole thing wouldn't be like that anymore,i guess it if everybody would just go one to or one to three four the the whole thing wouldn't be like that anymore
5608,say that was twenty five and then for two fifteen i would i would i would probably end up,say that was twenty five and then for two fifteen i wouldi would i would probably end up
5609,um yes but um our teacher had us count all together like like i have shown you the whole cycle,um yes but um our teacher had us count all together like like i h've showen you the whole cycle
5610,yes even the two hundred fifteen the hundred the ninety five the me,yes even the two hundred fifteen the hundred the ninety five the m
5611,sorry,
5612,mmm the two fifteen would make about,the tom fifteen would make about
5613,yeah,yeah
5614,yeah,yeah
5615,um i for the thirty eight or the different length,um i for the thirty eight or the different lengths
5616,the shorter swings uh swing more times than the um longer ones,the shorter swings uh swing more times than the um longer ones
5617,you would probably get seventeen,it would probably get seventeenn
5618,yeah,yeah
5619,yeah,yeah
5620,the numbers of the s your your swings and then these numbers are the number of your length,the numbers of the sryour swings and then these numbers are the number of your length
5621,and the the two hundred and fifteen string with the paper clip and a penny it got five,and the the two hundred and fifteen shing with a paper clip and a penny it got five
5622,so like the uh with one penny the two hundred and fifteen would still get five,so like the uh with one penniy the two hundred fifteen would still get five
5623,yeah,yeah
5624,well we did try um i think two days ago uh everybody got a different um length and then she gave us the two more pennies and um that didn't seem to change,well we did try um i think two days ago uh everybody got a different um length and then she gave us the two more pennies and um that didn't seem to change
5625,and then,and then
5626,thirty eight,thirty eight
5627,you would you would find your length cause everybody got their own and you would first find yours so for mine,you would you would find your length cause everybody got their own and you would first find yours so for mine
5628,um i guess we just i i don't really understand the question,um i guess we just i i don't realy understand the question
5629,all the way up to twenty five and it was a graph like this,all the way up to twenty five and it was a graph like this
5630,right right mmm hmm,right right
5631,or,o
5632,can i hear mys,kayheorm
5633,um sorry,um sorry
5634,that well the two hun and fifteen was dangling from here kinda just going like this and then mine was going,that well the two hundr and fifteen was stangling from here kind just going like this and then mine was going
5635,how many swings you've gotten and then on this side you would write down your length and how many swings you got,how many swings you h've gotten and then on this side you would write down your length and how many swings you got
5636,so if that was the length then,so of that was the length then
5637,yes,yes
5638,um we've been working with swingers um a pendulum,um we've been working with swingers um a pendulum
5639,like um our flip stick is a popsicle stick and there's six centimeters on it until these two come in so it's like one two three four five six,like um our flupstic is the popsicle stick and there's six centimeters on it until these two come in so it's like one two three four five six
5640,cause that's the only way you can get your result,cause that's only waking it your result
5641,for each inch so like for six inches we did four times and then we divided it by four cause we did it four times and then we got our results,four each inch so like four six inches we did four times and then we divided it by four cause we did it four times and then we got our results
5642,yeah yeah everybody does four trials on each centimeter,yeah yeah everybody does four triles on each centimeter
5643,oh oh we most of the time we make it hit to the like this part all the way down to the the next,oh oh we most of the time we make it hit to the like this part all the way down to the the next
5644,twenty,twenty
5645,by four,bye four
5646,the more far it's out it go the aluminum ball goes higher as in like it uh that we're we're having a measuring tape and sometimes it goes higher than the limit,an were far it's out it go the aluminum ball goes higher as in like it uh the where  we're having a measuring tape and sometimes it goes higher than the limite
5647,yeah um like we kinda did two variables but it's coming together as one so we're seeing how far in or out the stick is and how it affects the ball,yeah um like we kindaf da two variables but it's coming together as one so we're seeing how far in or out the stick is and how it affects the ball
5648,yeah,yeah
5649,it's like um it's how far the stick is so total the stick is total six inches so we keep pushing it in and in in more and more,it's like um it's how far the stick is so total the stick is total six inches so we keep pushing it in and in in more and ore
5650,well because the weight if it's like forty centimeters it'll definitely change everything but ten and twenty aren't that far away but if it was like forty from ten that would make a huge difference,well because the weight if it's like forty centimeters it'll defitly change everything but ten and twenty aren't that far away but if it was like forty from ten that would make a huge difference

7184,uhm when the white light shines onto the yellow ball yellow light comes out,when the white light shines onto the yellow ball yellow light comes out
7185,i've been learning about light,i've been learning about light
7186,so the light reflecting onto the ball is white and then when it comes out it is blue,so the light reflecting onto the ball is white and then when it comes out it is blue
7187,only the red color can make it around,only the red color can make go rout
7188,well uhm the light yeah is turning red when it goes through the red paper and it's covering the white paper so it looks red except for the blue ball because the red and blue ball just the blue ball just looks blue or black it just looks black,well u the light yeah is turning red when it goes to the red paper and it's covering the white paper so it looks red except for the blue ball cause the red and blue ball just the blue ball just looks blue ore black just looks black
7189,so when the white uhm light shining onto the yellow ball the yellow light comes out,so when the whight light shines onto the yellow ball the yellow light comes out
7190,good,good
7191,well i notice that there is some white light,well i noticed that there is some white light
7192,well showing from the picture a sun a candle and a light bulb,well showin from the picture a sun a candle and a light bulb
7193,white light is really the colors of the rainbow but uhm mixed together it shows white so when the uhm light goes through the prism it comes out as the colors of the rainbow,white light is really the colors of the rainbow but mixe together it shows white so when the light goes through the prism it comes out with the colors of the rainbow
7194,color won't shine through,color won't shine through
7195,i hi,hihi
7196,um you um well,um you um well
7197,it's important because if you if you measure one time it might not be the exact she ma wanna want to measure things many times so you know which is the exact and you could put them all together to see which seems right,it's important because if you if you measure one time it mignhd  hot to be the exexactly on wane to want to measure things many times so you know which is  exact hand you could put them all together to see which seems right

7385,the,the salt
7386,so you mix water any put and now open the and you pour it in the water change out put some marble stay,so you mixed the marble with water cand you put a nai over the bol and you pour it in the water jains out but the marbles stay
7387,it is dissolving into other things,it is dissolving into other things
7388,it is dissolving,it is diolving
7389,that the when the salt when you pour water in the salt it disappears and not disclosing make sure but you don't know it just looks like clean water in that in the water looks like get started,that the when the salt when you pour water in the salt it disappears and thats called a mixture but you don't know it just looks like plan water in the dirt and the water looks like that the dirt didn't get stirtd up
7390,no because it is mixed in there and when you drink it he does not come out,no because it is mixed in there and when you drink it it does not come out
7391,it is the different mixture because it is dissolving and to a different thing with the motor,ou nus a different mixture because it is divolving into a different thing with the gravel and water
7392,it is dissolving into other things,it is dissolving into other things
7393,it has separated and the,it has separated and tha
7394,the,that
7395,i've been learning about mixtures,i've been learning about mixtures
7396,its not mixture anymore,it's not mixtured anymore

7401,good how are you,good how are you
7402,that when you pour water and the salt it exhaust and disappears,that when you pour water in the salt it dissolves and disappears
7403,yes,yes
7404,to dissolving into other things like material,odissolving into other things like material
7405,that it has treated from being a mixture,that it hasrated from being a mixture
7406,its called dissolving,it's called disolving
7407,it is something otherwise that will never come back,it is something otherwise that will never come back
7408,i'm put the sand and you pour the water sand in there and all the water turned out in the sand the filtered was in the filter,put the sand and you poured the water and sand in there and the all the water trained out and the sand the dirt was in the filter
7409,well it looks like it looks like that there was,it looks like it looks like that thereis
7410,its importnat because we are separating the stuff and because so we know what mixture,it's important because we are separating the stuff and because so we know what mixtures r
7411,that when two are more things are put together its called a mixture,that when two or more things eo put together it's called a mixture

7467,that is all mixture it is called a solution,that is all o mixture and it's called a solution
7468,that when you put it together it's called a mixture and then you take it apart it is called a solution,that when you put it together it's called a mixture and when you take it apart it is called a solution
7469,salt disappeared and it is important because you tried to get back put you can not come back into you put it in the sun for about three hundred and eighty four days and it comes back in the water is gone,salt disappeared and it is important because you try to get it back but it can not come back until you put it in the sun for about three tor four days and it comes back and the water is gone
7470,that the solvent when you pour water into salt it does pour in that means it called dissolving,that the salt when you pour water into the salt it disappears and that means it's called divolving
7471,you pour the in the water and instead up in becomes put that,you pour the dirt in the water and you start it up and it becomes bt dirt
7472,the powder is going to water in yesterday and it looks like wet then,the powder is going to the water and you stuir it and it looks like wet thing
7473,that great powder,the group powder
7474,it's a mixture,it's a mixture
7475,it is a solution,it is a solution
7476,good,good
7477,it's a mixture,it's a mixture
7478,a mix a solution,a solution
7479,you put in the sun in dissolves and then it comes back and then you pour water into it and instead backup and it dissappears and the mixture,you put it in the sun and it dissolves and then it comes back and then you pour water into it and you stare  back up and it disappears in a mixture
7480,this is not a mixture,this is an a mixture
7481,i've been learning sureprise mixtures and out they dissolve and,i've been learning so far as mixtures and  they dissolve
7482,so you poured salt in a empty cup in a plate,so you pour it salt in an empty cup and you put
7483,that it might be two hours and that it could be,that it might be two hours and that it could be here now and then
7484,it's a mixture,it's a mixture
7485,yes is called it dissolving,yes it is called a divolving
7486,you are pouring salt into the water in history and it disappears and it solution and it's a mixture,you are pouring the salt into the water and you sturr it and it disappears and it's a solution and it's a mixture
7487,a solution,a solution
7488,it is mixture of,it is mixtured of
7489,have a mix it and you have,ou have a sand and water and you mix it inyo
7490,the salt disappears and the water it looks like regular water,the salt disappears and the water it looks like wick o water
7491,it just a solution,it is a solution
7492,is dissolving and it is different because the salt,is different tan divolving and it is different because the salt
7493,when the solution,a solution
7494,good,good
7495,i've been learning about mixture and solutions,i've been learning about mixtures and solutions
7496,because they don't want to go taking for it's and turns get it out,because they don't have to go dicking for it and trying to get it out
7497,its learning about mixtures and solutions and is solution is vary you separated and the mixture free put it together,it's learning about mixtures and solutions and a solution is where you separate it and a mixture is where you put it together
7498,this is th dry mixture and you cut megnet and ship in the cup and picks up about the megnetic stuff and to mix level powder and so all together,this is a dry mixture and you cut e magnet and you put it in the cup and it picks up all the magnnetic stuff and yo mixed gravel powder and salt all together

7681,i,oyeah
7682,good,good
7683,it's saturated water so that means there's so much salt in the water that it won't dissolve anymore so that means it will sink to the bottom and the water won't dissolve anymore because there's too much salt and now that means it's saturated what is it,it's saturated water so that means there's so much salt in the water that it won't dissolve anymore so that means it will sink to the bottom and the water won't dissolve anymore because there's too much salt and now that means its saturated what is it
7684,asked the same question at the same time the water is saturated which means that it can't have any more salt without it dissolving,askd the same question t the water is saturated which means that it can't have any more salt without a dissolving
7685,i couldn't hear you,i
7686,what did you say oh wait let me repeat you let me let me can i move my bar please no,what did you say owake let me repeat you let mea let me can i move my bar please kno
7687,we've been doing water,we've been doing taar
7688,the salt is saturated in the water,the salt is saturated in the water
7689,well we've been trying to saturate salt in water so we put fifty millimeters of water in a cup and then we added as much salt as we could until it couldn't evaporate,well we've been trying to saturate salt in water so we put fifty millimeters of water in a cup and then we added as much salt as we could until it couldn't envaporate
7690,it's saturated asked you like the same question do you have to ask the same question,it's saturated dat's you like the same question do you have to aske the same question
7691,that it's saturated,that it's saturated
7692,the sugar isn't dissolving and that means that it dissolves better than the epsom salt,the sugar isn't dissolving and that means it dissolves better than the epsom salt
7693,the fifty millimeters of water is heavier because they added salt and the other fifty milliliters of water doesn't have any salt and there's nothing else in it so it's just water and they both have,fifty the fifty millimeters of water is heavier because they added salt and the other ifty milliimeters doesn't have any salt and there's nothing else in it so it's just water and they both have
7694,not hi how are you,not  hi um how are you
7695,by using weights,by using weights
7696,the salt and the water and that the salt at the bottom is saturated because the water can't dissolve any more salt and that means that there's too much salt in the water,the salt and the water and that the salt at the bottom is saturated because the water can't dissolve anymore salt and that means there's too much salt in the water
7697,the sugar heads to the bottom,the sugar heads to the bottom
7698,so the water with fifty millimeters is saturated which means there's too much salt for it to dissolve so it can't dissolve anymore so the salt that's not dissolving is at the bottom,so the water which fifty millimeters is saturated which means there's too much salt for it to dissolve so it can't dissolve anymore so the salt that's not dissolving is at the bottom
7699,well the water is saturated which it means it can't it can't dissolve anymore salt because that means it's saturated and it has too much water i mean salt into the water so it's not so it's not gonna dissolve and then yeah and so it's saturated so they,well the water is saturated which it means it can it can't dissolve anymore salt because that means ta saturatedand it has too much water i mean salt into the water so it's not so it's not gong dissolve and then  and so is saturated to
7700,that means it's saturated salt,that means it's saturated salt
7701,you weighed it with the weight,you weighed it with the weight
7702,you made it heavier by putting the salt in the water and you just had so you had the same amount of water which they weighed the same so if you put salt in the other one that makes it heavier and if you didn't put any salt in the other one then it's gonna be the same,you made it heavier by putting the salt in the water and you just had so you have the same amount of water which they weighe the same so if you put salt in the other one that makes it heavier and if you didn't put any salt in the other one ten it's conna be the same

8442,no body and can i put to use just with what is,oh marni and can i please jus
8443,because it doesn't work,cause it doest folt work
8444,because the switch is,because the switch is out
8445,it breaks,it breaks
8446,i see that light bulb is not working because the switch is in on is like holding the electricity is going through light bulb,i see that the light bulb is not working because the switch is an on s like holding the electricity for going through the light bul
8447,i noticed that it doesn't work anymore because one of the light bulbs,i've noticed that it doesn't work anymore because one of the light bulbs
8448,series circuit,re circu
8449,we really it doesn't work anymore because like well what are light bulbs does work but the other one,it doesn't work anymore because like well one of the light bulbs does't work but the other would
8450,we had seen a series circuit and a parallel circuit,seen a series circuit and a parallelc
8451,light is,strikin lit is
8452,i will not know actually,i do not know actually
8453,it will work anymore because it's like that strategies hold back,it won't work anymore because it's like tike  the energy is hold back
8454,because the switch is in because the switch is in there,because the switch is't because the switch isn't there
8455,to that current stops,til the curt stops
8456,i don't know,i don't know
8457,a series,a serie
8458,i think that the battery,i think that the battery
8459,may it doesn't work or really the other one doesn't work,maybe it doesn't work or ay the other one doesn't work
8460,a parallel circuit,a parallel circuit
8461,i don't know,i don't know
8462,light bulb grow so it doesn't work so that it has to be different another,t bulb broke so it doesn't work so then it has to changenfront of them
8463,may be because it's getting too much light,maybe because it's getting too much light
8464,you know that is,no that
8465,we know that there is a battery that this three wires there is a switch,we know that there is a battery ad that there's three wires is a switch
8466,i don't know,i don't know
8467,of the battery,a the battery
8468,that one of the light bulbs broke,that whone of the light bulbs broke
8469,the light the two light bulbs are lighting because the other one is broken and then what they do what they will was it doesn't work,it doit the light the two light bulbs are lighting because the other one is broken and then what they do wwhat theyd do wa it doesn't work
8470,there were the light bulbs were lighting but there is the other one broke as they did a stuff light i get that they got it other one and it started lighting and that,mr the light bulbs were lighting but then the other one broke and they did stop lighting and ten they got a dther one and it started lighting again
8471,break,break
8472,bulb starts working because like with the switch was out it was hold that energy from the light bulb,u starts working because like when the switch was out it was holding the energy back from the light bulb
8473,work anymore because it's standard is doesn't work,don't work anymore because it's steadad it's doesn't work
8474,it's not a complete circuit,its not a complete circuit
8475,the flow the electricity is going through all three wires,the flow the electricity is going through all the three wires
8476,there is a switch for a new one,switchig for a new one
8477,any more this can no light getting,and there's no right e
8478,any more,the more
8479,would you speak a light is party,what a strik of light es marni
8480,series circuit,series circuit
8481,see that i had received a parallel circuit a series circuit,ee ti've seen a parallel circuit a series circuit and
8482,we've been learning how to complete a circuit,we've been learning how to complete circuit
8483,so,so
8484,insulators are helpful,insulators or ore healthful
8485,its starts to move because it's like like happy its energy,it starts to move because it's like like happy it's getting energy
8486,i see that the motor is moving because when i put the paper clip on top of the switch it started to move,i see that the motor is moving because when i put the paper clip on top of the switch it started to move
8487,because it's not a source of electricity or a piece of energy,because it's not a source of eelectricity pour a piece of energy
8488,good,good
8489,the motor is moving its little flag because the switch is turned on,the motor is moving its little flag because the switch is turned on
8490,the circuit will run because it is like its metal and in order for it towards that needs metal,the circuit will run because it's like it's metal and in order for it to work and needs metal
8491,all inside it and then it want,o inside it and then it won't
8492,i mean that is not getting energy because the switch is at on and the wood stick is like isn't a type of metal so it won't work,it means that it's not getting energy because the switch isn't on and the wood stick isn't like isn't a type of metal so it it won't work
8493,conducting materials are helpful but the rest of that aren't where it's to other way over can you tell that marnie,conducting materials or helpful but the rest of them aren't or it's the other way run can you tell me that marni
8494,that when you put the wood on the wood stick it is not working anymore because it's not type of metal or its type of source to make it,that when you put the wood woodthe wood stick it isn't working anymore because it's not a type of metal or type of source to make it
8495,it doesn't work because it's not like store of energy and because a battery works because that has stored energy inside it so,it doesn't work because it's not absorb of energy and t becaue a battery works because it has sto energy inside it so
8496,i said that you need a battery which has stored energy inside it and then you need two wires a switch and a motor,i said that you need a battery which has stoled energy inside it and then you need two wires a switch and a motor
8497,well i think that the light the dots are the energy and like that's was just speaking the light bulb brighter,well i think that the like the dots are the energy and like that's what's making the light bulb brighter
8498,it's just to be in a circle is very helpful because they has because the battery is giving in energy to the d cell that's how the light bulb is getting the energy improvement,electricity in a circuit is very helpful because it has because it the battery's giving  energy to the d cell n tet's how the though  light bulb is getting the energy and form it
8499,i don't know,i don't know
8500,that when those one light bulb it just one focus and like when there is a one battery it doesn't light as much as the second one because there is two for each one,bat when there's one light bulb it's just one fokis and like when there's one battery it doesn't light as much as the second one because there's stup for each one
8501,its it was the light bulbs turn brighter because it's using two batteries and so that is two stored energies into light bulbs,it's u it was the light bulbs turned brighter because it's using two batteries and so the is two stored energies in two light bulbs
8502,there are one two three four there is four path ways to a series circuit,there are one two three four there's four pathways to a serioes circuit
8503,i think the work may be,i think l work maybe
8504,the energy stored in that because it's giving energy to the light bulbs,the energy is stored and stuff because it's giving energy to the light bulbs
8505,i think the light bulbs are going to be brighter because it's using to tube a d cells and like they have stored energy so it will work,i think the light bulbs are goingna be brighter because it's using two two d cells and like they have sort of energy so it wol work
8506,can you repeat that,can you reat
8507,flow in like the battery and it has to has to go through the light bulb the wires the d cell as to go through light has to go through it has lot of things,flow in like the battery and it has to go through it has to go through the light bulb the wires the d cell  has to go through light it has to go through air it has to go through a lot of things
8508,i think that is the wire is getting energy and its going into the light bulbs so the little blue dots are like the energy coming,i think that is the the wires getting energy and it's going into the light bulbs so the little blue dots are like the energy coming
8509,it's to be touching d cell and the wires because the wires are going to gain energy and by that one is going to be like a really fun and stuff like that so just get on the last part,s to be touching d cell and the wires because the wires are going na help it get  energy and by th form it's gong ta be like really fun and stuff i guess si just guessed on the less part
8510,because they needs another wire connecting to the plus of the wires and there are not supposed to be touching,because it needs another wire connecting to the plus of the wires and they aren't supposed to be touching
8511,connecting the series circuit like it would not be the bright anymore well it will be bright because it's only used i think it won't work and i think really work light bulbs,the series circuit like it it would not be vhat bright anymore will it will be bright because it's only use i think it won't work and iit l will work but the light bulb won't
8512,may be because if the wires are the battery is giving energy to the wire and that's why the light bulb is shining and its very very very very bright,maybe because if the wires are the battery's giving energy to the wires and that's why the light bulb is shining and it's very very very very bright
8513,he is a complete format for a light bulb to work,it is a complete format for a light bulb to work
8514,it's like the energy is giving the energy it's called to the light bulb and that's how its giving energy i guess,it's like the energy is giving the energy it's gogt to the light bulb and that's how it's doing energy i guess

8982,um what,um what
8983,what's special is that one can make the li the two light bulbs bright and the other one can't it makes it a little dim,what special is that one can make the light the two light bulbs bright and the other one can't it makes it a little dim
8984,um when one bulb in the parallel circuit goes off then all the other lights stay the same they stay lit,um when one bulb in the parallel circuit goes out then all ofthe other lights stay the same they stay lit
8985,because if you put it if you put it like a series circuit then when one bulb goes out then all the other lights go out,because if you put it if you put it like a series circuit then when one bulb goes out then all the other lights go out
8986,i'm sorry marney um but i just haven't told that i need to go back to my class but i'll see you next time,soar marnie um but i just have been told that i need to go back to my class but i'll see you next time

9042,getting further apart,'r getting further apart
9043,well they had better um,well they had better um
9044,yeah because there was such a big drop like from nineteen nine that's ten washers so th the spacers must have a a lot of use,yeah because it was such a big drop like from ninetteen to nine that's ten  washers so the spacers must av had l a lot of yuice
9045,they're sticking together,they're sticking together

9050,they should do the same things,they should do the same things
9051,washers were heavy and they made the magnets lose their strength,washers were heavy and they made the magnets move their strength
9052,yeah because then it would kind of um hit the cup and then the magnets would kind of separate because of the force and then they would come back together,yeah because then it would kind of um hit the cup and then the magnets would kind of separate because of the force and then they would come back together
9053,it's broken because um the washer's thrown in there so hard that it kind of forces that cup down and the other cup to come with the magnet to separate from the other magnet,it's broken because um the washer is thrown in there so hard that it kind of forces that cup down and the other cup to come with the magnet to separate from the other magnet
9054,the magnetic the magnets get weaker and weaker as the washers get as the more washers get in the other cup,the magnetic the magnets get weaker and weaker as the washers get as the more washers get in the other cup

9058,i answered that already,i answered that already
9059,well the there's the base the wire the c d cell or the source and the light bulb the receiver and the wire the pathway,well the there's the base the wire the s d cell or the source and the light bulb the iver and the wire's the pathway
9060,the d cell um is the energy part um the wire carries the energy to the light bulb and the light bulb makes the electricity,the d cell um is the energy part um the wire air carries the energy to the light bulb and the light bulb makes the electricity
9061,well they attach to the magn to i mean to the um,od
9062,i see a d cell a light bulb um really small light bulb and some wire,i see a d cell a light bulb a m really small light bulb and some wire
9063,pretty good,pretty good
9064,i it's kind of like a root,it it's kind of like a root
9065,well today we um we made an electromagnet and a lot most of our class got electricity,well today we wum we made an electromagnet and a lot most of our class got electricity

9097,the electricity doesn't have to pass through another bulb it can just go straight back to the battery so it is very good,the electricity doesn't have to pass through another bulb it can just go straight back to the battery so it is very good
9098,um there are two,um there are two
9099,hi marnie,hi marnie
9100,yeah,yeah
9101,the,the
9102,well actually they only have one energy source because that is the d cell but they have two different wires that connect to the d cell so they can both light up the exact same amount,well actually they only have one energy source because that is the d cell but they have two different wires that connect to the d cell so they can both light up the exact same amount
9103,they are about using one d cell or battery to make two different light bulbs light up,they are about using one d cell or battery to make two different light bulbs light up
9104,yeah that that whe that uh left is the way that uh,uh that that one that uh left is the way that uh
9105,um well we knew that we'd try the halfway point at twenty first and if that went too far we'd start going lower and then we figured out the halfway point was seventeen,um well we knew that wed tried the half way point it twenty first and if that went too far we'd start going lower and then we figured oupt the half way point was seventeen
9106,um you need a certain amount of twist which is forty yeah mmm hmm um the string you have to have it on the string,um you need a certain amount of twist which is forty yeah m hm um the string you have to have it on the string
9107,yeah,yeah
9108,it's sometimes confusing cause we don't know when to change em or when to keep em the same,it's sometimes comfusing cause we don't know wend to change em or when to keep hem the same
9109,yeah,yeah
9110,yeah,yeah
9111,when you added more passengers,when you added more passengers
9112,mmm hmm yeah,uh hh yeah

9114,yeah mmm hmm yeah,yeah m hum yeah
9115,how far it would go with two passengers and then four passengers and so on,how far it would go with two passengers then four passengers and so on
9116,um maybe the it'd be another speed one but it wouldn't be with the fan it'd be with more propellers,um maybe the it'd be another speed one but it wouldn't be with the fan id be with more propellers
9117,uh because it's half of forty,uh because it's half a forty
9118,uh well because if you change two variables at the same time it might not go out go as well as you predicted it would,uh well because if you change two variables at the same time it might not go out go as well as you predicted it would

9124,maybe the speed cause we i have a friend who is doing like a f six meter one,maybe the speed cause we i have a friend who is doing like a fsix meter one
9125,uh when the plane actually flew across the string cause i didn't think it'd even get an inch,uh when the plane actually flew across the string  i didn't think it'd even get an inch
9126,yeah,yeah
9127,um because they knew that it was gonna get a lot more speed with the fan,um because they knew that it was gonna get a lot more speed with the fan
9128,mmm hmm yeah,m h yeah
9129,we wanted to see the halfway point and all the other points on the strings,we wanted to see the halfway point and all the other points on the strings
9130,uh well we tried to we figured out the halfway point and the,uh well we tried to we figured out the half way point and the
9131,uh well we put it on wrong so or i twisted it wrong and so when i twisted it one way it started going backwards,uh well we put it on wrong so or i twisted it wrong and so when i twisted it one way it started going backwards
9132,yeah mmm hmm,yeah m hm
9133,uh they are like the standard thing that makes it fly or in what you need to make it fly,uh they are like the standard thing that makes it fly air and what you need to make it fly
9134,yeah,yeah
9135,te,two
9136,mmm that we c um,that e co um
9137,that it goes backwards when you twist it and right is the way it goes forward yeah yeah,that it goes backwards when you twist it and right is the way it goes forward yeah m hum
9138,uh well because we couldn't really change that s yet and so we just kept it you at the time you could only change one variable and so,uh well because we couldn't really change that  yet and so h we just kept it you at the time you could only change one variable  su
9139,and then our standard was we didn't really have any passengers so when we put more passengers on we changed the variables a lot,and then our standard was we didn't really have any passengers so when we put more passengers on we changed the variables a lot
9140,we changed like one part of the whole standard thing,we changed like one part of the whole standard thing
9141,yeah,yeah
9142,it really just affected it a lot because usually without e with the same amount of weight that it had before it kept it on the same thing,it really just affected it a lot because usually without i with the same amount of weight that it had before it kept it on the same thing
9143,hi,hi
9144,er no it made it not as go not as far,or no it made it not a scope not as far
9145,uh well we just used the standard propeller speed,uh well we just used the standard propeller speed
9146,we just ha we had to change the amount of spins for the propeller yeah or else it wouldn't get across at all,we just had we had to change the amount of spins for the propeller yeah or else it wouldn't get across at all

9148,yeah mmm hmm,yeah m hm
9149,um we spun it eighty times and it got all the way across yeah,um we've spone it eighty times and it got all the way across yeah
9150,um well it if it well there you twist okay there's a couple ways that you can twist it if you twist it one way it'll go backwards and another way it'll go forwards,um well it if it well there you twist okay there's a couple ways that you can twist it if you twist it one way it'll go backwards in another way it'll go forwards
9151,it's probably gonna make it slow down a lot,it's probably gonna make it slow down a lot
9152,uh i love to write and do math,uh i love to write and do math
9153,um yeah,uh hum yeah
9154,if you like changed how many propellers or something that was on there it might go farther or faster,if you like changed how many propellers or something theate was on there it might go farther or faster
9155,um well those toothpicks it helps hold the propeller in so it'd stay on and won't fall off mmm hmm,um well those tooth picks it helps hold the propeller in so it' stay on ind won't fall off
9156,hmm i would have to say reading,i would have to say reading
9157,yeah we haven't cha we're gonna like put little paper clips on it,yeah we haven't cha we're gonna like put little paper clips on it

9159,yeah,yeah
9160,mmm hmm yeah,mm hmm yeah
9161,mmm hmm yeah,uh huh yeah
9162,um we start at one side of the chair and we start spinning the propeller and then we hold it and we wait and then we let it go and it just goes straight across,um we start at one side of the chair and we start spinning the propeller and then we hold it and we weight and then we let it go and it just goes straight across
9163,probably making it fly cause it took us a really long time to make it go the certain amount,probably making it fly cause it took us a really long time to make it go the certain ama
9164,yeah,yeah
9165,i don't really understand how it'd fly i just does it like suck in the a i just don't know if it sucks in the air to make it or pushes out air to make it go,i don't really understand how it'd fly i just does 't like suck in the a i just don't know if it sucks in the air to make it or pushes out air to make it go
9166,um make it go faster or maybe farther,um make it go faster or maybe farther
9167,yeah mmm hmm,yeah mmm hm
9168,um uh well uh,um uh well uh
9169,uh it was between like thirty five and forty about,uh it was between like thirty five and forty about
9170,like y you'd like twist the propeller so it gets the push of it helps the plane glide or get pushed across,like you you'd like twist the propeller so it gets the push of it helps the plane glide or get pushed across
9171,um if you go left it would go backwards and right it'd go forward,um if you go left it would go backwards and right it' go forward
9172,uh it'd be sorta like the passengers on the plane,uh it'd be sort of like the passengers on the plane
9173,yeah,yeah
9174,i didn't know that the plane would fly that easily just straight across,i didn't know that the plane would fly that easily just straight across
9175,yeah,yeah
9176,okay,o
9177,uh i'm the i have been the best reader in my grades for the past seven years yeah,uh i'm the i have been the best reiter and my grades for the past seven years yeah
9178,because the paper clips make it a lot heavier and usually it's just lights and it it'll just fly across but with the paper clips,because the paper clips make it a lot heavier and usually it's just light and it it'll just fly across but with the paper clips
9179,they're like about that big and you hook em onto the plane and we're gonna see how many can get across without making it stop,they're like about that big and you hook em on to the plane and we're goinna see how many can get across without making it stop
9180,yeah,yeah
9181,yeah,yeah
9182,um well the straws just help it keep it on the strings so that it can fly,um well the straws just help it keep it on the strings so that it can fly
9183,yeah and the propeller is really the main thing cause it really gets the push it just make it go right across,yeah and the propeller is really the main thing cause it really gets the push tot just make it go right across

9191,uh put it put lighter weights on it,uh put it put lighter lights on it
9192,mmm hmm yeah,h yeah
9193,yeah if,yeah if
9194,we um we changed the variables by making the mass of the tin foil squares bigger like we'll go to thirty centimeter tin foil sheets and then so on,we um we changed the variables by making the mass of the ten foil square as bigger like weill go to thirty centimeter tin pail sheets and then so on
9195,it would go a lot farther cause it has less weight and,it would go a lot farther cause it has less weight an
9196,uh all the way in yeah is yeah,uh all the way in yeah is yeah
9197,yeah yeah,yeah yeah
9198,it wouldn't you couldn't really compare anything cause your answers to it would be all different and yeah,it wouldn't you couldn't really recompare anything cause thour answers to it would be all different and yeah

9200,yeah,yeah
9201,cause uh then it tells you uh more about it and what you're gonna really do in the science project,cause uh uh then it tells you uh more about it and  what you're goinna really do in the science projects
9202,yeah,yeah
9203,ball uh i forgot what it's called yeah or except we made ours square cause it'll stay on the stick better,ball uh i forgot what it's called yeah orexcept we made our square cause it'll stay on the stick beatter

9214,yeah,yeah
9215,aluminum foil,aluminivor
9216,it would be way off because they would go like across the room and other people would only go maybe like a quarter of the way across the room,it would be way off because they would go like across the room and other people would only go maybe like a corder of the way across theromee
9217,it's gonna go not as far,it's gonna go not a far
9218,it would probably get m all messed up and wouldn't work just like it was supposed to and just t just stop working after they tried it,it would probably get  all messed up and wouldn't work just like it was supposed to and just just stop working after they tried it

9293,well when you don't hook it up right with the wires and the battery and the light bulbs,well when you don't hook it up right with the wires and the battery and the light bulbs
9294,yes,yes
9295,yeah,i don't know
9296,well the energy comes from this side into the light bulb,well the energy comes from this side into the light bulb
9297,well we were supposed to use one but our group thought maybe two batteries for two light bulbs but that didn't really work so we took one d cell,well we were uposed to use one but our group that maybe two batteries for two light bulbs but that didn't really work so we took one d cell
9298,yeah,yeah
9299,yes sometimes,yes sometimes
9300,yeah,yeah
9301,probably right here,probably right here
9302,yeah kind of we were like uh maybe this isn't the right way to do it,yeah kind of we were like um maybe this sthe right way to do it
9303,and then this connects to the switch,and then this connects to the switch
9304,yeah,yeah
9305,the switch is working it's a closed circuit when the switch is working and when it's open it's an open circuit and open circuits don't work so when you lift it up it won't work cause it's an open circuit,the switch is working it's a closed circuit when the switch is working and when it's open it's an open circuit and the open circuit is don't work so when you lift it up it won't work cause it's an open circuit
9306,and this hooks up to the light bulb chamber,and it sicks up to the light bulb chamb
9307,it's here and that,s er and the  ther one comes e
9308,that's a switch and then these are where you connect the wires,that's a switch and then these are way yto connect the wires
9309,i think so maybe,i think so maybe
9310,well,well
9311,okay,okay
9312,well,well
9313,and we probably touched the switch to,t would probably attach to the switch to
9314,well,well
9315,most of them yeah,most of hem yeah
9316,here into the other,here into the other
9317,okay,te
9318,that having two batteries would be kind of harder since you have two light bulbs it would seem to be easier but because we have two more one more to h battery to handle it's a little bit harder,that having two batteries t would be kind of harder since you have two light bulbs it wou'd seem to be easier but because we have two more one mart battery to handle it's a little bit harder
9319,um it's not connected so there's no usually a circuit would go like this it's full,um it's not connected so there's no usually a circuit bould go like this it's full
9320,and it goes through,and it goes through
9321,energy and then it goes out,energy and then it goes out
9322,this is the positive side and this is the negative side,this is the positive side and this is the negative side
9323,yeah my teacher did it's parallel circuits well we noticed that the light bulb when it lit up it was dull so parallel circuits i think make them light up more,yeah my teacher did it's parallel circuits well we noticed that the light bulb wouldn't lit up it was dull so parallel circuits i think make them light up more
9324,when you connect it to the light bulb i it has to connect to metal to metal or it won't work,when you connect it to the light bulb it has to connect metal to metal or it won't work
9325,that parallel can never touch,that parallel can never touch
9326,the switch makes them turn on and off so maybe if you go up or down you could always come back to off or on or,the switch makes them turn on and off so maybe if you go up or down you cold always come back to off for on her
9327,nah uh,huh
9328,so the light bulb can get all of it's,so the light bulb can get all of its
9329,because it was kind of too complicated to do it with two cause you had to figure out a special way when with one battery you could do a whole bunch of ways,because it was kind as you' complicated to do it with two cause you had to figure out a special weight when with one battery could ou cold bunch of weys
9330,the pa negative side of the battery and then this would have the positive side,the p the negative side of the battery and then this would have the positive side
9331,yeah,yeah
9332,mmm hmm yay,m  y
9333,yeah,yeah
9334,yeah,yeah
9335,she could put another bulb in,she could put another bulb in
9336,the light bulb does not light up,the light bulb does not light up
9337,yeah,yeah
9338,only one uh a brother he's in college now though,only one uh a brother he's ging callicge now thoughmmm
9339,a parallel circuit is when they never touch so if one bulb goes out it'll just be out and all the others will just keep going because well it's its own little circuit kind of,a parallel circuit is when they never touch so if one bulb goes out it'll just be out and all the others will just keep going because well it's it's own little circuit kind of
9340,an open circuit is when um is when maybe if you have a switch in a series circuit and you lift it up it becomes an open circuit and nothing happens,an open circuit is when um is when maybe if you have a switch in a series circuit and you lift it up it becomes an open circuit and nothing happens
9341,well it it stops the whole light from being lighted cause it makes an open circuit,well it it stops the whole lights from being lighted cause it makes an open circuit
9342,parallel,parallel
9343,i think it would go out,i think it would go out
9344,mmm hmm yeah,m hm yeah
9345,yes yeah,yes yeah
9346,actually that one would probably well,actually that one would probably wel
9347,okay,oh heah
9348,um well it's just like any other light bulb uh the filament would break,um well it's just like any other light bulb up the filament will break
9349,hello no yeah,well no yeah
9350,so it would come out here and then go through here and then come here and then come through here except there probably wouldn't be enough left after it went through over here,so it would come out here a i go through here and then come here and then come through here except there probably wouldn't be enough left after it went through over here
9351,um they all stopped,um they all stopped
9352,those lights are bright e they're brighter than the series and i think it's because they don't take each other's electricity,those lights are bright they're brighter than the series and i think it's because they don't take each other's electricity
9353,yep,yup
9354,sure,sure
9355,the bulb would just stay light,the bulb would just stay lit
9356,the no,the no
9357,it had way too much electricity and then and then when you reached three it'll just blow up the light bulb,it had weighs too much electricity and then and then when you reach three it'll just belout ae light bulb
9358,and it never it never really actually attaches wires to the other light bulb,and it never it in never really actually attaches wires to the other light bulb
9359,well it would create the electricity to go straight through,well it 'd create the electricity to go straight through
9360,well the lights at first they would go on then when a filament would break it would not be able to all open,well the lights at first they would go on when when a filament would break it would not be able to all open
9361,and then this one would take some of the electricity and then go like this,and then this one would take some of the electricity to make it like this
9362,yeah our teacher told us to do that but we didn't really get the whole thing i yeah how do we wer the people that were making a parallel didn't know exactly how to do that,yeah our teacher told us to do that but we didn't really get the whole thing i yeah how are we we're  the people that were making a parallel didn't know exactly how to do that
9363,afternoon,afternoon
9364,um well of course the light bulb is probably lighting up most likely of course and well,um well of course the light bulb is probably lighting up most likely of course and well
9365,yeah i think it would be like maybe one circuit and then the other circuit but,yeah i think it would be like maybe one circuit and then the other circuit but
9366,yeah,yeah
9367,yeah,yeah
9368,and then go back into the light bulb to make it go out,and then go back into the light bulb to make it go out
9369,cause they never touch,cause they never touched
9370,electricity,electricity
9371,because it's an open circuit and um it's not attaching t well it's not metal to metal in,because it's an open circuit and um it's not attaching well it's not metal to metal an
9372,um no that's a series,um nont of the series
9373,circuit yep,circuit yep
9374,yeah that one looks right,yeah that on looks right
9375,yes mmm hmm,yes mmm hm
9376,okay,oko
9377,i,big i
9378,yeah,yeah
9379,um there's just not enough electricity to create uh enough for two,um there's just not enough electricity to create uh enough for too
9380,well when you have a light bulb like this one i guess it would be li um the light bulb would,well when you have a light bulb like this one i guess it would be le um the light bulb would
9381,that's is s s the battery d cell,that is the battery d cell
9382,well okay so this would be the pa this would be the positive side and then so it would go through and then into the light bulb and then out back,well agay so this would be the po this would be the positive side and then so it would go through d then into the light bulb and then out back
9383,yeah,yeh
9384,it's all stopping and staying,it's all stopping and studying
9385,yeah well it would probably be brighter or the same because it's it's own little circuit so it wouldn't really,yeah well it would probabby be brighter or the same because it's it's a little circuit so it wouldn't really
9386,that'd probably be a parallel mine are that way too,that'd probably be a parallel mine arn that waight too
9387,yeah um almost ten,yeah um almost ten
9388,these aren't working,these are't working
9389,because when you press it down metal to metal it just goes straight through all the way to the light bulb,because when you press it down metal to metal it just goes straight through all the way to the light bulb
9390,i don't know,i don't know
9391,well we want to make a parallel circuit,well we want to make a parallel circuit
9392,yeah,yeah
9393,except when we tried um putting two d cells together um positive side to positive or negative side just putting them together,except when we tried um putting two d cells together um positive side to positive or negative side just putting them together
9394,that would probably i don't know well,i don't probably i don't know well
9395,yeah,yeah
9396,yeah,yeah
9397,no but we thought about it and then we decided to and they probably are doing it right now,no but we thought about it and then we decided to and they probably are doing it right now
9398,complete the flow,complete the flow
9399,well,well
9400,yeah,yeah
9401,yeah,yeah m hm
9402,yes,yes
9403,hello,i d'
9404,okay,hay
9405,well,well
9406,yeah,yeah
9407,um yeah that looks about right,um yeah it looks about right
9408,the battery um creates the electricity to the flow,the battery um creates the electricity to the flow
9409,yeah,yeah
9410,yeah,yeah
9411,he goes to front range in fort collins,he goes to front areagion for collums
9412,i would tell here that the lights did not burn out it's just one of them burned out and created an open circuit to make it as the electricity wouldn't flow through,i would tell her that the lights did not burn out it's just one of them burned out and created in open circuit to make it as the electricity wouldn't flow through
9413,um you would have a battery,um you wou'ld have a battery
9414,um it got brighter i think it even go brighter than the parallel circuit,um it got brighter i think it even got brighter than the parallel circuit
9415,april twenty fourth,aprl twenty fourth
9416,yeah,yeaah
9417,but i think i have an idea mmm well that's like a series but,but i think i have a idea m that's like a series but
9418,mmm yeah,mm yeah
9419,well when you have,well when you have
9420,yeah he comes to town every weekend,yeah it comes down every week and
9421,yes in the series circuit that i made we had very dull light bulbs so,yes in the series circuit that i made we had very dull light bulbs so
9422,normally on a series i think i don't know either,a marally on a series i think ia lter
9423,mmm hmm um the light bulb doesn't light up,m hm um the light bulb doesn't light up
9424,yeah,yeah
9425,um the more wraps you you do around the rivet makes it so that it's stronger and maybe it keeps like a lot of energy going through it the more wraps,um the more wraps you you do around the rivet makes it so that it' stronger and may be it keeps like a lot of energy going through it the more wraps
9426,i did um my prediction was that ten would pick up half of its number and that did not happen,i did um my prediction was that ten would pick up half of its number and what did not happen
9427,yeah we did,yeah we did
9428,well whatever,uh whatever
9429,um um it looked well here's the zero zero my axis um,um um it looked well here's the zero zero i axcies und
9430,and sometimes uh there was both sides there was a wire and then on the end it was split into two so it would be like one battery over here and one battery over here,and sometimes un there was both sides there was a wire and then on the end it was split into two so it would be like one battery ove here and one battery over here
9431,yes,yes
9432,um no lines are the dots are where the line where it goes and so then that picked up three so it'd be,um no lines are the dots are where the line where it goes and so then that picked up three so iti'd be

9435,he's talking about the food tomorrow for international day,he's talking about the food tomorrow for inter national day
9436,here yeah and then thirty picked up seven it should be four five and six about here,here yeah and then thirty picked up seven witch should be four five six about here
9437,um yeah we're going to make a telegraph,um yeah we're gon na make a tilograph
9438,i don't know why he keeps talking,i don't know wi kit keeps talking
9439,um no wait yes i thought that the more wraps you had the more washers you would pick up,um no wait yes i thought that the more wraps you had the more washers you would pick up
9440,oh well i don't think i think i did that wrong i think it goes like this and then this one,o well i don't think i think i did that wrong i think it goes like this and then this one
9441,here,here
9442,yes,yes
9443,um the energy went straight to e from the wire to the um the rivet,um the energy went straight to  from the wire to the um the rivet
9444,yeah,yeah
9445,um you can't turn a magnet off but you can turn electromagnet off,um you can't turn a magnet off but you can turn electromagnet off
9446,well since we did ten wraps and it only picked up two it'd be like,well since we did ten wraps and it only picked up to it'd be like
9447,um yes because it was wrapped around in a in a wire and it was kinda like a s a long stick,um yes because it was wrapped around and a  in a wire and it was kind af like a sa lung stick
9448,um that a magnet is actually made to pick them up and then when you have an electromagnet you have to do stuff to it to make it pick stuff up,um that a magnet is actually made to pick them up and then when you havean electromagnet you have to do stuff too it to make it pick stuff up
9449,um i think we're gonna use like everything that we've done already and to make it because um it cause all the time it just leads up to something bigger,um i think we're gonna use like everything that weh've done already and to make it because um it cause all the time it just leads up to something bigger
9450,yeah,yeah
9451,he made um a robot that um does magic tricks,he made um a rowbot that um does madric tricks
9452,and it would probably be not even,and it would probably be not even
9453,um i think it seemed weaker um when we used one battery but when we used two it made it bigger,um i think it seemed weaker um when we used one battery but when we used two it made it bigger
9454,yeah that surprised me from the gap between ten and forty five yeah and we did it thirty times and that only got us seven so that makes really weird sense,yeah that's surprised meve from the gap between ten and forty five yeah and we did it thirty times not only got a seven so that makes really weird sense
9455,no we didn't have a switch,no we didn't have a switch
9456,of washers,uh rushers
9457,a line point graph a line point graph,a line point graph a line point graph
9458,um because i thought it would pick up at least half of it's number like five except it just picked up two so it's,um because i thought it would pick up at least half of its number like five except it just picked up two so it'shu
9459,the only thing that i can think of is like um uh uh uh at uh a junkyard where um they pick up like the cars and the metal things with the big magnet,the only thing at i can think it was like um a at ah at um a junk yard where um they pick up like the cars and the metal things with ta big magnet
9460,um we had it hooked up to a battery,um we had to hooked up toou a battery
9461,um i don't know because we we only practice with washers but a magnet did pick those up so,um i don't know because we we only practiced with washers but a magnet dig pick those up so
9462,and then ten twenty thirty forty it actually did go up to fifty so,and then ten twenty thirty forty it actually did go up to fifty so
9463,um wraps,um wraps
9464,mmm hmm yeah,m hm yeah
9465,um we had a wire connected to the battery that was wrapped around the rivet um and then the other side went back onto the other side of the wire went back onto the wire battery,um you had a wire connected to the battery that was wrapped around the river um and then the other side went back onto the other side of the wire went back onto the wire battery
9466,um we started making light bulbs light with a battery then we went into motors and then we made circuits and then we just started,um we started making light bulbs light with a battery then we went into motories and then we made circuits and then we just started
9467,and of course this wrap increased kind of more than what we did because it was ten and ten and ten and then this one did fifteen,and of course this a wrap increased kind of more than what we we did because it was ten and ten and ten and then this one did fifteen
9468,um it's when you have a wire and an iron like stick sort of thing,um it's when you have a wire and an iron like stick sort of thing
9469,we read about he stopped um,we read about he stopped um
9470,next wednesday,next ones day
9471,the graph yeah it was kinda built in like this and then it had ten twenty thirty forty and,graph yeah it was kind of built in like this a then it it had ten twenty thirty forty and
9472,um he used his watch making skills and his magician skills,um he used his watch making scales and his magition scalles
9473,stronger,stronger
9474,yeah we tried it with ten wraps and that us two washers,yeah we tried it with ten wraps and that got us two washers
9475,um not exactly but when we hooked the the last wire up to the battery it would work,um not exactly but when we hook the the last wire up to the battery it would work
9476,yeah but it depends on the m magnet size of course and the rivet size,yeah but it depends on the magnet size of course and the rivet size
9477,that's really weird,that's really wd
9478,wrap it with wires and connect it to batteries and,wrap it with wires and connect it too batteriesand
9479,that'd be like the first line,that'ld be like the first line
9480,today we made an electromagnet yeah,today we made an electromagnet yeah
9481,um that the beginning it started off really small and then it got bigger and then huger,um that the beginning it started off really small bhen it got bigger and then hugeer
9482,it looked like like,it looked like like
9483,yeah,yeah
9484,they both pick up iron things,they both pick up iron things
9485,um what surprised me was that ten wraps would pick up only two,um what surprised o me was that ten wraps would pick up only two
9486,um yeah i think he used an electromagnet because that's what what we read before we did the electromagnet so it's probably what he used,um yeah i think we used an electromagnet because that's what wha we read before we did the electromagnet so  it's probably what yoe used
9487,wraps,wraped
9488,well becau we had a thousand ten but we also had this um cup that was a hundred so we used that too so i sorta you know,well because u we had a thousand ten but we also had this um cup that was a hundred so we used that two so i sort a know
9489,yeah because you know it's a hundred so you know it's gonna be right there but you'd have to do it ten times so yeah,you kna because ou know it's a hundred so you know it's gonna be right there but you'd have to do it ten times so yeah
9490,n mmm not really,not really
9491,uh one hundred milliliters fills up that,um one hundred milliliters fills up that
9492,well it's it's it's the same thing as the other one except they just flipped up,well it's it's it's the same thing as the other one except i just flipped up
9493,thanks,thangts
9494,mmm not really cause we all had different bottles every group so not really mmm hmm,m not really cause we all had different bottles every group so not really m hmm
9495,well because the if you use the same size everyone would have the same answer basically unless one's wider,well because the if you used the same size everyone would have the same answer basically unless one's wider
9496,mmm hmm yeah uh huh yep,mm yeah uh huh yup
9497,well this is one milliliter this is one hundred milliliters and this is like a thousand so you can like see the huge difference between them,well this is one milliliter this is one hunded milliliters and this is like a thousand so you can like see the huge difference between them
9498,um i'm not sure how many times but,um i'm not sure how many times but
9499,no not really it was it was um just like um seven up bottles not cans but bottles like the bo the big bottles yeah,no not really it was it was um you it just like um seven up bottles not cans but bottles like the bot the big bottles yeah
9500,yeah it sorta was,yeah it's sort of does
9501,the last one,the last one
9502,two hundred,to o
9503,yeah one milliliter,yeah  one milli
9504,yeah i guess,yeah mi guess
9505,so so you're more,so so you're more
9506,huh well then probably have the same thing twice,huh well then probably have the same thing twice
9507,not all the way not all the way,'m not all the way not all the way
9508,mmm not really,not really
9509,really yeah,really uh yeah
9510,that's a f that's a um,that's a f that's a um
9511,i think it just is trying to trick us but y you just did that one you already did that one,i think it' just is trying to trick us but yo you just did that  you wuld already did that
9512,the lines well um they they just tell you how much how full it would be it,the lions well um they they just tell you how much how full it would be hit
9513,well because we wanted to keep track so we w so we wouldn't like get confused so yeah that's,well because we wanted to keep track so we w so we wouldn't like at confused so yeah that's
9514,yeah cause i don't really think you could put the top in there anyways,yeah cause i don't really think it culd put the top in there or any ways
9515,yes no it doesn't look the same but it is the same because it's just that this is more taller and this is more wider but if you like if you like shrunk this into that it would be the same,yeah s no it doesn't look the same but it is the same because it's just sik this is more taller and this is more wighter but if you like if you' like shrunk this into that it would be the same
9516,yeah,yeah
9517,mmm no i don't think so so it's just showing ten ten a hundreds would fit in a thousand,in't think so h so it's just showing ten ten hundreds would fit in a thousand
9518,yeah,yeah
9519,this well that's the fulcrum and it's the part where where you put the balance on like and it's where you get it like even,this well that's the full grum and it's the part where where you put the balance on like and it's where you get it like even

9526,mmm no,no
9527,yeah yeah,yeah yeah
9528,we're working with that that and that,we're working with that that and that
9529,a big one equal yeah a big one equals a gram,a bigg one equa yeah bigg one eu qalls a gram
9530,no well that's not one gram the well the little ones are five grams the littlest ones like that look like that are five grams and then the bigger ones are a little big bigger than that,no well that's not one gram the well the little ones are five grams the littleest ones like that look like that ar five grams and then the bigger ones are little big bigger than that
9531,no not yet,no not yet
9532,i probably use that instead of a whole bunch of those cause that's like way bigger than that so that one's probably a better like thing to put in the cups and you know,i probably use that instead of a whole munch of those cause that's like way bigger than that so that one's probably a better like thing to put in the cups and you know
9533,mmm hmm and then i put in the bag and i waited until it got like um level and it,m hm and then i put in the bag and i waihted until it got like um level thend it w
9534,yeah w f first i hold it in my hands and i weigh it and then i put it in it and then i guess,yeah we f first i hold in my hand then i weigh it and ten i put it in it and then i guess
9535,no not really,no not really
9536,and we're learning about like the base the fulcrum and the balance,and we're learning about like the base the full crum and the balance
9537,no we haven't,no we haven't
9538,yeah this is like exactly what we use,yeah this is like exactly what we use
9539,yeah,yeah
9540,oh yeah and um it's just because if it's like way down here you wouldn't guess like one gram because how could that be possible,oh yeah and um it's just because if it's like way down here you wouldn't guess like one gram because how could that be possible
9541,well um we just do estimates like um uh educt educated guess and,well um we just do estimates like um uh  eegucated guess and
9542,well it just um let's the balance um s it makes it steady and not like wibble wobby,well it just um that's the balance um s it makes it steuady and not like wibbl lopbly
9543,it seems like this is a thousand of those gram pieces and then this is probably if you stick em all together like really tight it'd probably equal that,it seems like this is a thousand of those gram pieces and then this is probably if you stick em all together like really tight it'd probably equal that

10421,there's like a billion centa centigrams in a kilogram so uh,there's like a builland centigcentigrams in a kilogram so
10422,and then you take a five and then another five and if it's too heavy when you put in the n another five you would take the five out and put in four little gram pieces,and then you take a five and then another five and if it's too heavy when you put in the  another five you'd take the five out and put in four little gram pieces
10423,um the,um the
10424,yeah,yeah
10425,so when you're measuring it out with the grams then when it's perfectly leveled you subtract um one or two of the grams from the sponge so then you know that's how much water,so when you're measuring it out with the grams then when it's perfectly leveled you subtract um one or two of the grams from the sponge so then you know that's how much water
10426,because it may be too much,because it maybe too much
10427,he light very light,light very light
10428,because maybe they they were cut unevenly,because maybe they they were cut un evenly

11613,i think they get their energy from when they eat bones and break them down,i think they get their energy from when they eat bones and break them down
11614,they ate all that paper and leave and when once they pooped it out it turned into soil,they at all of that paper and leaves and it when once they pooped it out it turned into soil
11615,i don't know what the word is but i think it's another word to describe it is like vegetarian,i don't know what the word is bi think its but another wored to describe is like vegetarion
11616,i think it just a consumer is all kind of all about eating to survive,i think it's just a consumer is all kind of all about eating to survive
11617,so we have a healthier planet,so we have a healthier planet
11618,i been learning about the food web producers um decomposer and consumers,i've been learning about the food web producers m decomposers and consumers
11619,it's a decomposer,iit''s a decomposer
11620,a bear what it means to me it is an omnivore,a bear what it means to me it is an omnivore
11621,it eats like um snow white rabbits and that white count look like a hamster,it eats like  snow white rabbits and that white coun't look like a hampster
11622,i think it's kinda like a vegetarian for some people,i think it's kind of like a vegatarim for some people
11623,makes them a decomposer,makes them a decomposer
11624,so they aren't all the same like some are vegetarian and some are meat eaters,so they aren't all the same like some are vegetarion and some are meat meaters
11625,it tells me not like us humans or carnivore or herbivores they don't eat that kind of stuff only decomposer eat that kind of stuff,it tells me not like u humans or carnivores or herbivores they don't eat that kind of stuff only decomposers to eat that kind of stuff
11626,a plant like grows it's own food through photosynthesis kinda like a cycle or ecosystem and it's kinda like an evolution,a plant like grows its own food through photosynthesis kind of like an cycle or ecosystem and it's kind of like avolsion
11627,it's kinda like when we recycle and throw away trash,it's kind of like when we recycle and through away trash
11628,i think it what it has to do is like um,i think o what it has to do is like
11629,animals get their energy from the producers from like eating and drinking and kinda like energy from the sun like just like producers maybe,animals get their energy from the producers from like eating and drinking and kind of like energy from the sun like just like producers maybe
11630,it's because they don't eat anything and they just make their own food so like the consumers could eat them,it's because they don't eat anything and they just make their own food so like the consumers caun eat them
11631,they eat it all and then once they poop it out it turns into soil,they eat it all and then once they poop it out it turns into soil
11632,a carnivore is like the lion and the polar bear they only eat meat,a carnivore is like the line in thae poler they only eat meat
11633,i think they eat um eat grass which is on the right of the top front picture,i think the u e grass which is on the right of the top front picture
11634,a worms are um they are a decomposer which they break down stuff like um those the d thing,a worms are they are a decomposer which they break down stuff like those d thing
11635,i think they eat kinda like trash and broken down bones and mostly and then they turn that into soil,i think they eat how like trash and broken down bones and mostly and then they turn that into soil
11636,that makes it a herbivore because it only eats meat,that makes it a herbivore because it only eats meat
11637,i think it breaks stuff down,i think it breaks stuff down
11638,it is an omnivore just like us humans it eats meat and plant,it is an omnivore just like u humus it eats meat and plant
11639,a producer goes through it's photosynthesis it makes it's own food it doesn't eat anything,a producer goes through its photosynthesis and makes it's own food it doesn't eat anything
11640,consumer is like what it eats and like what their enemies eat them,consumer is like what it eats and like what thei're empnies eat them
11641,i think is what eats what,i think is what eats what
11642,they break down so it could turn into organic or soil,they break down so it can turn into organic or soil
11643,like humans and bears they eat meat and plants,like humans and bears they eat meat and plants
11644,good,good
11645,i notice all the trash and leaves have been shortened that means it took it days or weeks or maybe years,i noticed all the trach an leaves have been shortend that means it took in days or weeks or maybe years
11646,they eat like all kinds of trash and what they return is they return nutrients to the earth,they eat like all kinds of trash and what they return is they return nnutrients to the earth
11647,that means it's an omnivore,that means it's an omnivore
11648,what is has to be it's kinda like um um killing others like this bear is eating a fish and probably the red tailed hawk eats like rabbits and birds,whet it has to be it's kind of like  killing others like like this bear is eating a fish and probably the red taile hawk eats like rabbits and bird
11649,there's herbivore omnivore carnivore and i don't know what the last one is,there's herbivore omnivore carnivore and i don't know what the last one is
11650,i think what it means to be an omnivore like humans and black bears eat meat and plants,i think what it means to be an arnivore like humans and black bears eat meat and plants
11651,they break down decaying and decaying matter and they turn it into soil,they break down decaying and decaying matter and they turn it into soil
11652,that tells me it has to return something to the earth because they ate something that means that um they returned nutrients to the earth,that tells me it has to return something to the earth because they ate something that means that they return nutrients to the earth
11653,it is a consumer,it is a consumer
11654,this is all about what animals and fungi and bacteria eat,this is all about what animals and fungi and bacteria eat
11655,means to be a carnivore is like lions and polar bears only eat meat that's what a carnivore is,meas to be a carnivore is like lions and pollar bears only eat meat that's what a carnivore is
11656,good,good
11657,they go through their own photosyfesis to make their own food,they go through their own photosynthesis to make their own food
11658,what makes a plant a producer is because it makes it's own through photosynfesis um from sunshine and water,what makes a plant a producer is because it makes its own through fruits photo synthesis from sunshine and water
11659,it only eats plants that means it's a herbivore,it only eats plants that means it's a herbivore
11660,a producer makes it's own food and it gets sunshine and water to makes it's own photosynfesis and makes it's own food,a producer makes its own food and it gets sunshine and water to makes its own phtosynthesis and makes its own food
11661,and herbivore means like like elk or deer or bunnies only eat plant,an herbivore means like like alk or deager or bunnies only eat plants
11662,the bear is an omnivore because it eats meat and plants,the bear is an omnivore because it eats  meat and plants
11663,they get it from decaynah and decahnuh organ organic matter,they get it from decana and decana orgaorganic matter
11664,get their energy from eating other they can't they can't eat themselves because and they can't make their own food so that's why they have to eat the other animals and they eat producers,s get their energy from eating other they can' they can't eat themselves because and they can't make their own food so that's why they have to eat other animals and they eat producers
11665,it's not a producer or a consumer it's a decomposer,it's not a producer or a consumer it's a decomposer
11666,they eat it all and then they turn it into soil that's why they are a decomposer,they eat it all and then they turn it into soil that's why they are a decomposer
11667,i think that producers are the grass and the pinecone,i think the producers are the grass in the pine cone
11668,what it's all about because it breaks down here or digging um all organists of matter,what it's all about because it breaks down here or diging deccaria all organis of matter
11669,no they are not,no they are not
11670,i think why it's so important is just because um they return nutrients and we nutrients in our body,i think why it's so important it's just because they return nutrients and we nutrients in our body
11671,i think what's to be a consumer is um to um eat other things they're not they don't they can't make their own food they have to eat other things to get their energy,i think what's to be a consumer is to  eat other ther things they're not they don't they can't make their own food they have to eat other things to get their energy
11672,when they return nutrients to the world like we kinda return nutrients to the cause we need nutrients in our body,when they return nutrients to the world like wek kind of return nutrients tool because we need nutrients in our body
11673,i think what it means to be a decomposer that it means it eats it and then it um returns nutrients to the earth,i think what it bmeans to be a decomposer that it means it eats it and then it  rturns nutrients to the earth
11674,because they break down bones and also they can turn it into something new like soil just like worms,because they break down bones and also they can turn it into something new like soil just like worms
11675,the decomposers are mushroom or fungi and bacteria,the decomposers are mushroom or fungi and bacteria
11676,i been learning about the food web also producers decomposers and consumers,i've been learning about the food web also producers decomposers and consumers
11677,it's a decomposer it eats decaying and decaying matter and returns nutrients to the earth,it's a decomposer it eats decaying and decaying matter and it ret turns nutrients to the earth
11678,i think what the lungs do is that um they give us oxygen and the main organ for breathing is in humans and so that's what i think about lung,i think what the lungs do is that they give us oxygen and the main organ for breathing is in humans and so that's what i think about lungs
11679,they uh bring in oxygen with exchange of the carbon dioxide,they  bring inoxygen with exchange of the carbon dioxide
11680,what the lungs do is that once we breathe in it gets kind of fatter and bigger and once we go out it gets smaller,what the lungs do is that once we breathe in it gets kind of fatter and bigger and once we breathe out it goes smaller
11681,that um it's going through and through like i see like some circular things and it's going by from the heart and the capillary and others,that m it's going through and thhrough like i see like some circular things and it's going by the from the heart and the cataparalle and others
11682,how they inhale and exhale is inhale is like once you breathe in from the nose which is the filter and then exhale is when you breathe out,how they inhale and x hale is inhale is like once you breathe in from the nose which is the filter and then x hales when you breathe out
11683,i think what it's all about is that it's showing how um where air goes in and carbon dioxide goes out in and out of your mouth or your nose,i think what it's all about is that it's showing how where air goes in and carbon diox ite goes out in and out of your mouth or your nose
11684,what the respiratory system does is like it helps you breathe like when it it goes in and out of your lungs when oxygen goes in and carbon dioxide goes out,what the respiratory system does is like it helps you breathe like when itit goes in and out of your lungs when oxygen goes in and carbon dioxide goes out
11685,i see little circles like it's getting passed through like a system like the carbon dioxide is going out and oxygen is going in,i see little circles like it's getting passd through like a system like the carbon dioxide is going out and oxygen is going in
11686,doing good,doing good
11687,they're responsible for i think when carbon oxygen goes in and they're responsible for carbon dioxide to go out,they're responsible for i think when carbon oxygen goes in and they're responsible for carbon dioxide to go out
11688,what the exchange of gases is all about is we survive with oxygen we can't survive with carbon dioxide cause that's kind of a poison oxygen to us,what the exchange of gases all about is we survived with oxygen we can't survive with carbon dioxide cause that's kind of a poison oxygen to us
11689,first of all we need to survive second of all um it's our only way of life to breathe,first of all we need to survive second of all it's our only way of life to breathe
11690,that would probably be oxygen,that would probably be oxygen
11691,the gas exchange is from those alveoli and um that's where um where the oxygen goes in and the carbon dioxide goes out,the gastixchangement is from those aveol and that's where where the oxygen goes in and the carbon dioxide goes out
11692,i think it is e for lungs,i think it is e for lungs
11693,i think their behavior is safety because they don't want to be eaten when they are flying high in the air,i think thei're behavior is safety because they don't want to be eatenn theyi're flang high in the air
11694,i'm doing good,i'm doing good
11695,this is a non learned behavior because they're hatching from their egg and they're they're already crawling out to sea,this is a non learned behavior because they're hatching from their eg and theyr there already crawling out to se
11696,the stimulus is because the skunk or the coyote has an adaptation the skunk has a,the stimulus is because  the skunk or the coyoti has a aactation the skunk has
11697,so i think why so it could swim and like it could like it could like push it in case if like one of it's ducklings like comes falling behind,so i think wy so it could swim and like it could like it could like push it incase if like one of its ducklings like comes falling behind
11698,he would probably attack for it or just run away,he would probably attack for it or just run away
11699,that the rattlesnake is rattling it's tail to say go away from me or else i'll bite,that the rattlesnake is rattling it's hill to say go away from me or also bike
11700,it's telling the person like once a snake's tail it rattles then it's about to attack the person,it's telling the person like once a snakes tail it rattles then it's about to attack the person
11701,no,no
11702,like the reactions of people and animals,like the reactions of people and animals
11703,i think it's migrate behavior cause they're like not getting eaten,i think it's my grape behavior bcause you're like not getting eaten
11704,that they wanted to protect themselves from other predators,that they wanted to protect themselves from other predators
11705,like the flippers help em kind of like feet to swim and also the beak for like to eat like fish or something for like its food or something,like  the flippers help um kind of like feed to swim and also the beak for like to eat like fish or something for like it's food or something
11706,it's a not learned behavior,it's a not learned behavior
11707,that it could shoot a bad smell out of its tail,that it could shoot a bad smell out of its tail
11708,a cat is falling from a tree,a cat is flowing from a tree
11709,it's pretty much marking its territory so predators can't eat it and also how one way they could defend themselves,it's pretty much marking it's territory so  predators can't eat it and also how one way they could defend themselve
11710,i think it's a learning behavior because you are learning how to write your name,i think it's a learning behavior because you're learning how to write your name
11711,that he's telling the person to go away or else i'll bite you because he's trying to defend himself from predators like humans,that he's telling the person to go away or else i bite you because he's trying to defend himself from predators like humans
11712,that the skunks tail is one of the adaptations because it shoots the smell out of it,that the skuns tail is one of the adaptations cause it shoouts the smell out of it
11713,that they all have different reactions on different things,that they all have different reactions on different things
11714,because usually animals are scared of bright colors or predators are scared of bright colors,cause usually animals are scared to brigke colors or predators or scare to brigke colors
11715,like it's kind of like the same color as the ground and also the turtle can actually hide in its shell and also it can come in so no predators can get it,like it's kind of like the same color as the grown and also the turtle can actually hide it in its shell and also it can come in so no predators can get it
11716,that means what the reaction part is i would probably just go away from it,that means what the reaction part is i would probably just go away from it
11717,i think it's a migration behavior because the black thing is stuck on the human's knee,i think it's a migrational behavior because  the black thing is stuck on the human's nee
11718,that like the dog wants to catch the frisbee and he is having fun and also the birds are flying together so they could be safe,that like the dog wantes to catch the frizge bang he's having fun and also the birds are flying together so they coaund be safe
11719,it's instinctive because it's reacting cause it's falling and he wants to land safely on the ground,it's instinctive because it's reacting because it's falling and he onts the land safely on the ground
11720,i think it's kind of like like a migration behavior,i think it's kind of like alike a micr behavior
11721,i think number two the teeth because that's how it chews the meat,i think number two the teeth because that's how it chews the meat
11722,i think it's the wings because it helps it fly away faster from the predator,i think it's the wings because it helps it fly away faster from the predat
11723,i think it's six because the houses the land the mountains the sky the trees and that little um blue grey brown thing,i think its sick because the housees the land the mountains the sky the trees and that little blue gray brown thing
11724,i see the water i see the atmosphere which is the sky i see the mountains i see some trees and some houses,i see the water i see the atmosphere which is the sky i see the mountains i see some trees and some houses
11725,i think the biosphere is made out of um probably trees and humans and animals probably just trees plants and animals,i think the biosphere is made out of  probably trees and humans and animals probably just trees plants and animals that's what i think
11726,the biosphere is probably all about life like trees plants and us like humans,the biosphere is probably all about life like trees plants and us like humans
11727,good,goo
11728,i think they're just trying to survive not like to get eaten but probably the most dangerous ones are a snake a red tailed hawk,i think they're just trying to survive not like to get eaten but probably the most dangerous ones ore a snake and ta red tailed hawk
11729,well probably most animals go for probably bacteria mushrooms and um the others just go for like plants,ell probably most animals go for probably bacteria mushrooms and the others just go for like plants
11730,i think some yeah,i think some yeah
11731,it's kinda mostly in the same thing but it's mostly in the winter or like antarctica or like where mount everest is,it's kind of mostly and the same thing but it's mostly in the winter or like  artogo or like where mounteverit is
11732,i think it represents the climate or weather or like the temperature,i think it represents the climate or weather or like the temperature
11733,what it needs is to survive is probably soil water air and sunshine,what it needs is to survive is probably soil water air and sunshine
11734,they don't get their own food they make their own food cause they're a producer and it makes it's own food through photosynthesis,they don't get their own food they make their own food because they're a producer and it makes its own food through photosynthensis
11735,they make it through their own photosynthesis,they make it through their own photosynthesis
11736,it kind of looks green but it it has sunshine and air but no water so that's why it's kind of like bending,it kinda looks screen but it it has sunshine o air but no water so that's why it's kind of like bending
11737,i think all those cells like combine to make one whole like tiny grain of sand of yeast,i think all those cells like combined to make one hole like tiny green of sand of yeast
11738,it's like what eats what and what eats them,it's like what eats what and what eats them
11739,when water sunshine and air and like all those combine together the roots go down into the dirt and then when which comes out is like a plant,when water sunshine and air r like all those combine together the roots go down into the dirt and then when which comes out is like a plant
11740,it's kind of like when you get like a sunburn like a human and it's getting all yellow cause it has no sun and it's not getting any green,it's kind of like when you get like a sunburn like a human and it's getting all yellow because it has no sun and it's not getting any green
11741,doing good,doing good
11742,they do not because because when it rains in the spring it gets water and then sunshine and then it gets air when it blows,they do not because because when it rains in the spring it gets water and then sunshine and then it gets air when it blows
11743,i think plants i read a book about this and it probably needs carbon dioxide which is kind of it's air,i think plants i wread a book about this and it probably needs carbon dioxide which is kind of its air
11744,actually no because when i did my experiment in the bag we didn't use any water and it's and it's still growing on its own,actually know because when i did my experiment in the bag we didn't use any water and it's n it's still growing on its own
11745,yes they do need it,yes they do need it
11746,yes it does,yes it does
11747,it's because they were all sickly and not healthy,it's because they were all sickly and not healthy
11748,it wouldn't be a problem because like i just said it goes through it's own photosynthesis which it makes it's own food it can't eat anything,it wouldn't be a problem because um like it just said um it goes through its own photosynthesis which it makes its own food they can't eat anything
11749,when we put the plants in the bag it had like a ton of air or carbon dioxide in it and that's why it needs to survive,when we put the plants in the bag m it had like a tonac air o curbon dioxide in it and that's why it needs to survive
11750,it has two out of three but not three out of three because they it needs water air and sunshine it can not be water air and no sunshine,it has two out of three but not three out of three because t it needs water air and sunshine it cannot be water air and no sunshine
11751,i think it's trying to make some kind of signal or something,i think it's trying to make some kind of singnal or something
11752,because it can't breathe any carbon dioxide and it's not breathing out any oxygen,because it can't breathe any carbbon dioxide and it's not breathing out any oxygen
11753,i think it's kind of like plants like they need sunshine air and water,i think it's kind of like plants like they need sunshine air and water
11754,yes it would be missing three things sun water and air,yes it would be missing three things sun water and air
11755,how it relates to me is like it goes through it's own photosynthesis it needs sunshine water and air for it to grow,how it relates to me is like um it goes through its otophphotosynthesis it needs sunshine water and air for it to grow
11756,where food webs start will probably be at the producers because probably most consumers eat those producers,where food webs start will probably be at the producers because probably most consumers eat those producers
11757,they just stay in one place they don't move besides they make their own food through photosynthesis with the sun carbon dioxide and water,they just stay in on place they don't move besides  they make their own food through photosynthesis with the sun come carbon dioxide and wa
11758,think what it's trying to show is that sunshine reflects off the plant so it can,i think what is trying to show is that sunshine reflects off the plant so it can
11759,because grass and the pine cone on the tree are producers and the plants are producers they make their own food which the consumers eat,because um grass i an the pine cone on the tree are producers and the plants are producers they make their own food which um the consumers eat
11760,yes they do need it because it's kind of like what they need to breathe,yes they do need it because it's kind of like what they need to breathe
11761,what i just really think is just what eats what eats the producers consumers and the decomposers,what i just really think is just what eats what and what eats the producers consumers and the decomposers
11762,it's because it doesn't have any water,it's because it doesn't have any water
11763,i think light when it reflects so it helps it grow i think the water when you pour it so it stays healthy and the carbon dioxide which it breathes in and oxygen it breathes,i think light when it reflects so it healps it grow i think the water when you pour it so it stays healthy and the courbon dioxide which it breathes in in oxygen it breathes
11764,i think they do because some animals eat them and that will protect them from animals,i think they do because  some animals eat them and that will protect them from animals
11765,i think why is because there's no wind and there's just sunshine and water but it has to be complete with water air and sunshine for it to grow,i think y is because there's no wind and there's just sunshine in water but it has to be complete with water air and sun shine for it to grow
11766,it has water sunshine but no air,it has water sunshine but no air
11767,the sun,the sun
11768,no they do not need food because they they have they have their own photosynthesis which they make their own food,no they do not need food because they they have they have their own photosynthesis which they make their own food
11769,like some people say so it doesn't damage it,like some people say um so it doesn't damage it
11770,sometimes when consumers are eating them they'll have to put fertilizer around it so the animals can't eat cause if they eat it it'll kind of be like a gross taste,sometimes when consumers are eating them they'll have to put fertilizer around it so the animals can't eat it cause if they eat it kind of be like a growse taste
11771,it shows like a like a like a some kind of of drink that makes it grow food,it shows like a like  like a some kind of  drink that makes it grow foud
11772,it's because they do their own photosynthesis which they make their own food,it's because they do their own photosynthesis which they make their own food
11773,it has all three things water air and sunshine,tthas all three things water air and sunshine
11774,i think anything else to point out to me is like when the yeast kind of like rises from the bread except it gets it puffy for the air or carbon dioxide that flows in the bag,i think anything else to point out to me is like when the yeast kind of like rises from a bread except it gets it puffy for the car like air or carbon dioxide that flows in the ba
11775,yes it can because if it doesn't have any sunshine it will turn like first day it will turn tan then it will turn yellow not green,yes it can be cause if it doesn't have any sunshine it will turn like first day it will turn tan then it will turn yellow not green
11776,it's all healthy and because it has all three things water air and sunshine,it's all healthy an nutriet because it has all three things water air and sunshine
11777,what i observe is like little tiny particles inside the yeast when it's like kind of like mixed with the water,what i observe is like little tighty particles inside the yeast when it's like how like mixed with the water
11778,it's a house,it's a house
11779,what's important about producers is because they make their own food and once a consumer comes because they can't make their own food they have to eat something that's why they eat the producers,whit's important about producers is because um they make their own food and then antce a consumer comes because um they can't make their own food they have to eat something that's why the eat the producers
11780,that means it's a all and healthy plant,that means it's a all nutriated and healthy plant
11781,it's because they need light energy carbon dioxide and water so all those things so it can produce it's own food without those three things it can not grow,it's because they need light energy carbon dioxide and water so all those thrings so it can produce its own food without those three things it can not grow
11782,there is one of like parallel there is that is palmate and there's one that is parallel,there is one of like parallel there is one that is palmate and there's one that is parallel
11783,some examples are simple leaf parallel leaf and palmate leaf,some examples are simple leaf parallel leaf and palmate leaf
11784,i think the veins are for like they also use like the blood which it pumps in kind of like the human body's veins,i think the veins are four like they also use like the blood  which it pumps in kind of like the human bodies veins
11785,i've been learning about veins from leaves and from sap from trees and also some other stuff from science,i've been learning about veins from leaves and from sap from trees and also some other stuff from science
11786,one is called simple another is palmate and the third one is parallel,one is called simple another is palmate and the third one is parallel
11787,i think it comes from the air cause kind of like from the clouds it gives like water out once it rains so i think that's why,i think it comes from the air cause kind of like from the clouds it gives like water at once it rains so i think that's why
11788,it is the pattern of their veins and also the outside shape which it was born with,it is the pattern of the veins and also the outside shape which it was born with
11789,that tells me that it is a simple leaf,that tells me that it is a simple leaf
11790,i think it's a simple leaf because it's kind of like half and half and it's all parallel and it's kind of like the same on half,i think it's a symple leaf because it's kind of like half ind half and it's all parallel and it's kindof like the same on half
11791,i think it is a simple leaf because it's veins are going kind of like a circular outside direction,i think it is a symplleaf because it's veins are going kind of like a circular outside direction
11792,how it gets it's nutrients and that's getting out of it kind of like the carbon dioxide it's breathe i meant sorry the oxygen it's breathing out,how it gets its nutrients and the exyliums that's getting out of it kind of like the carbon dioxide it's breath i meant sorry the oxygen it's breathing out
11793,i think it was somebody that put a guy a bag and poured water in it or maybe it was just rain,i think it was somebody that put a go a bag and poured water in it or maybe it was just rain
11794,it is the air and water i see like particles of air and particles of water,it is the air and water i see like particles of air and particles of water
11795,like the phloem is like going down in the plant like it's nutrients and probably that kind of like the oxygen that's coming out of it,like the polem is like going down in the plant like it's nutrients and probably exlium that like kind of like the oxygen that's coming out of it
11796,i am doing good today,i am doing good today
11797,that it has like different things like like the nutrients go inside and then something else goes outside of it,that it has like different things like like the nutrients go inside and then something else goes outside of it
11798,the esophagus it does that pushes all the food down into the stomach,the esophascus it does m that itpushes all the food down into the stomach
11799,mouth the mouth usually just chews it and swallows it,mouth the mouth usually just cheowse it and swallows it
11800,oh it it pushes down all the chewed up food like it like those little bits so it could like fit through that kind of like little tube of the esophagus,oh  it um pushes down all the chewed up food  like it like those little bits so it caun like ufit through that kind of like little tube of the esophagus
11801,i see,i
11802,just to usually just to break down the food and once you're hungry you eat some so it won't go kind of like hungry for a little bit,just o usually just break down the food and once you're hungry you eat som so it won't go  kind of li hungry for a little bit
11803,i think what's for the muscle cells is like they help your muscles grow or something or i think they'll help you move it,i think what's for the muscle cells is like the helps your muscles like grow or something or i think they'll help you move it
11804,they are probably made out of meat,they are probably made out of meats
11805,like in a digestive system it has to have like some kind of cells cause maybe like the saliva that's been in your mouth once you eat it maybe those cells kind of like break it down,like in a digestive system it has to have like some kind of cells cause maybe like the saliva that spin your mouth once you eat it maybe those cells kind of like break it down
11806,think the leaf has like a ton of,like ta leaf has like a toun
11807,there are like all sorts of cells and maybe they carry the nutrients for the arm so the skin's healthy,theyare like all sourts of cells and maybe they carry the nutrients for the arm so the skin's healthy
11808,doing good,doing good
11809,they usually just break down the food which you eat when you're hungry,e usually just break down the food which you eat when you're hungry
11810,i think what they are is like some kind of like nutrients that help the skin like stay like healthy and stays smooth,i think what they are is like m some kind of like nutrients that healp the skin like stay like healthy and stays smoothe
11811,it's trying to show me those brain cells,it's trying to show me those bbrain cells
11812,what the mouth does is once you chew it goes down into your body into the stomach,what the mouth does is when once you chew it goes down into your body into the stomach
11813,what i notice about it is a human body and i think it's pointing to certain things where the cells are for most important stuff,what i noticed about is a human body and i think it's pointing umto certain things where the cells are for most important stuff
11814,i think the butterfly has cells because it needs some kind if thing like it like sucks up pollen,i think the butterfly hesls because it needs some kind of thing like it like sooks a polen
11815,what it tells me is like there's like huge cells and like there's less cells in a leaf because their all all the cells are in one section,what it tells me is like there's like huge cells and like there's less cells in a leaf because they're all all the cells are in one section
11816,i see all sorts of cells and i see some veins plus i see the skin,i see all sorts of cells and i see some veins plus um i see the skin
11817,it usually just usually just pushes it down into the stomach that's probably which i all know,it usually just usually just pushes it down into the stomach that's probably which i all know
11818,they are they are all sorts of cells,they a they are all sorts of cells
11819,they both drink,they both drink
11820,like it's kind of like all in the digestive system like all over your body like somehow it could like breaks it down or has a certain job to do for the whole body,like it's kind of like all in the digestive system like all over your body like somehow it col like breaks it down or has a certain jop to do for the whole body
11821,i notice that what this is similar to them that they have cells,i noticed that whats is similar to them that they have cells
11822,i think what it's trying to show us is like once you eat it where it goes through and how like the steps where it goes through to break down all the food and then you pee it out,i think what it's trying to show us is like whenc you eat it where it goes through and how like the steps where it goes through to break down all the food and then you pea it out
11823,i see like shapes kind of like a and maybe there will be all sorts of cells kind of like a to tell like messages to the body,i see like shapes kind of like o sparks and maybe there'll be all sorts of cells kind of like a moving to tell like messages to the body
11824,i think what the muscle cells are like they help your muscles move,i think what the muscl cells are like they help your muscles move
11825,i think they are because they both have blood inside of each other,i think they are because they both have blood inside of each other
11826,i think this was trying to show is kind of like the yeast is kind of like the skin of a human body,i think it's whas trying to show iskin of like the yeast is kinof like the skin of a human body
11827,but i also know is just travels all along with those cells like with the food how like side by side or like in a line or something,but i also know it's just travels all along with those cells like with tha food cato like side by side or like in a line or something
11828,that it has all cells because it's a living organism,that it has all cells because it's a living organism
11829,i think what those brain cells like they like send messages to the body like like tell the hand to move,i think what those brain shows like the like sent messages to the body like like till the hand to move
11830,it's the gastric juice in the acid,it's se gastic juice in the acid
11831,the skin cells are for like your skin so they stay healthy,the skin cells are for like your skins so they stay healthy
11832,i think they're both different cells because they're not working for like like yeast cells are not working for human cells,i they're both different cells because they're not working for like like geast cells are not working for human cells
11833,i've been learning about the digestive system and also i've been learning about like how it works through your body,i've been learning about the digestive system and also i've been learning about like how it works m through your body
11834,it was important because they have to be good in have to put in good and if if they're not well done they can break,it's important because they have to be good in they have to put in good and if if they're not well dome they can break
11835,i think what i would like to test is seeing seeing how far it goes and seeing the li the block can go be heavier,i think what i would like to test is seeing seeing how far it goes and seeing the little the block can go beheavior
11836,i think it's,thank you to marnie
11837,we have seen a flipper system,we have to seen the floper system
11838,good bye,good bye
11839,you need a something to make it flip you need you need a stick and to measure it,you need uh something to make it flip you need you need a stick and to measure it
11840,i think you would just by um for example you can say the brook holds the stick in and it makes it and you measure it and it makes it go in,i think you would just strype it by um for example you can say the brok colds the stick in and it makes it and you measure it and it makes it go in
11841,it makes it a system because the propeller's spinning around,it makes it a system because the propeller's spinning around
11842,i think we haven't,i think we haven't
11843,we have been learning about flippers and we have been yeah we have been learning about flippers,ye have been learning about flippers and we have been yeah we have been learning about flipers
11844,i think what you can change you can,through a heavier bl block to see if it goes farther
11845,i think what that is all about is measuring it and seeing how far it goes,i think what that is all about is measuring it and seeing how far it goes
11846,i think what's going on there it makes a good flipper system because it bounces off and it holds it tight and you don't want to bounce it off that high because the the stick can break,i think what's going on there it makes it a soaper system because it bounces off and it holds it tight and you know one a bounce it off that hight because a bitsit can break
11847,i'm very good,i'm very good
11848,you can also um do a smaller stick and see yeah you can do that too,you can usso um do a smaller stick and to see yea you can do that too
11849,when you click it it bounces off,when you click it it bounces off
11850,these are all about measuring how far the brook goes and seeing if it goes that far,these objects are all about measuring how far the brookgoes and seeing if it goes that far
11851,i found out that you get you're measuring it and that you're seeing how far the brook goes and if it doesn't go that far you put the capacity you write the capacity and you,i found out that you get you' measuring met and that you're seeing how far the brok goes and if it doesn't go that far you put the capacity you reade the capacity and you
11852,um you can flip,you can do this experiment you can do
11853,um you can think of,um you can think of
11854,i think what the base is all about is measuring it and like seeing if it goes far,i think what the basis all about is measuring it and like seeing if it goes far
11855,i think what is up with that object would be um seeing how far it goes maybe,and i think what is up with thet object would be um seeing how far it goe maybe
11856,um you can the block that holds the stick it can be smaller or it can be heavier,um you can the block that holds the stick it can be smaller or it can be heavier
11857,there is something on the on top of it and that you hold it you put it under the block and you just flip it and you see how far it goes,there is something on the on top of it and that you hold it you put it under the block and you just flip it and you see how far it goes
11858,it connects it by putting the stick on the bottom of the brick and if it goes far you just push it in you just take it out and it's and then just put it,it connects it by putting the stick on the bottom of the brick and if it goes far you just push it in you just take it out and it's and then you just put it
11859,spinning the rubberband around and seeing how how far it goes,i think it is all about
11860,systems are all about measuring and doing seeing seeing what how the system looks,systems are all about measuring and  w saing seeing what how the system looks
11861,what's going on with that is that we have to learn about pendulums we have to learn how to p how to do science and and to learn more things,wat's going on with that is that we have to learn about pendulums and e have to learn how to put how to do science and an to learn more things
11862,no some of them hold ten or nine,no some of them hold ten or nine
11863,very well,t's very well
11864,you can build them out of lifeboats you can build them out of wood,you can build them out of lifeboats you can build them out of wood
11865,learn about o,learng about
11866,i i think i'm not sure i think you have to measure thirty centimeters on them and we learned how to how many pendulums that it can hold and how much water it can hold,i i think i'm not sure i think you have to measure thirty centimeters on them and we learned how to how many pendulums it it can hold and how much water it can hold
11867,about eleven and c could have ten and the shortest one could have eight,about eleven and c could have ten and the shartest one could have eight
11868,i think it could connect to the capacity of the boat would be we can just measure measure em and it can be eighty millimeters or sixty two millimeters thirty eight fifty five millimeters,i think it could connect to the capacity of the boat would be you can just measure measure im and it can be eighty millimeters or sixty two millimeters thirty eight fifty five millimeters
11869,bye,bye
11870,i've built mine out of pa out of paper cups,i built mine out of ppe out of paper cups
11871,first you have to measure a the boat and see and put it in the water and you i think you measure thirty centimeters on them and then you'd need to,first you have to measure up the boat and c and put it in the water and you i think you measure thirty centimeters on them and then you'd need to
11872,why i think they got a different number of pennies is because they cutted them shorter or longer,why i think they got a different number of penneces because they caught it them shorter or longer
11873,i would think about putting pennies in it or water,i would think about putting pennies in it or water
11874,i discovered that the boat can fit twelve twelve pendulums in the little boat,i discovered that the boat can fi twelve twelve pendulums and in the little buab
11875,when i when i noticed that a wasn't drowning that much i started putting more and more uh pendulums in em and when i drowned it i i got my answer really easily,when i  when i noticed that a wasn't drowning that much i started putting more and more pendulums in em and when it drownded i i got my answer really easily
11876,we have been learning about boats and we have been putting pendulums in the boats and seeing how many pendulums can fit inside the little boat,we have been learning about boats and we have been putting pendulums in the boats and seeing how many pendulums can fate inside the little boat
11877,we,we
11878,the lifeboats are all about you go you can go on a romantic date you can,um go to the river and get on them you can have a pickneck in them
11879,what is going on there is the propeller is the string is making it balance it and it keeps going around and around propeller keeps going around and around,wha t it's going on there is the propeller is the string is smaking it balance it and it keeps going around and around puople at keeps going around and around
11880,i think it will because it has to have more power on it and it has to go up farther and i think that would affect it,i think it will because it has to have more power in it and it has to go up farther and i think that would affect thit
11881,so it has also been nice talking to you marty,sol it has also been nice talking to you marnie
11882,what we've been doing in science we were we have been doing airplanes we have been seeing is the airplane propeller can fly,we've we've been doing in science we were we have been doing airplanes and we have been seeing if the airplane propeller can fly
11883,thank you,thank you
11884,thank you,thank you
11885,i think when setting up your my experiment was it was tricky to put it together but it worked really well and,i think whene suetting up thert my experiment was it was tricket an put it together but it worked really well and
11886,it's going very well marty,t's going very well marnie
11887,you can also change the propeller you can use fishing you can use fishing wire and you can make the propeller smaller you can make the the,yeah
11888,you,you
11889,okay so how many spins it takes spins are forty five spins it made and the distance is how much meter how much meters you measure it,okay so how many spins it takes spins are forty five spins it made in the distance is how much meter how much meters you measure it
11890,so what the parts of the plane i use the propeller is making it spin and the string the straw and the string is making it balance it,so whath the parts of the plane are used the propeller is making it spin and the string the straw and the string is making it balance it
11891,i think the kinds of things that are important what makes if fly is the propeller makes it fly and that the string is balanced and a and that the straw is great is put good on it,i think the kinds of things that are important whent makes it fly is a propeller mixes it fly and that the string with ballance and ah and that the straw is gra is put good on it
11892,i think what that is all about it makes the propeller spin and if we don't have the rubber band in the bottom it's not going to work,i think what that is all about it makes the propeller spin and if you didn't have the rubber un in the waterm mit's not gonna work
11893,you have to the propeller is all about making the propeller spin,you have to the propeller is all about making the propeller spin
11894,when it spins the thing on the bottom spins around too with it and m and then you measure how much far it went,when it spins the thing on the bottom spins around two ifh it and um and then you measure how much far it went
11895,i think the number of swings isn't right because you ha also the string has to be balanced and the propeller has to be moving,i think the number  of swings is an' right because you have also the string has to be balanced and the propeller has to be moving
11896,with string,the string
11897,thank you,thank you
11898,marnie,marnie
11899,i think what is important about the flying line is because and it attaches to it and it makes it balance and if e you don't have it on the bottom it's gonna not go that fast,i think what is important about the flyane lime is because um it attaches to it and it makes it balance and if figyoue don't have it on the bottom it's gonna not go that fast
11900,okay,kay
11901,what you can also do when the parts are all working together is you can put the string into the straw and then you can just swing it across and it balance it and if it doesn't balance it's going to wiggle a lot,whell you can also do when the parts aall working together is you can put the string into the straw and then you can just swing it across and it balance it and if it doesn't balance it's gonna wigl up
11902,okay,okay
11903,i think that if the string isn't balanced that well it's not gonna work it's not gonna spin it's it's it's just not gonna work,i think that if the string is an' balanced thawt well it's not gonna work it's not gonno spin it's's it's just not gonna work
11904,yeah that's it,the propeller on it and then you need to just stap el the t other other um
11905,i am very well how are you marnie,i'm mvary well how are you marnie
11906,i think the other things that are important when you are flying your plane is that it's really balanced and it's not wiggling a lot and that your propeller spins,i think the other things that are important when your flaang your plant is that it's really balanced and it's not when bikling a lot and that your propeller spins
11907,i think the propellers are all about i am guessing that the propellers are to keep it balanced,i think the propellers are all about i am guessing that the propellers are to keep it balanced
11908,me too,mee towo
11909,um well maybe it's you have to put the airplane hanging attached to a string and you have to see how if it can fly,um well maybe it's you have to put the airplane hanging attached to a string and you have to see how if it can fly
11910,bye it's been nice talking to you too,bye it's been nice talking to you too
11911,i think how i might affect it is because the second one isn't really well done and if it goes up it's gonna go back down and the first one is gonna keep going straight,i think how it might affect it is because the second one isn't really well done and if it goes up it's goinna go back down and the first one it's gonna keep going straight
11912,i think it's balancing it and it's making the airplane fly,i think it's balancing it and it's making the airplane fly
11913,thank you,thank you
11914,the string was all about seeing how fast the airplane could h fly and the string,the string was all about seeing how fast the air plane couldt have fly and the string
11915,i think what that was all about was,i think what that was all about was
11916,it can stay a magnet as um for a bit longer than it can stick to the magnet but it loses its magnetism,it can say an magneti um for a bit longer than it can stick to the magnet but it loses its magnetism
11917,the magnet rubbing the nail will give some magnetism to the nail so it can pick up the paper clip,the magnet rubbing the nail wigive some magnetism to the nail so it can pick up the paper clip
11918,they can go through thin objects and also they can connect to each other when they're off but the magnetism is so strong between the two magnets that it can pull through the table,they can go through thin objects and also they can connect to each other when they're off but the magnetism is so strong between the two magnets that it can pull through the table
11919,this magnet that we're showing here has been connected cause the paper is very thin,this magnet that we're showing here has been connected cause the paper is very thin
11920,the magnet ca is lifting up the nail that is sending electrons to the to the paper clip,the magnet c is lifting up the nail that is sending electrto the favor clip
11921,if you do not have the strongest magnetism in your magnet it cannot get through thicker things,if you do not have the strongest magnetism in your magnet it cannot get through thicker things
11922,nail picked up the nail picked up the paper clip but then it lost its magnetism and then and then the magnet came back to give it more magnetism and it could pick up the paper clip again,nail picked up the nail picked up the paper clip but then it lost its magnetism and then and then the magnet came back to give it more magnetism and it could pick up the paper clip again
11923,a nail has some magnetism in it to pick up the um the paper clip,the nail has some magnetism in it to pick up the um the paper clip
11924,the nail can only s um stay like a magnet so long because cause it does not it cannot keep as a magnet can the magnetism that stays in it forever,the nail can only s um stay like a magnet so long because cause it does not it cannot keep as a magnet can the magnetism that stays in it forever
11925,the nail is using magnetism to um keep the paper clip on it but the paper clip can only stay on so long cause the magnetism um wears off after a while,the nail is using magnetism to um keep the paper clip on it but the paper clip can only stay on so long cause the magnetism um wears off after a while
11926,well magnets can stick to each other because they both have iron and they can attract because they're on different sides,well magnets can stick to each other because they both have iron and they can attract because they're in different sides
11927,the nail cannot always be a magnet and the magnet is always a magnet,the nail can not always be a magnet and the magnet is always a magnet
11928,the nail is not a magnet so it can't pick up the paper clip when it's not connected to the magnet,the nail is not a magnet so it can't pick up the paper clip when it's not connected to the magnet
11929,magnetism is when um the magnet can stick to things with iron in them,agnetism is when um the magnet can stick to things with iron in them
11930,it is picking up something with iron it just like the the magnet is doing to the nail,it is picking up something with iron it just like the the magnet is doing to the nail
11931,the nail is acting just like it can be in its own magnet because it is using the magnet's force,the nail is acting just like it can be an its own magnet because it is using the magnets force
11932,we've been learning about magnets,we've been learning about magnets
11933,i have put it through paper it has gone through some thin tables and also it sticks to all iron,i have put it through paper it is gone through some thin tables and also it sticks o all iron
11934,magnets going through things can only go through certain things cause they're not as thick as other things,magnets going through things can only goe through certain things cause they're not as thick as other things
11935,the paper clip can stay on the um on the nail for many times and falls when the magnet has no more magnetism in it in it,the paper clip can stay on the um um the nail for many times and ifalls when the magnet has no more magnetism in it in it
11936,the magnets both have iron in them and they're on the r the different sides so they are still attracting,the magnets both have iron in them and they're on the  the different sides so they are still attracting
11937,the magnets on the same time and the table thi is not that thin i mean it's not that thick so it mus they must have been pulling each other because magnetism,the magnets orn  on the same time in the table  is not that thin i mean it's not that sthick so it mut they must have been pulling each other because fthe magnetism
11938,the paper clip is dropping off the nail because the magnetin magnetis magnetism because of many things,the paper clip is dropping up the nail because the magnetsm magnetis magnetism because of many things
11939,bye,bye
11940,i know that magnets stick to iron,i know that magnets stick to iron
11941,if you rub the magnet on the nail it'll collect enough force so that it can pick up the paper clip,if you rubb the magnet on the nail it'll collect enough force so that it can pick up the paper clip
11942,if the magnet touches the nail then then it can come up and create its own magnetism,if the magnet touches the nail then then it can come up and create its own magnetism
11943,magnet doesn't have enough force pick up the paper clip so the paper clip fell on the floor instead of going through like the thin piece of paper and connecting to the magnet,magnet doesn't have enough force to pick up the paper clips so the paper clip fell on the floor instead of going through like the thin piece of paper and connecting to the magnet
