1292,ACTUALLY THE WIND MIGHT ALSO BE HELPING EVAPORATE,ACTUALLY TE WIN MI ALSOBE HELPING OF VAPRATE
1293,WELL JUNGLE IS FOR MOISTNESS CAUSE IT HAS MORE RAIN BUT DESERT HAS EVEN IF YOU DID PUT A LITTLE WATER THERE IT'D EVAPORATE REALLY QUICKLY CAUSE THE TEMPERATURE IS SO HOT,WELL JUNGLE IS FULL OF MOISTNUSS CAUSE IT HAS MORE BRAN BTY A DOERT HAS EVEN IF YO WOD DED BUBBLE O WATERTER AND AVAPERATE REALY QUICKLY CAUSE THE TEMPERATURE IS SO HOGT
1294,DIFFERENT,IFFERENT
1295,WHEN IT'S WARM IT LOSES MORE BECAUSE UM WHEN IT'S WARM THAT HELPS THE EVAPORATION,WHEN IT IS WARM IT ROZES MORE BECAUSE UHM WHEN IT'S WARM THAT HELPS E I THATPBRATION
1296,IT WOULD EASILY COME AND EVAPORATE THE WATER,IT WOULD EASILY COME AND VEPPERATE THEWATER
1297,WHEN THE AIR'S FULL OF MOISTURE OR WHEN IT'S HUMID WHEN WELL WHEN THE AIR IS FULL OF MOISTURE IT HAS LESS CHANCE OF EVAPORATING BUT IT'S HUMID IT HAS A WAY BETTER CHANCE OF EVAPORATING,WHEN THE AIRS WRE MORE SURE WHN IT'S HUMID WHEN WEL TAIRS FULL OF MOISTURE AS THE STRANS OF VPERATI BT IT'S HUMAN IT WAS A W BETTER CHANCE OF EVAPERATING
1298,UM BECAUSE IT'S PUSHING IT AWAY FROM THE HEAT,UHM BECAUSE IS PUSHING IT AWAY FROM THE HE
1299,IT EVAPORATES AND SOMETIMES IT MAKES A LITTLE RAIN CLOUD,A VAPRATES AND SOMETIMES IT MAKES A LITTLE RAIN CRAFT
1300,IT EVAPORATES LESS THAN THE DESERT,IT IVAPPIRATES WLEST THAN A DOESERT
1301,WELL CAUSE WELL IT KINDA SLOWS IT DOWN CAUSE IT PUSHES THE WATER AWAY INSTEAD OF BRINGING IT NEARER FOR THE UM TEMPERATURE TO EVAPORATE,WELL CAUSE WELL IT COUNT SALLS IT DOWNCAUSE IT PUSHES THE WATER AWAY INSTEAD OF BRING IT NEARER FOR THE UHM TEMPERTURE TO THAPOR ATS
1302,GOOD THANK YOU,GOOD THANK YOU
1303,UM WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT EVAPORATION,I'MIVE EN WOARNING ABOUT A VPORATIION
1304,WHEN IT'S VERY COOL LIKE TWENTY TWO OR TWENTY DEGREES OR LOWER IT ONLY LOSES ZERO OR ONE MILLILITER,WIN ITS A VERY GOO WORKE TWENTY TWO OR TWENTY DEGREES  OR WOLER IT ONLY RUSES ZERO OR ONE MIDL LITER
1305,NO I'M TRYING TO SAY THAT MORE WATER EVAPORATES IN A DESERT THAN IT DOES IN A JUNGLE,N I'M TRYING TO SAY  MORE WATER ABAPPRATES IN A DESERT THAN A DOESINT THE JUNGLE
1306,WELL SINCE YOU YOU CAN MORE SEE THAT B C D UM THAT WELL THE HIGHER THE TEMPERATURE THE MORE WATER LOSS,WELL SINCE YU ORDOHM YOU CAN MORE SEED AT B S UHM THAT WELL THE HIRED TE TEMPEATURE THE MORE WATER LAWS
1307,THANK YOU MARNIE SHE'S,THANK YOU MONNY SHE'S
1308,WELL THAT'S WEIRD IT'S UM THE TEMPERATURE IS PLUS TWO FOR A AND B THEN IT'S MINUS FIVE FOR B AND C AND THEN IT'S MINUS TWO FOR D AND C,WELL THAT'S SWEET IT'S UHM DETEMPERATURE IS PLUSSED TOO FOR AAN B THEN IS MINE AST FIVE FURA BEAN C AND IN IT'S MINE AS TOO FOR DAN C
1309,WELL WE PUT EM IN DIFFERENT PLACES TO SEE IF THEY EVAPORATE FASTER,WIL WE PO IN  BOOM POITES TO SEE IF THEY A VAPPRATE FASTER
1310,WE PUT ONE UP HIGH WHICH IS IN THE CEILING WE PUT ONE BY A COMPUTER WHICH IS NEAR STATIC ELECTRICITY AND WE PUT ONE IN THE FRIDGE WHICH COULD BE HOT OR WARM OR COLD,E PUT ONE A PIHE WHICH IS IN HE SCELING WE PUT ONE BY A COMPUTER WHICH IS NE STAIC ALLECTRISSITY AND WE PUT ONE IN FRIDGE WHICH COULD BE HOT OR WARM OR COLD

1342,THANK YOU,THANK YOU
1343,IT GOES DOWN OR UM IT TAKES UP S A LOT OF SPACE,IT GOES DOWNOR UHM TAKES UP WEST SPACE
1344,WE PUT A THERMOMETER IN IT AND THEN IT TELLS YOU TEMPERATURE IF YOU WANT TO BE ROOM TEMPERATURE YOU LET IT STAY IN THE ROOM FOR A WHILE MAYBE A DAY,WILL YOU PUT I FOMMONNADER IN IT AND THEN IT TELLS YOU A TEMPERATURE IF YOU WANT TO BE ROOM T MPTURE YOU WOULDN'T STAY IN THA ROOM FOR A WHILE MAYBE ADAY
1345,THE TEMPERATURE BELOW IT IS HOT,A TEMPEATURE BELOW IT IS HOGHT
1346,IT'S ABOUT IF IT'S I THINK IT'S NOT TOO HOT NOT TOO COLD AND THAT WOULD BE ROOM TEMPERATURE WH AND IT'S RIGHT THERE IN THE MIDDLE TOO HOT WOULD BE TOO UP TOO COLD WOULD BE TOO DOWN YEAH,IT'S ABOUT IF IT'S I THINK IT'S NOT TOO HOT ANOT TO COLD AND THAT WOULD BE A ROOM TM PITCHERE AND IT'S RIGHT DARE IN THA MIDDLE TOO HOT IT WOULD BE TOO UP TOO COLD O BE TOO DOWNYES
1347,UM THANK YOU MARNIE CAN YOU SAY KITTY CATS,UHM THANK YOU MONEY CAN YOU SAY TO GET
1348,NO CAUSE I ALREADY KNEW ABOUT THE THERMOMETER SO I JUST THOUGHT THE THING WOULD BE THE SAME,NO BECAUSE I ALRADY KNEW BUT BUT THE PEMONETOR SO I JST WAT THE FING WOULD BE T SAING
1349,YOU ARE ABSOLUTELY POSITIVELY RIGHT,YOU ARE ABSOLLUTLY POSITIVELY RIGHT
1350,UM IT GOES DOWN LIKE YOU JUST SHOWED ME OR LOW LOW LOW LOW YES THAT WAS REALLY COOL,UHM IT GOES DOWN LIKE YOU JUST SHOW ME OUR P LOH OH WEH H YES THIT AS REE GOLD
1351,ME I THOUGHT IT WAS REALLY COOL,MEAN I FIGHT WITH ECUAL
1352,INSIDE THE TUBE IS REALLY WATER WITH GREEN FOOD COLORING BUT THEN IT GOES UP WITH HOT WATER DOWN WITH COLD YES,DECIDED TO GURE WATER WITH GREEN FOOD CAVRYING BUT DIDNT GOES UP WITH HAT WATER DOWN WITH COLD YES
1353,YES,YES
1354,UM WHEN YOU WANNA KNOW WHAT TEMPERATURE WILL BE OUTSIDE SO YOU CAN KNOW HOW TO DRESS,AND WHEN YOU WANT KNOW WHAT TIMPURE WILL BE OUTSIDE SO YOU CAN KNOW HOW TO TREST
1355,THANK YOU,DAN
1356,THAT TOO,THAT TOO
1357,MARNIE THIS IS JACKIE CAN YOU SAY SOMETHING PLEASE,MORNNY THIS IS SHACKY CAN YOU SAY SOMETHING PLEASE
1358,WELL SOIL ABSORBS WATER GRAVEL LETS IT GO THROUGH BUT SOMETIMES UM GRAVEL UM GETS WET BY WATER THAT'S MOST OF THE TIME WHAT HAPPENS,WELL SOEYR ABSORVES WATER GRABL LET'S IT GO THROUGH BUT SOMETIMES UHM GRAL UHM GETS WET BY OLER AS MOST OF TIME WAT HAPPENS
1359,IT HAS IT KEPT SOME INSIDE IT AND IT LET SOME OUT SO THAT WOULD BASICALLY DOUBLE THE MASS THE NORMAL MASS,IT HAD IT KEPT SOME INSIDE IT AND IT WET SOME OUT SO THAT WOULD BASEQULY DUBBLE THE MASSE THE NORMAL MASS
1360,THE WATER TO THE SOIL THE SOIL ABSORBED THE WATER,WAS TO TH SORD THE SOILE OBSORBED THE WATER
1361,IT'S ABOUT UM HOW THE SOIL CAN ABSORB BUT A LOT BUT THE UM GRAVEL CAN ABSORB VERY LITTLE,IS ABOUT UHM HOW A SOILR CAN OBSERVE BUT A LOT BUT THE UHM GRABBLE CAN OBSORBE VERY LITTLE
1362,COMES FROM US EXPERIMENTING IN THE CLASS,TCOMES FROM US EXPERIMENTAL IN THE CLASS
1363,I SEE TWO TRIANGULAR THINGS THEY'RE KIND OF LIKE UM CONES ONE IS SOIL AND ONE IS GRAVEL,I SEE TWO TRY ANGUAR FANG THET CAN RIKE UM CONES ONE A SOIL AND ONE AS GRAVVIL
1364,WE'VE BEEN UM WE'VE BEEN DOING STUFF WITH GRAVEL AND SOIL,E  H WE'VE BEEN DOING STUFF WITH GRAVIL AND SOIL
1365,GOOD THANK YOU,GOOD THANK YOU
1366,THANK YOU,ANKUM
1367,ORIGINALLY I THINK THEY CAME FROM UM WELL SOIL CAME FROM DIRT WHICH GOD INVENTED AND UM SAME THING WITH GRAVEL EXCEPT GRAVEL DID NOT COME FROM DIRT,RIGINALLY I FANK THER CAME FROM UHM SOIO CAME FROM DIRT WHICH GOD EMPANTED AND UHM SAMPNG OF CLABOOKS HIT GRADBIL DID NOT COME FROM DIRT
1368,WELL UM SOIL CAN HOLD MORE WATER CAUSE IT ABSORBS IT BUT GRAVEL CAN HOLD LESS WATER BECAUSE IT DOES NOT ABSORB IT,O I'M SURE YOU CAN HALD MORE WATER BECAUSE IT ABSORBS ITS BUT GRABL CAN ESH WATER BECAUSE IT DES NOT ABSORBIT
1369,I WATERED THE GRAVEL THE WATER JUST WENT THROUGH,I HAD WATER TO GRAVIL THE WATER JUST WENT THROUGH
1370,WELL SOMETIMES THE EARTH MATERIAL ABSORBS SOMETIMES THE WATER CAN GO THROUGH,SOMETIMES THE ORMAT ABSORBES SOMETIMES THE WATER CAN GO THROUGH
1371,WELL UM IT IS SHORTER THAN THE GRAVEL BECAUSE THE SOIL ABSORBS THE GRAVEL DOES NOT CAUSE THE GRAVEL IS SOLID THE SOIL IS VERY VERY SOFT,WELL UHM IT IS SHORTER THAN'T A GRAVIL BECAUSE THE SOIL OBSORBES THE GRABILE IS THAT BECAUSE THE GRABIL IS SOLID THE SOIL IS VERY VERY SOFT
1372,THAT UM THE UM GRAVEL ABSORBED ACTUALLY TEN MILLILITERS,DA HM THE UHM GRAAL ABSORBD DACORY TEN MILIATORS
1373,TO UM COMPLETE FURTHER EXPERIMENTS WITH BETTER EXPERIENCE,POT IT TO UHM COMPLEAT FARTHER EXPERIMENTS WITH BETTER EXPERIENCEE
1374,WELL MOST OF IT WENT THROUGH AND UM SOME OF IT STAYED ON THE ROCKS TO LIKE MAKE THE ROCKS WET WET AND YEAH THE REST WENT THROUGH,WELL MOST OF IT WENT THROUGH AND UHM SOME OF IT STAYED ON THE ROCKS SO LIKE MAKE THE WAX RET WET AND HE HAD THE WEST TO WINT FRUGH
1375,THE AMOUNT OF WATER THAT DRAINED THROUGH THE GRAVEL WAS LESS THAN THE IT WAS MORE THAN THE SOIL BECAUSE THE SOIL ABSORBS THE GRAVEL DOES NOT,THE AMOUNT OF WATER THAT DRANED FOOD A GRABBL WAS LESS THEN E  WAS MORE THAN THE SORYLE BECAUSE THE SORER OBSORBS THE GRABBALE DOES NOT
1376,WELL THE WATER DRAINAGE OF THE ROCKS REALLY DOESN'T MAKE THEM THAT HEAVY BECAUSE THEY'RE ALREADY HEAVY AND IT DID NOT ABSORB,WE THE WATER DRANIDGE OF THE ROCKS RAY DOESN'T MAKE THEM THAT HEAVY BECAUSE E AREREADY HEAVY AND E DO NOT ABSORB
1377,YOU PUT IT ON GRAVEL AND IT GOES THROUGH IT GO IT DOESN'T ABSORB ANYTHING,YHOU PUT ON GRAVI AIR IT GOES FOOD IT CAUSE IT DOESN'T ABSORB ANYTHANG
1378,THE HOT WATER IS LESS DENSE THAT IS WHAT IT TELLS ME,THE HOT WATER IS WEST THEN THAT IS WHAT IT TELLS ME
1379,UM I WOULD SAY IT GOES UP OR NORTH AND BECAUSE THE WATER PUSHES IT UP AND THAT SHOWS IT'S LESS DENSE,UHM I WOULD SAY IT GOES UP OR NORTH AN BECAUSE THE WATER PUSHES IT UP AND THAT SHOWS ITS WAST DENCE
1380,THEY FLOAT CAUSE THEY HAVE LESS DENSITY THAN THE WATER,THEY FLOAT CAUSE THEY HAVE ONE STENCIY TIN THE WATER
1381,WE'VE BEEN DOING WATER AND TODAY WE SAW THINGS FLOAT AND SINK ACTUALLY DIDN'T BUT WE PUT HOT WATER AND COLD WATER AND HOT WATER WENT TO THE TOP COLD WATER WENT TO THE BOTTOM CAUSE THEY PUT FOOD COLORING IN,WE'VE BEEN DOING WATER IN TODAY WE SAW THINGS FOATEAND THINK I SHOULD WE DIDNNA BUT WE BUT OUR WANT O COLD WATER AND AHO WIT OUR WENT TO S COLD WA WINT TO THE BOTTOM AS A PA F ITH COVEORIN AT
1382,GOOD BYE MARNIE,GOOD BYE MARNEY
1383,UM IT IS LESS DENSE,UHM IT IS RAST TMS
1384,THANK YOU,DANKU
1385,UM IT'S ABOUT THE DENSITY OF THE COLD WATER COMPARED TO THE DENSITY OF THE ROOM TEMPERATURE WATER,UHM IT'S ABOUT THE DENCITY OF THE COLD WATER COMPARED TO THE DENCITY OF THE ROOM TEMPERATURE OF WATER
1386,SOME OF THEM WILL FLOAT SOME OF THEM WOULD NOT THAT'S WHAT WHAT WE WERE TRYING TO DO ACTUALLY WE WERE JUST DOING HOT WATER COLD WATER,SOME OF THEM I FOAKS SOME OF BUN WOURE NOT THAT'S WHAT WHL WE WERE TRYING TO DO AFTER WERE JUST O AND HAT WAT ERN COLD WATER
1387,UM THAT THEY ARE MORE DENSE THAN THE WATER,M THAT THEY ARE MORE DANCED IN WATER
1388,UM IT TOLD ME THAT THE COLD THE CORK UM WAS LESS DENSE THAN THE WATER WHICH I DID NOT KNOW,UHM IT TOLD ME TAT THE COATE THE CORK UHM WAS LESS DENCED THAN THE WATER WHICH I DID NOT KNOW
1389,THE COLD WATER UM THE COLD WATER IS UM IN THERE AND THE COLD WATER IS ACTUALLY MORE DENSE SO IT IS FLOATING TO THE BOTTOM AND CAN GOING ALL AROUND TOO,THE COLD WATER UHM THE COLD WATER IS UH AND THRE AND THE COLD WATER IS ACTALLY MORE DEMP IS FOTIN TO THE BUTTOM AND CAN GOL AROUND TO
1390,WELL THEY'RE ALL ABOUT DENSITY AND WHICH ONES ARE LESS DENSE AND MORE DENSE,WID R ABOUT DENCITY AND WHICH WANT O RESTIS AND MORE DENCE
1391,M THAT UM NOT ALL OF A LOT OF THE RED WATER FLOATED TO THE TOP BUT NOT ALL OF IT BE YOU HAVE TO EVEN A VIAL KIND OF FLOATED TO THE TOP WHEN IT WAS DONE,M AND THAT UHM NOT ALL OF A WATER OF THE RED WAT ER FORDED TA JOP BUT NOT ALL OF IT BAC SHE EVEN A VIL KIND OF OTED TO THE TOP WHEN IT WAS DONE
1392,UM IT SINKS AND IT SOMETIMES ALSO GOES DOWN AND SPREADS,UHM IT'S SANKS AND IT SOMETIMES ALBSTIGOLES DOWN AIND SPREADS
1393,IT MEANS TO HAVE THE THINGS FLOAT INSTEAD OF MEANS UM LIKE THEY WILL SINK CAUSE THEY'RE MORE DENSE THAN THE WATER,IT MEANS TO HAVE TO OAT INSTEAD OF WANTS MEANS UHM BUK THEY WILL SINK CASE ARE MORE DENCE IN THE WATER
1394,UH UM HOT WATER WAS MORE DENSE I MEAN LESS DENSE THAN THE COLD I MEAN THAN THE ROOM TEMPERATURE WATER,UHM V HOT WATER WAS MORE DENC I MEAN LESST DENCE THAN THE COD I MEAN DIN A ROOM TEPITURE WATER
1395,THEY ARE BOTH LESS DENSE AND THEY ARE BOTH BOTH HAVE THE SAME DENSITY,THEY ARE BOTH LESS DENCE AND DB THE SAME DENCITY
1396,THAT THEY UM WOULD THAT THEY ARE LIGHTER THAN THAT THEY ARE LIGHTER THAN THE UH LESS DENSE THAN THE WATER,THE DAY UHM WOULD THAT THEY ARE WHITER THAN THAT THEYARE WHITER THAN THE  WEST DEN THEN THEWATER
1397,TRUE,DREW
1398,IT IS ABOUT UM HOW COLD WATER IS MORE DENSE THAN ROOM TEMPERATURE WATER YEAH COLD WATER IS MORE DENSE THAN ROOM TEMPERATURE WATER,IT IS A B UHM HO COLD WATER IS MORE DENCE THAN IN ROOM TEMPERATURE WATER YAH COLD WATER'S MORE DENCE THAN ROOM TEMPERTURE WATER
1399,UM THEY UM THEY ARE SINKING BECAUSE THEY ARE MORE DENSE THAN THE WATER,UHM THEY UHM THEY ARE SINKING BECAUSE THEY ARE MORE DENC TIN THE WATER
1400,THE RED WATER IS FLOATING OUT OF THE VIAL BECAUSE IT IS LESS DENSE THEREFORE IT FLOATS TO THE TOP WHY CAN'T,THE RED WATER IS FLOTING OUT OF THE VILE BECAUSE IT IS LESTENCED THERE FORE IT FOR TO THE TOP I GET
1401,A GOOD THANK YOU,GOOD THANK YOU
1402,THEY STAY ON THE BOTTOM OF THE CUP BECAUSE UM THEY UM ARE MORE DENSE THAN THE WATER SO YEAH IT ALL IS UM IT ALL SOMEHOW CONNECTS TO DENSITY,THEY SIT ON TA BOTTOM OF THE CUP BECAUSE UHM THAY UHM HM MORE DENCED IN THE WATER SO YEAH IT ALL IS UHM T O SOMEHOW CONNECTED TO DENCITY
1403,IT'S EXPOSED TO AIR WHICH CO WHICH IS EVAPORATING IT,S EXPOSED TO AIR WHICH WHICH IS A VAPPADING IT
1404,THE HOT AIR,D HOLLR
1405,IN THE WIDER CUP CAUSE IT HAS MORE IT HAS A MORE OF A WAY TO EVAPORATE,IN THE WIDER CUP CAUSE IT OES MORE IT HAS A MORALBL WAY TO AVAPPERATE
1406,YES,YES
1407,UM HOW BIG OR ROUND THE SURFACE AREA IS,UH HOW BIG ORE ROUND A CURFACE AREA IS
1408,WELL UH YEAH THEY ALL LOST HALF AS I THOUGHT,WELL OH THEYR THEY ALL LOST HALF AS I THOUGHT
1409,GO GOOD THANK YOU,GOOD GOOD DANKYOU
1410,B IS ONE HUNDRED BUT C BUT A IS SIXTEEN BUT THERE STILL THE SAME AMOUNT OF WATER,WELL UHM YOU CAN ROL OVER THEM AND YOU CANSEE THAT Z IS TWO HUNDRED SQUARE SAID THE MITARS C IS TWENTY FOUR
1411,UM THEY ARE ALL UM YEAH THEY ALL UH THEY ALL HAVE THE SAME AMOUNT OF WATER JUST IN DIFFERENT CASES,UHM THEY 'RE ALL UHM YEAH THEY ALL UHM THEY 'LL HAVE TO SAME THAM OUT OF WATER  JUST IN DIFFERENT CASES
1412,THE WATER ON THE SURFACE IS TOUCHING UM THE SIDE OF THE CONTAINER,THE WATER ON THE SURFASCE IS TOUCHING UHM THE SIDE OF THE CONTAINER
1413,EACH ONE LOSES HALF,EACH ONE MOSES HALF
1414,THIS AREA IS THE AREA OF THE WATER,AAREA I THE AA OF THE WATER
1415,UM I'VE BEEN UM DOING EVAPORATION AND TODAY WAS THE SECOND DAY OF WHERE WE PUT STUFF IN PLACES LIKE THE REFRIGERATOR THE CEILING THE WINDOW SILL THE CORTEC COMPUTER,UHM I'VE BEEN UHM THRUN A APPIRBATION AND IT SAID AY WAS A SECOND DAY I WHERE WE PUT STOFF AND BICES LIK THE REERDURATOR TO SEALING THE WINDOW SAILED A CORTTAC COMPUTER
1416,IT'S ABOUT HOW WIDE THE THING IS IT WAS JUST HALF BECAUSE IT'S SO WIDE AND AVAILABLE TO BE EVAPORATED,IT'S ABOUT HOW WHY TO FANG IS IT WAS IS HALF BECAUSE ISO WHIDE AND AVAILABLE TO BE AVAPIRATED
1417,TWO HUNDRED SQUARE CENTIMETERS,TO LARN DISCORSE AND MATORS
1418,WELL THE HOTTER THE ROOM AND THE WIDER THE SURFACE AREA THE MORE IS EVAPORATING,WEL TEY HERED A ROOM AND THE WHIDER IT SURFACE ARA THE MORE IS THE BAARADID
1419,GOOD THANK YOU,GOOD THAN'K YOU
1420,T THE PAPER TOWEL GOT WET AND SOON THE WATER WAS GONE BUT YOU COULD SEE THAT IT HAD TAKEN THE WATER INTO ITS MATERIAL,WHIN THE PAPER TOWAL GOT WET AND SOON THE WATER WAS GONE BUT YOU COULD SEE THAT IT HAD TAKEN AWATER IN TO ITS MATERIAL
1421,UM WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT WATER AND UM DOING LOTS OF FUN EXPERIMENTS AND AND WE'VE PLAYED WITH NORMAL AND SOAPY AND EVEN SALT WATER,UHM WE'VE BEEN WARNING ABOUT WATER AND UHM DOING LOTS OF FUN EXPERIMENTS A AND WE'VE BED WITH NORML AND SOPY AND EVEN SALTWATER
1422,JUST A SPOT OF WATER BUT IF UM BUT AS IT I PUT MORE DROPS AND IT LOOKED STARTED TO LOOK LIKE A DOME,JUST A SPOT OF WATER BUT IT'S UHM BUT AS IT I PUT MORE DROPS WHEN IT WOOKED STARTED TO LOOK LIKE A DOME
1423,YES IT WAS REALLY INTERESTING TO DO THAT AND LEARN ALL ABOUT THE AND YOU LEARNED SOME ABOUT WATER THAT I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW,YES IT WAS REALLY INTERESTING TODUTAT AND WERN'T ALL ABOUT THE AND WOARD THOME ABOUT WHATTER DID I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW
1424,YOU HAVE TO TILT THE PAPER AND SOMETIMES IT DOESN'T WORK EVENTUALLY IF YOU TILT IT ENOUGH IT DOES,YOU HAVE TO TILT THE PAPER AND SOMETIMES IT DOESN'T WORK BVINTALL IF UD O  ENOUGH IT DOES
1425,THANK YOU YOU ARE VERY KIND,THANK YOU YOU'RE HERE VERY KIND
1426,BECAUSE THE ALL THE UM DROPS OF WATER I THINK THEY GO TOGETHER AND JUST THEY MAKE THAT SHAPE AND CAUSE IT'S A CERTAIN MATERIAL IT DOESN'T JUST FALL FLAT,BECAUSE T OLD UHM DROPS OF WATER I THINK THEY GO TOGETHER AND JUST TO MAKE THAT SHAPE AND CAUSE IT'S HERT A MATERIL ORIT DOESN'T JUST FALL FAT
1427,WATER TENSION IS THE THING THAT MAKES IT SHAPE LIKE ANYTHING IT WANTS TO BE LIKE,WHAT ATTENTION IS THE FAING THAT MAKES IT SHAPE LIKE ANYTHING IT WANTS TO BE LIKE
1428,IT I MEANT BY LIKE WHAT AS WHEN YOU PUT IN MORE DROPS ON THE UM SOAPY WATER IT CAN HOLD LESS THAN A PENNY CAN HOLD WITH NORMAL WATER,IT I MEBY WRK IW AS WHEN YOU PUT MORE DROPS ON  UHM SOAPY WATER IT CAN HOLD EST THAN A PENDY CAN HOLD ITH NORMAL WATER
1429,IT LOOKS LIKE A TEAR DROP,IT LOOKS LIKE A TEARJROP
1430,SO THE PUDDLE WAS SO COOL IT WAS JUST LIKE A DOME WHICH I BELIEVE IS THE SCIENTIFIC TERM FOR SOMETHING,SO THE PUDDLE WAS SO COOL IT WAS JUST LIKE A DONE WHICH I BELWLIEVE IT'S A SIENTIFIC TURM FOR SOMETHING
1431,BYE SHE'S,BY HE
1432,GOOD THANK YOU,GOOD THANK YOU
1433,IT GOES UP INTO THE AIR,IT GOES UP INTO THE AIR
1434,UM OH WAIT SORRY I,PLEASE REPEAT WAIHT SORRY I
1435,M COLD COLD WATER,N COLD COLDWATER
1436,WELL UM IN ONE IT'S COLD WATER WHICH CAUSES SURFACE TENSION TO BREAK AND UH WATER VAPOR TO BE SEEN THEN EVENTUALLY GOES UP TO AIR AND TURNS INTO WHAT IT WAS,WELL UHM IN HONE IT'S CALLED WATER WHICH CAUSE HIS CERVIUSE TTENTION TO BREAK IN A WATER VAPER TO BE SEEN THEN  THEN SHE GOES UP TO  AND TURNS INTO WHAT IT WAS
1437,WELL WE'VE BEEN DOING CONDENSATION AND EVAPORA AND THEN MOSTLY CONDENSATION BUT A LITTLE BIT OF EVAPORATION,WELLE WE'VE BEEN DOING CONDEMSATION AND EVBOR ATE AND THEN MOST CONVASATION BUT A LITTLE BIT OF AVAPPIRATION
1438,UM WELL SOME THING'S THAT EVAPORATE ARE WATER AND WATER HOT WATER COLD WATER ANY KIND OF WATER,UHM AS SOMETHINGS OUT OF VABRATE R WATER AND WATER HA WATER ICALED WATER ANY KIND OF WATER
1439,ALL ABOUT THE WIND CARRYING THE WATER IN THE AIR TO DIFFERENT PLACES,ALL ABOUT THE WINDS CARRYING THE WATER IN THE AIR TO DIFFERENT PLACES
1440,LIKE A BIG LAKE OR YEAH BIG LAKE AND WET,BRAK A BIG LAKE OR YU HADA BIG LAKE AND WET
1441,K PEOPLE MAKE CONDENSATION CHAMBERS TO SEE IF CONDENSATION HAPPENS IN THE CHAMBER,PEOPLE MAKE CONDENSATION CHAMBERS TO SEE  CONVERSATION HAPPENS IN THE CHAMBER
1442,UM WATER EVAPORATES AND HOT WATER AND COLD WATER EVAPORATES TOO WELL THAT'S STILL WATER BUT YEAH,UHM WATER VAPERATES AND WATER AND COLD WATER ITVAPIRATES TO ORESE TO WATER BUT YEAH
1443,T TRUE,TRE
1444,AIR,AIR
1445,TRUE,TREW
1446,WATER DROPLETS FORM AT WHATEVER PART HAS SPACE THEY GET SEPARATED INTO LITTLE LITTLE LITTLE ONES MAKE REALLY BIG A REALLY BIG ONE,WATER DROP HATS FARM HAT WHATEVER PART HAS SPACE THINK NS TIPPER AN TO WHED WID RIDDLE ONES ITMAKE REALLY BIT A VERY BIG ONE
1447,GOOD,GOOD
1448,UM IT'S KIND OF LIKE THE VAPOR VERSION OF WATER,ITKLIKE DE VAPE PEVERSION OF WATER
1449,ELEVEN TWENTY FOUR SEE ONE ONE TWO FOUR CONNECTION LOST PRESS OKAY AND WAIT FOR MARNIE OKAY,T I FIT ALL ABOUT HOW A WATER VAPR SNEAKEDIN AND NOW YOU CAN SEE WANT VAPR WIT THE BUBBLES OF AIR WHAT WOOK LIKE AIR ANYWAY
1450,TRUE,TREW
1451,WELL CONDENSATION,BOUT CONVENSATION
1452,UM IT'S LIKE LITTLE CIRCLES BUT WHEN IT GOES ON THE HOT SURFACE YOU CAN ACTUALLY SEE IT AND WHEN YOU TOUCH IT IT BECOMES LITTLE DROPLETS LIKE LITTLE RAIN DROPS TEARS THAT KIND OF THING,UHM IT'S LIKE WIDOW CIRCLES BUT WHEN IT GOES ON HOTIVUSE YOU CAN ATTRA SEE IT AND WHEN YOU TOUCH IT IT BECOMES SWIDOW DROP WHATLIKE WIDOT RAIN DROPS TEARS LIKE IND OF FHANG
1453,UM IT WAS ABOUT SEEING IF CONDENSATION HAPPENED IN THE CHAMBER,UHM IT WAS ABOUT SEENE OF CONVECATO AN HAPPENED IN THE CHAMBER I S  I D
1454,HELLO MY UM,HELWOLL MY HN
1455,YEAH WELL IT'S NOT THAT LOUD,YEAH IT WELL AT'S NOT THAT LOUD
1456,MMM THEY ATTRACT TO ANY PIECE WITH WELL IT DEPENDS WITH ANY PIECE WITH IRON IF THEY HAVE IRON IN IT BECAUSE THERE'S A MINUS AND A PLUS SIDE,THEY TRICK TO ANY PIECE WIRTH WELL DE PENDS WITH ANY PIECE WITH IRON IF THEY HAVE IRON ET BECAUSE THERE'S A MINURS AND A PLUSSIDE
1457,YEAH AND IT'S A LOT OF COM IT'S PRETTY COMPLICATED,EH AND LOT IT'S PRETTY COMPLICATED
1458,THE IT IT DOESN'T WORK DOESN'T IT IT JUST DOESN'T DO ANYTHING IT JUST STAYS WHERE IT IS,THE IT IT DOESN'T WORK IT DOESN'T IT IT JUST DOESN'T DO ANYTHING JUSTYS WR IT IS
1459,THE SWITCH I JUST HAVE TO HIT IT,THE SWISH I JUST HAVE TO HIT
1460,CAUSE WE DON'T HAVE STRONG ENOUGH BATTERIES WE JUST USE D CELL BATTERIES,CAUSE WE DON'T HAVE STRONG ENOUGH BATTERIES WE JUST USED TE SELW BATERIES
1461,JUST THAT THE POWER WAS STRONGER AND,JUST THAT THE POWER WIS STRONGER AN
1462,THEY JUST PUSH IT FORWARD BUT THERE'S LIKE THIS MAGNETIC FIELD IN IT THAT'S BLOCKING IT AND JUST PUSHING IT OUT BUT THEN WHEN YOU CLAMP IT JUST AND THEN YOU LET GO IT JUST FLIES OUT,THE JUST PUSH IT FORD BUD THERT'S LIKE THIS MAGNET FELED IN IT THAT'S BLOCKING IT AD JUST PUSHING IT OUT BUT THEN O I NI CLAMP INJUST AND THEN HO LET'S GO JUST FLIES OUT
1463,A THE REPELLING,AR THE REPELLIN
1464,Y Y IF ONE OF IT HAS IRON IN IT YES,IF ONE OF IT HAS IRN IN IT YES
1465,THEN THE ELECTRICITY IS BROKEN A CIRCUIT,THERE IN THE LECTRISCITY IS BROKEN A CIRCUTE
1466,MMM YEAH,YEAH
1467,UM THE BATTERY WAS JUST GIVING THE ELECTRICITY AND POWER FOR IT TO FLOW THROUGH AND THEN YEAH DO IT MAKE A CIRCUIT AND THEN MAKE ALSO A MAGNET AT THE SAME TIME,UHM THE BATTERY WAS JUS GIVING THE LECTRISITYI POWUER FOR IT TO FLOWT THROUGH AND THEN YEAH DO IT MAKE A CIRCUTE AND THEN AT MAKE ALSO A MAGNET AT THE SAME TIME
1468,UM IF YOU TURNED IT WELL THE SWITCH CAN ACTUALLY TELEGRAPH THE THING YOU HAVE TO TAKE THE UM SWITCH AND HIT IT AGAINST THE METAL PART,UHM IF YOU TURNED IT  WELL THE SWISH TO ACTUALLY TELL EIGRAFD THE THING YOU HAD TO TAKE IT UHM SWISH AND HATED AGAINST THE MEDDAL PART
1469,MAGNETIC F MAGNETIC FORCE UH I IT UM IF THE NOTHER MAGNET THEN YOU CAN ATTACH LIKE NOT JUST BE ATTRACTED AND,MAGNET MAGNETIC FORCE UHIT UHM IF THERS ANOTHER MAGNET THEN YOU CAN ATTATCH MI NOESEBE ATTRACTED AND
1470,UH JUST LIKE ONE CENTIMETER AWAY FROM YOU,UH JUST LIKE ONECE SENT A METO AWAY FROM MUT
1471,IT WOULD LIKE FROM FAR AWAY LIKE IF YOU PUT THE METAL BAR FAR AWAY THEN IT WILL CON STILL DO IT AND THEN YOU CAN SHOW HOW HOW STRONG IT IS,IT LIKE FROM FAR AWAYV LIKE IF YOU PUT THE MEDDAL BAR FAR AWAY THEN ITL CAN STILL DO IT AND THEN YOU CAN SHOW HHOW STRONG IT IS
1472,IT'S A PATHWAY FOR ELECTRICITY,IT'S A PATHWAY FOR ALECTRISSITY
1473,A,
1474,SO SO WHEN YOU KEPT HITTING THE THING WITH THE BAR THAT ON THE SWITCH THEN THE THERE'S THIS BAR HERE THAT WAS HITTING ON THE RIVET,SO SO WHEN YOU KEPT DITTING THE THING WITH THE BAR THAT ON THE SWISH THEN THE THEREWAS THE SBAR HERE THAT WAS HIDTTING ON THE RIVER
1475,YEAH,YA
1476,THEN IT HITS IT BUT THEN IT STICKS SO THAT'S WHY YOU HAVE TO HIT IT BACK AND FORTH REALLY QUICK,THEM IT HITS IT BUTE THAN IT STICKS SO THAT'S WHY I HAVE TO HIT IT BACK IN FORTH RO LIK
1477,PAPER WELL PAPER CLIPS DO WORK BUT PAPER CLIPS AND PAPER CLIPS DON'T STICK TOGETHER,PAPER WELL PAPER CLIPS DO WORK BUT PAPER CLIPS IN PAPER CLIPS DON'T STICK TOGETHER
1478,THEY'RE INSIDE THE WIRES THE ELECTRICITY IS FLOWING,THERE INSCIDE THE WIRES ELECTRISTITY IS FLOWING
1479,ME MAYBE POSSIBLY YEAH,E MAYBE POSSIBALLY
1480,NO,N
1481,TH THEY WOULD JUST BEING USED,THEY WERE JUST BEING USED
1482,IT MAKES THE BAR HIT AGAINST THE RIVET,IT MAKES THE BAR HIT AGAINST THE RIVER
1483,YEAH,AH
1484,YEAH IT'S A MAGNET BUT THE MAGNET WAS USED TO ALSO MAKE UM THE TALKING CLICKS,YEAH IT'S A MAGNET BUT THE MAGNET WAS USED ALSO MAKE UHM THEIRE TALKING CLICKS
1485,NORTH AND NORTH WON'T ATTRACT SOUTH AND SOUTH WON'T ATTRACT I THINK,NORT E NORTH WON'T ATTRACT SOUTAN SOUTHM TRAP I THINK
1486,THE ELECTRICITY DID SOMETHING TO IT,THE ELECTRISSCITY DID SOMETHING TO
1487,YEAH YEAH,VIA
1488,WELL WITH OTHER EXPERIENCE WE DID IT,WELL WITH NOTHER EXPERIENCE WE DID IT
1489,YEAH THE ELECTRICITY WAS F FING JUMPING,E THE LECTRISCITY WAS ETHING JUMPING
1490,UM SOUTH AND NORTH WOULD ATTRACT,UHM SOUTH E NORTH WOULD ATRACT
1491,YEP,HIP
1492,DO,TO
1493,YEP,E
1494,YOU COULDN'T IT JUST SCREW IT JUST JUST RICOCHETS OFF IT IT DOESN'T STAY,YOU COULDN'T JUST GO  JUST JUST LICKER SHAES OFF IT DOESN'T STAY
1495,IN FIVE WIRES,IN FIVE WIRES
1496,YEAH,VIA
1497,YEAH BUT IT ALSO WORKED AS A TELEGRAPH THING,YAH BUT IT ALSO WORKED AS THE TEGRAFFTHING
1498,UH NOPE,NO
1499,YEAH SO IT JUST CUTTING THE CIRCUIT,EAH SO I'EJUST CUTTING THE CIRCT
1500,THE NEGATIVE AND THE A UWE WELL WE SHOULD JUST SAY NORTH AND SOUTH,THE NEGOTIVE AND THE AN WHAT WE SHOULD JUST SAY NORTHAN SOUT
1501,YEAH,YEAR
1502,I JUST FELT IT AS I DON'T KNOW JUST MORE ELECTRICITY AND,I JUST FELT IT AS OH KNO JUST MORELECTRISSITY AND
1503,THE BAR THAT HITS THE RIVET,THE BAR THAT HITS THE RIVER
1504,NOPE,NOTE
1505,S BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT WORKS THE BEST,S BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT WORKS THE BEST
1506,YEAH,YEAH
1507,O TH WELL THE DREDGE BAR OR THE BAR THAT HITS THE RIVET,WE THE BRIDGE BAR OF THE BAR THAT HITS THE RIVERN
1508,METAL,MEDDALE
1509,UM YOU CAN S S FLIP THE RIB RIVET AROUND AND THEN SEE IF IT WORKS,UHM YOU CAN S SPLIP THE RIB RIBIT AROUND AND THEN SEE IF IT WORKS
1510,MAYBE I DON'T REALLY KNOW,MAYBE I DON'T REALLY KNOW
1511,UH WE HAD A GROUP AND THE WE TALKED WITHIN EACH OTHER,UH WE HAD A GROUP AND THEN WE TALKED WITH IN EACH OTHER
1512,NO WE ALL USED THE SAME THING,KNOW WE ALL USE THE SAME THING
1513,YOU CAN DO A MANUAL ONE WHICH YOU JUST TAKE TH THE BUTTON AND THEN JUST FLICK IT AND JUST CA E CA DO THE CLICKING THING,YOU CAN DO A MANUAL WORN WHICH YOU JUST TAKE THEIR BARN AND JUST FLICK IT AND DUS AND C DO A CLICKING THING
1514,IT WOULD BE A LOT MORE POWERFUL,IT W'L BE A LOT MORE POWRFUL
1515,THE ELECTROMAG YEAH,THE CHM YEAH
1516,THE BAR IRON SOME SORT OF METAL THAT MAGNETS LIKE AND THAT STUFF THAT ATTRACT LIKE,THE BAR ION SOME SORT OF MEDDAL THAT MAGNETS LIKE AN THAT STUFFED AT A TRACK LIKE
1517,THE BUT WHAT THE PROBLEM IS IS THAT WE ONLY HAD JUST THREE WIRES SO WE CAN'T USE THREE WIRES TO A TO ATTACH TWO BATTERIES TO THE SWITCH,BUT WHEN THE PROBLEM IS S THAT WE ONLY HAD JUST THREE WIRE SO WE CAN'T USE THREE WISE TO ATO ATTATCH TWO BATRIES TO THE SWISH
1518,THE PLUS SIDE IS THE POSITIVE AND THE MINUS SIDE IS THE NEGATIVE SIDE,THE PLE IS THE POSITIVE RENDER MINOSIDE IS THE NEGGOTIVE TN
1519,MMM YES BECAUSE IF THE POSITIVE SIDE DOES NOT TOUCH THE BOTTOM AND THE NEGATIVE SIDE DOESN'T TOUCH THE SIDE IT IT WON'T TURN ON,YES BECAUSE IF THE POSITTIVE SIDE DOES NOT TOUCH THE BOTTOM AND THE NEGGTIVE SIDE DOESN'T TOUCH THE SIDE I IT WON'T TURN ON
1520,OKAY,OK
1521,AFTER THAT THE THE LIGHT BULB LIGHTS UP,AFTER THAT THE THE RAD POBLIE UP
1522,THE ELECTRICITY MOVES THROUGH THE WIRE AND INTO THE LIGHT BULB,THE ALECTRISITY MOVES THROUGH THE WIRE AND INTO THE LIG BUHMP
1523,YES,YES
1524,YES THEY'RE IMPORTANT,YES THERE IMPORTANT
1525,I THINK IT'S ABOUT THE JUST BOTH SIDES HAVE TO TOUCH THE LIGHT BULB SOME,I SHEENK IT'S ABOUT THE JUST BOTH SIDES HAVE TO TOUCH THE LIGHT BOB SOMEWAY
1526,YOU CAN USE TWO WIRES AND CONNECT EACH WIRE TO ONE OF THE SIDES TO THE NEGATIVE AND POSITIVE AND CONNECT BOTH WIRES TO THE LIGHT BULB,YOU CAN USE TWO WIRES AND CONECT EACH WIER TO ONE IN THE SAD TO THE NEGGOTIV POSITIVE AND CONECT BOTH WIRES TO THE LIGHE BUMB
1527,THE WIRES AND THE BATTERY DIDN'T LIGHT THE LIGHT BULB BECAUSE BECAUSE THEY WEREN'T IN THE RIGHT PLACES,THE WIRES AND THE BETTER DIDN'T LIGKE THE LIGHT BOB BECAUSE BECAUSE THEY WERE IN THE RIGHT PLACES
1528,YES IT DIDN'T LIGHT THE LIGHT BULB,YES IT DIDN'T LIGHT THE LIGHBARE
1529,THEY'RE IMPORTANT BECAUSE WITHOUT THE NEGATIVE OR POSITIVE SIDE THE LIGHT BULB CAN'T LIGHT LIGHT UP,THER IMPORTENT BECAUSE WITHOUT THE NEGOTIVE WERE APOSITIVSIDE THE LGHE POB CANT LIGHT LIGHT UP
1530,THE TWO LINE IS THE D CELL AND THE SWIRLY THINGS ARE THE LIGHT BULBS,THE TWO LINE IS THE D SELLAN THE SRARLY THING FAR THE NEPPALDS
1531,NO,NO
1532,GOOD,GOOD
1533,HERE IS SHOWING WHERE WHERE EACH OF THE WHERE THE ELECTRICITY IS FLOWING THROUGH,HERE IS SHOWING WHERE WHERE EACH OF THE WHERE THE LECTRICITY IS FLOYING THROUGH
1534,THE GREEN LIGHT MIGHT CONNECT TO IT BY UM EACH BY IT SHOWS WHICH CIRCUIT IS WHICH,THE CREANA MY CONECT B EACH BY SHOWS WHICH CURC IS WHICH
1535,BY TOUCHING I MEAN THE WIRES ARE ALWAYS CONNECTING TO EACH OTHER,A TOUCHING I MEAN THAT THEIR WIRS ARE ALWAYS CONNECTING TO EACH OTHER
1536,I SEE TWO PATHWAYS,I SEE TO PATHWAYS
1537,THE OTHER PICTURE THE PATHWAYS THERE WAS TWO PATHWAYS AND IN THIS ONE THERE IS TWO OTHER PATHWAYS,THE OTHER PICTURE THER PASTH WAYS THERE WAS TWO PATHWAYS AND IN THIS WEN THERE S TWO OTHER PETHRES
1538,MMM SOME TYPE OF CIRCUITS CIRCUITS ONLY HAVE ONE WAY FOR THE ELECTRICITY TO FLOW THROUGH AND SOME OF THE ONES HAVE TWO WAYS OR MORE,SOME TIPE OF CIRC CIRCUTS ONLY HAVE ONE WAY FOR THE LITURETURTY TO FLOW THRUGH AND SOME OTHER ONES HAVETWO WAYS OR MORE
1539,IN THE OTHER PICTURE THE ENERGY OF THE BATTERY WAS GOING TO TWO DIFFERENT TO TWO DIFFERENT LIGHT BULBS,IND TE PICTURE THENORDE THE BETTER WAS GOING TO TO DIFFERENT TO TWO DIFFERENT AT BUMS
1540,YES WE DID,YES MI DEA
1541,AND THE FLOW ALWAYS UM ALWAYS GOES RIGHT BACK TO THE BATTERY,AT THE FLOW ALWAYS UM ALWAYS GOES RIGHT BACK TO BATTERY
1542,NO,NO
1543,THE PARALLEL CIRCUITS UM HA HAVE ALWAYS HAVE MORE THAN TWO WAYS FOR FOR THE EL,PERLO TURCE HM HO ALWAYS HAVE MORE THAN TWO WA FOR FOR THE
1544,IN PARALLEL CIRCUITS THE PATHWAYS THERE IS ALWAYS TWO OR MORE,UNPLO SHICKETS THE PATH WAYS THERE 'S A WAY TWO ORD MORE
1545,THE DIRECTION OF THE FLOW ALWAYS GOES TO ONE LIGHT BULB AND THEN TO ANOTHER,THE DIRECTION OF THE FLOT ALWAYS GOES TO ONE LIKE BOB AND THEN TO ANOTHER
1546,MMM I DON'T KNOW,I DON'T KNOW
1547,WE HAVE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT DIFFERENT KIND TYPES OF CIRCUIT,WE HAVE BEEN LERNING ABOUT DIFFERENT C TYPES OF CURCAY
1548,A CIRCUIT IS UM A OPEN CIRCUIT IS IF IT HAS A HOLE,A TURCAY IS A A OPEN TURCATE IS IF IT HAS A H
1549,GOOD I GUESS,GOOD I GUESS
1550,IF IT'S AN OPEN CIRCUIT THEN IT WON'T THE BATTERY WON'T GIVE ENERGY TO THE TO THE MOTOR,IF IT'S AN OPEN CIRCEY AND I WA'T THE MATTER  WON'T GIVE ENERGY TO THE TO THEMOTER
1551,THE RECEIVER'S WHAT TAKES THE ENERGY AND THE WIRE'S ARE WHAT TAKES THE ENERGY TO IT AND THE BATTERY IS WHAT GIVES THE WIRES THE ENERGY TO TAKE TO THE RECEIVER,RECEVER IS WA TAKES THE ENERGY AND THE WIRES HEART WHAT TAKES THE ENERGY TO IT AND THE PETTER IS WHAT GIVES THE WIRES THE ENEGY TO TAKE TO THE RECEVER
1552,CIRCUIT ARE LIKE ARE LIKE I THINK PAPER CLIPS AND AND OTHER KINDS OF METAL,THE PONC OF A CIRCUT AR LA  I THINK PAPER CLOPS AND AND KIND OF METAL
1553,I DISCOVERED THAT ONLY METAL ANY KIND OF METAL COULD COULD COULD MAKE THE MOTOR WORK,I DISCOVERED THAT ONLY METAL ANY KIND OF MEDTAL CU CU COULD MAKE THE MATER MARK
1554,THE THE METAL CAN PICK UP THE WASHERS,THE THE MIDDALE CAN PICK UP THE WASHES

2460,FROM BULBS OUT,FLIMBOS OUT
2461,ONE'S BURNED OUT AND ONE'S STILL PERFECTLY GOOD IT IT'S JUST SHUT OFF PLUS THE ENERGY ISN'T FLOWING THROUGH,ONES BURNT OUT IN ONE STILL PERFECTLY GOOD IXS JUST SHUT OFF PLASTI ENERGYS THANT FLUNG THROUGH
2462,IT'S ENERGY WELL IF CLICK ON,IT'S ENERGY OWELL IF YOU CLICK U
2463,IF ONE GETS OFF THE OTHER ONE GETS BRIGHTER,IT FULDN'T GETS OFF THE OTHER ONE GETS PRIGHTER
2464,IT,I
2465,PARALLEL CIRCUIT,HAT WELL A CIRCUET
2466,THE ENERGY FLOWS JUST ONE WAY,ENERGY FLOWS JUST ONE WAY
2467,RING,IN
2468,IF A WHITE BULB GE RUNS OUT THAT MEANS THE OTHER ONE'S GETTING BRIGHTER,IF HA LYBOLB G RUNS OUT THAT MEANS THE OTHER ONES GETTING BRIGHTER
2469,IF ONE BULB BURNS OUT IT THE FILAMENT IS BROKEN,H FLIMBL BURNDS OUT IT THE FILLMENT IS BROKEN
2470,THE OTHER ONE STILL LIGHTS UP BUT GETS WAY BRIGHTER,THE OTHER ONE STILL LIGHTS UP BUT GETS WAY BRIGHTER
2471,IF,IF
2472,UM THE OTHER,TYA
2473,THE FILAMENT POWERS THE BULB SO IF IT BURNS OUT THE FILAMENT WILL BREAK,D FILL IM IT POWURS THE BOLL I SO IF IT BURNS OUT TO FILL MENT OR BREAK
2474,UM IT STILL BURNS OUT,IT STILL BURNS OUT
2475,THE OTHER LIGHT BULB GETS BRIGHTER,THE OTHER LIGHT BOB GETS SPIDER
2476,TWO,CHU
2477,I'VE BEEN STUDYING MORE ABOUT MAGNETS,IVE BEEN STUDDING MARE ABOUT MAGNETS
2478,I'M GOING TO NEED HELP TALKING,IT WAS BACICALLY JUST LIKE
2479,GOOD,GOOD H
2480,IS VERY GOOD UH COULD YOU BE A LITTLE MORE PACIFIC,IS VERY GOCAN YOU BE  LITTLEMORE PECIFIC
2481,BYE BYE BYE BA BA BYE BYE BYE,BY BYA BO OF THE LY BY BY BY
2482,AND WELL I NEED HELP HI,BECAUSE IT'S BASICALLY JUST DOING SOMETHING DIFFERENT LIKE IF I CLICK ON THIS IT I'LL DO SOMETHING LIKE F I GET ON THE MAT
2483,IF YOU HAVE A MAGNET RIGHT HERE ON THIS PIECE ON THE BIG PIECE OF PAPER AND A MAGNET RIGHT HERE ON THE THIN PIECE OF PAPER AND A PENCIL RIGHT HERE IT WON'T BE STRONG ENOUGH TO PULL TOWARDS THIS WITH A PENCIL BEHIND IT,IF YOU HAVE A MAGNET RIGHT HERE ON THIS PIECE ON THE BIG PIECE OF PAPER AND A MAGNET RIGHT HERE ON THE THEN PIECE OF PAPER AND A PENCAL RIGHT HERE IT WON'T BE STRONG ENOUGH TO PULL TOWARDS THIS WITH THE PENCAL BEHIND IT
2484,THE FORCE OKAY,THE FORCE OK
2485,WELL THE NAIL HAS A MAGNETA FIELD AROUND IT SO IF YOU PUT THE MAGNET ON IT AND PUSH IT DOWN IT'S LIKE THE MAGNET WILL STICK TO THE PAPER CLIP ALWAYS,WELL THE NAIL HAS A MAGNANNO FIELED AROUND IT SO IF YOU PUT THE MAGNET ON IT AND PUSH IT DOWN ITS LIKE THE MAGNET WILL STICK TO THE PAPER CLIP ALWAYS
2486,IT'S BASICALLY JUST IT'S BASICALLY THE PAPER CLIP IS ALWAYS GONNA BE MAGNETIZED RATHER WHAT YOU DO IT'S GOING TO BE MAGNETIZED BUT IF YOU HAVE SOMETHING TOO THICK THE MAGNET WON'T STICK TO THE PAPER CLIP,IT'S SBACICALLY JUST IT'S BACICALLY THE PAPER CLIP IS ALWAYS GOING T O BE MAGNEATIZED RATHER WHAT YOU DO IT'S GOD TON BE MAGNETIZED BUT IF YOU HAVE SOMETHING TO THICK THE MAGNET WIL STICK TO THE PAPER CLIP
2487,THE NAIL ISN'T FORCING THE PAPER CLIP UP TO IT BECAUSE THE MAGNET'S OFF IT AND ALSO THE FORCE IS OFF IT SO THE MAGNET STILL HAS A FORCE AND ABSERBED IT LIKE IT UP,THE NAIL IS A FOR SEING THE PAPER CLIP UP TO IT BECAUSE THE MAGNETS OFF IT AND ALSO THE FORSTES OFF IT SO THE MAGNET STIL HAS A FORST AND OBSERVED IT LIKE SWELLD IT UP
2488,WELL MOSTLY I'VE BEEN LIKE JUST TRYING TO DISCOVER WHAT ELSE IS MAGNETS BY RUBBING A MAGNET ON SOMETHING THAT'S NOT MAGNETIZED AND IT WORKED,WELL MOSTLY I FEEL LIKE JUST TRYING TO DICOVER WHAT ELSE IS MAGNETS BYE RUBBING A MAGNET ON SOMETHING THAT'S NOT MAGNETIZED ORN IT WORKED
2489,BECAUSE OF THE FORCE IS FORCING IT TO STICK TOGETHER,BECAUSE IF THE FORCE IS FORCING IT TO STICK TOGETHER
2490,OKAY SO IT'S THE GRAVITY IT'S CALLED A FORCE AND IF IT DOESN'T STICK THAT'S FORCING IT AWAY FROM IT,OKA SO IT'S I THE GRAVITY IT'S CALLED A FORCE AND IF IT DOESN'T STICK THAT'S FORCING IT AWAY FROM IT
2491,THE NAIL WON'T PICK UP THE PAPER CLIP BECAUSE IT'S NOT MAGNETIZED YET,THE NAIL WON'T PICK UP THE PAPER CLIP BECAUSE IT'S NOT MAGNATIZED YET
2492,THE NAIL ISN'T PICKING UP THE PAPER CLIP BECAUSE THE FORCE IS ALWAYS IN THE MAGNET,THE NAIL ISN'T PICKING UP THE PAPER CLIP BECAUSE THE FORCE IS ALWAYS IN THE MAGNET
2493,NETISM BASICALLY IS VERY VERY IMPORTANT,ITIS ONLY BASTY IS VERY VERY IMPORTAT
2494,CAUSE THE NAIL IS GETTING THE MAGNETIC FORCE FROM THE MAGNET SO FOR INSTANCE IF YOU KEPT DOING IT IT WILL MAKE THE PAPER CLIP STICK,BECAUSE THE NAIL IS GAINING THE MAGNET AT FOURCE FROM THE MAGNET SO FOR INSTANCE IF YOU KEPT DOING IT IT WILL MAKE THE PAPER CLIP STICK
2495,IT'S CALLED A SHOW FLOW,CALLED A SHOFLOW
2496,EVERYTHING WILL DROP BECAUSE MOST OF THE RINGS ARE GETTING STUCK FROM THE MAGNET,EVERYTHING WE'LL DROP BECAUSE MOST OF THE RINGS ARE GETTING STUCK FROM THE MAGNET
2497,THE RIVET IS UM SURROUNDED BY ALL THE WIRES THAT ARE TYING IT UP,THE RIVER IS UHM SURROUNDED BY ALL THE WIRS THAT ARE TIEING IT UP
2498,OKAY OKAY CAN WE JUST MOVE ONTO ANOTHER THING,OKA OK CAN WE JUST MOVE ONTO ANOTHER SAM
2499,BECAUSE ALL THE ENERGY FLOWS AROUND AND AROUND AND AROUND AND AROUND THE RIVET AND GOES BACK INTO THE BATTERY AND DOES IT AGAIN,BECAUSE ALL THE ENEARGY FLS MOUNDED AROUND A AROUND AROUND THE RITAND GOES BACK TO THE BATTER AND DOES IT AGAIN
2500,CAUSE IF THE SWITCH IS CLOSED THAT MEANS THE CIRCUIT WORKS CAUSE IT'S AN ELECTROMAGNET,CAUSE IF THE SWISH IS CLOSE THAT MEANS THE CUIRCU WORKS BCAUSE IT'S AN ELECTRAL MAGNET
2501,EVERYTHING WILL FLY UP,EVERYTHING WILL FLY UP
2502,CLO HO HOSE,CLUB HER HOSE
2503,SO ALL THE ENERGY CAN COME AND STICK TOGETHER,I SO ALL THE ENERGY CAN COME AND STICK TOGETHER
2504,THAT MEANS IT'S AN OPEN CIRCUIT,TAT MEANS IS AN OPEN TIRCUET
2505,BECAUSE THE ENERGY IS IT'S BECAUSE IT'S CALLED AN ELECTROMAGNET DUM DUM,BECAUSE THE ENERGY IS IT'S BECAUSE IT'S CALLED AN ELECTRAL MAGT DUMPED UP
2506,ENERGY,ENERGY
2507,ELECTROMAGNET MAGNETS,ELECTR MAGNET  MAGNETS
2508,IT'S CALLED A RIVET,IT'S CALLED A RIVI
2509,THE WASHERS ARE GETTING STUCK BY THE THING DUH,THE WATERS ARE GETTING SHARK BY TH THING THE
2510,THE CIRCUIT IS UH IT'S A OPEN CIRCUIT NOW CAUSE THE SWITCH IS NOT ON,THE IRCAT IS ITS A OPEN CIRCET NOW BECAUSE THE SWISH IS NOT ON
2511,IT WILL JUST STICK TO EVERYTHING,IT WILL JUST STICK TO EVERYTHING
2512,IT WHEN IT'S CLOSED THAT MEANS ALL THE ENERGY FLOWS THROUGH A CLOSED CIRCUIT,IT WHEN IT'S CLOSE THAT MEANS ALL THE ENERGY FLOWES THRUGH AND MAY IS HA CLOS SECCOND
2513,THE CIRCUIT IS CLOSED SO THAT MEANS THERE'S NO OPEN SPACES,THE CIRCUT IS CLOSE SO THAT MEANS THER IS NO OPEN SPACES
2514,IT WILL JUST FIR STICK RI,IT WOULA ASTICK WERE
2515,GOOD,GOOD
2516,THE CIRCUIT IS SWITCHED ON,THE TIRCUT IS  SWITSHED ON
2517,ALL THE METAL RINGS WILL STICK,ALL THE MEDDAL RINGS WILL STICK
2518,A SHOW FLOW,A SHOWFLOR
2519,I DESCRIBED IT AS AN OPEN CIRCUIT CAUSE THE MOTOR ISN'T SPINNING,I DISCRIBE IT AS AN OPEN CIRCUT BECAUSE THE MOTER ISN'T SPININ
2520,I DID IT UH HUH,I DID EA UHHH
2521,IT WILL STOP,IT WILL STOP
2522,WELL MAGNETS CONNECT,MAGNETS CONNECT
2523,THEY'RE ALL METAL OR STEEL OR COPPER,THERE ALL MEDDAL OR STEEAL OR COPPER
2524,CAUSE WHENEVER I TAP ON SOMETHING METAL IT WILL SPIN BECAUSE LIKE IT'S METAL IT'LL WILL ALWAYS SPIN,CAUSE WHEN EVER IT TAP ON SOMETHING MEDDAL IT W'LL SPIN BECAUSE LIKE IT'S MEDDAL AND ITWILL ALWAYS SPIN
2525,IT'S A CIRCUIT,IT'S A TIRCI
2526,IT STOPS,IT STOPS
2527,INSULATORS AND CONDUCTORS,INCILLATORS AND CONDUCTORS
2528,AN OPEN CIRCUIT WAIT A BY CIRCUIT,AN OPEN CIRC WAIT A CLOSE TURC
2529,WELL THEY'RE ALL METAL SO THAT'S HOW IT WILL GO CAUSE THAT'S HOW IT WILL POWER A MOTOR,USING TH A MINATURCAT IS LYLIKE
2530,INSULATORS ARE NOT METAL BUT CONDUCTORS ARE,INCILLATORS ARE NOT MEDDALE BUT CONDUCTOURS ARE
2531,INSULATORS ARE METAL,INCULLATORS ARE MEDDA
2532,UH HELLO,THA L
2533,IT'S NOT SPINNING,IT'S NOT SPINING

2584,THEY'RE NOT ALL THE SAME THEY'RE A LITTLE DIFFERENT A LITTLE DIFFERENT WAY,THEY KNOW ALL THIS SAME THEYR A LITTLE DIFFEREN IN A LITTLE DIFFERENT WAY
2585,THIS ONE'S LONGER THAT THE OTHERS AND UM YOU ONLY SHOULD CHANGE ONE VARIABLE AT A TIME,THIS ONE'S LONGER THAN THE OTHERS AND UHM YOU ONLY SHOULD CHANGE ONEVTLAT ER TIME
2586,SINCE IT'S SMALLER IT GOES FASTER,SINCE IT'S SMALLER KEEPIT GOES FAST
2587,IT'S LIKE THE OTHER ONE THE SHORTER THE STRING IS THEN THE HIGHER THE AMOUNT OF SWINGS ARE,IT'S LIKES THE OTHER ONE THE SHORT OF THE STRINGING IS THTHE HIGHR THEM MOUT OF SWINGS ARE
2588,HOW MANY TIMES THE PENDULUM SWINGS BACK AND FORTH,HOW MANY TIMES THE PENCULOM SWINGS BACK IN FORTH
2589,WE TAPED A PENCIL TO OUR DESK AND THEN WE LET IT SWING BACK AND FORTH AND SEE HOW MUCH HOW MANY TIMES IT SWING IT SWINGS BACK AND FORTH UM IN TWELVE SECONDS,WE TAKED A PENSIL TO OUR DESK AND THEN WE LET IT SWING BACK AND FORTH AND SEE HOW MUCH HOW MANY TIMES IT'S SWEN IT SWING BACK AND FORTH UHM AND TWELVE SECONDS
2590,ACTUALLY THE BIGGER IT GETS THE MORE SWINGS IT HAS,CTUALLY THE BHE BIGGER IT GETS THE MORE STHINGS IT HAS
2591,UM WE MADE A PENNY WITH SO IT WENT BACK AND FORTH LIKE A PENDULUM,UHM WE MADE U HANY WITH SO IT WENT BACK AND FORTH LIKE A PAN
2592,THEY BOTH HAVE A PENNY AT THE END,THEY BOTH HAVE A PENNY AT THE END
2593,A FEW DAYS AGO WE FLEW PAPER AIRPLANES,A FEW DAYS AGO WE FLEW PAPER AIRPLANES

2626,WELL THE MORE THE LESS PASSENGERS YOU HAVE THE LONGER THE DISTANCE WILL BE AND THE MORE PASSENGERS YOU HAVE IT WON'T GO AS FAR,WELL MOR THE LESS PASSENGERS YOU HAVE THE LONGER THE DISTANCE WILL BE AND THE MORE PASSENGERS HAVE IT WON'T GO AS FAR
2627,WE MADE FOUR PAPER BOATS AND SEE HOW MANY HOW MUCH WATER THEY CAN HOLD AND HOW MUCH PENNIES IT CAN HOLD,WE MADE FOUR PAPER BOATS AND SEE HOW MANY HOW MUCH WATERS THEY CAN HOLD AND HOW MUCH PENNYS I CAN HOLD
2628,SIZE IS COM UH MATTER WHAT HOW MUCH WATER IT CAN HOLD THE SIZE IS YOU KNOW KIND A DETERMINE WHAT HOW MUCH WATER IT CAN HOLD,ICES   MATTER WHAT HOW MUCH WATER IT CAN HOLD A SIZES YOU KNOW KIND OF DETURM IN WHAT HOW MUCH WATER IT CAN HOLD
2629,TO HOLD PENNIES AND SEE HOW MUCH WATER IT COULD HOLD,TO HOLD PENNIES AND SEE HOW MUCH WATER I CALD HOLD
2630,UM LET'S SEE IF YOU DROP THE PENNIES IN YOU CAN HAVE LESS YOU'LL PROBABLY HAVE LESS AND IF YOU STACK EM ON ONE SIDE YOU CAN HAVE MORE BUT IF YOU STACK EM ON THE EDGE IT'LL TIP OVER AND YOU COULD HAVE LESS,UHM LET'S SEE IF YOU DROPP THE PENNIS AND YOU CAN HAVE LESS YOU'L PROABLY HAVE LESS HAND IF YOU STACK THIM ON ONE SIDE YOU CAN HAVE MORE BUT IF YOU STACK THIM ON THE EDGE I'LL TIP OVER AND YOU CAN HAVE LESS
2631,WELL WE PUT,WELL WE PUT
2632,IF YOU MADE THEM ALL THE SAME YOU WOULDN'T KNOW IF YOU MADE EM A SMALLER OR BIGGER SIZE THAT THEY COULD HOLD MORE OR LESS,IF YOU MADE THEM ALL THE SAME YOU WOULDN'T KNOW IF YOU MADE HIM A SMALLER ORA BIGGER SIZE THAT THEY COULD HOLD MORE OR LESS
2633,CAPACITY IS UH HOW MUCH WATER IT CAN HOLD AND IF,ASITY IS THAT HOW MUCH WATER CAN HOLD AND IF
2634,IF YOU PUT EM ALL OVER THE PLACE THEN IT WON'T STAY UP THAT HARD FAR AND IT'LL JUST SINK BUT IF YOU PUT THEM LIKE IN THE MIDDLE AND STACK EM YOU CAN FIT MORE PENNIES,IF YOU PUT THEM ALL OVER THE PLACE THEN IT WIL'T STAY UP THAT HART FA AND I'LL JUST SINK BUT IF YOU PUT THEM IT LIKE IN THE MIDDLE AND STACK THEM YOU CAN FIT MORE PENNIES
2635,IF YOU PUT IT ON THE SIDE IT'LL SINK AND IF YOU PUT IT IN THE MIDDLE YOU CAN HOLD MORE PENNIES,IF YOU PUT IT ON THE SIDE IT'LL SINK AND IF YOU PUT IT IN THE MIDDLE YOU CAN HOLD MORE PENNIES
2636,PAPER CUPS,PAPER CUTS
2637,IF THEY'RE SMALLER THEY WON'T HOLD AS MUCH AND IF THEY'RE BIGGER THEY'LL HOLD MORE,IF THEY'RE SMALLER THEY WON'T HOLD AS MUCH AND IF THEY'R BIGGER THEY'L HOLD MORE
2638,WE PUT THE WA,WE PUT THE
2639,THE SMALLER ONES DON'T HOLD AS MUCH WATER AND PENNIES BUT THE TALLER ONES AND THE BIGGER ONES HOLD MORE,THE SMALLER ONE DON'T HOLD AS MUCH WATER IND PENNIS BUT THE TALLER ONES AND THE BIGGER ONES HOLD MORE
2640,WE'RE GONNA S WE S SEE HOW MANY CAPACITY IT CAN HOLD AND HOW MANY PENNIES THEY COULD HOLD,ER GAN TOS WE SSEE HOW MUCH COPASSITY THEY CAN HOLD IN TE HOW MANY PENNIES THEY COULD HOLD
2641,GOOD,GET
2642,BETTER AND HOLD MORE,BETTER N HOLD MORE
2643,YOU'RE WELCOME,YOU'RE WELCOME
2644,IF THE WATER'S TOO ROUGH THE BOAT COULD TIP OVER BUT IF IT'S CALM IT'LL BE EASIER TO PUT THE PENNIES AND IT'LL STAY UP,IF THE WATER'S TOO RUFFH THE BOAT CAN TIP OVER BUT IF IT'S CALM WI'LL BE EASIER TBUT THE PENNIES AN IT I'LL STAY UP
2645,THEN WE UM WE WOULD KNOW HOW MUCH WATER IT WOULD HOLD,IN THE BOT AN SEE HOW MUCH IT COULD HOLD AND UHM IF WHEN IT ONCES O GO O ENT OVER OR IT SONG THTHEN
2646,THE S THE SMALLER ONES WELL THE SMALLER ONE WON'T HOLD AS MUCH AND THE BIGGERS ONE WILL,THE THE SMALLER ONES WILL THE SMALLER ONE WON'T HOLD AS MUCH IN THE BIGGER AS ONE WILL
2647,HOW WIDE AND HOW TALL THE BOAT IS,HOW WHY DIDN'T HOW TALL ABOUT US
2648,IF YOU PUT EM ALL ON ONE SIDE IT'LL SINK BUT IF YOU PUT IT IN THE MIDDLE THEY'LL STAY EVEN AND YOU CAN HOLD MORE PENNIES,IF YOU PUT HIM ALL ON ONE SIDE I'LL SINK BUT IF YOU PUT IT IN THE MIDDLE THE'LL STAY EVEN AND YOU CAN HOLD MORE PENIES
2649,THE UM THE CAP,THET UHM THEY C
2650,THANK YOU,THANK YOU
2651,F YOU DROP THEM IN IT MIGHT NOT HOLD AS MUCH BUT IF YOU SET EM IN AND YOU KEEP THEM EVEN IT'LL HOLD MORE,O DROP THE MIN IT MIGHT NOT HOLD AS MUCH BUT IF YOU SETTLMAN AND YOU KEEP THEM EV EN 'LL HOLD MORE
2652,WE MADE FOUR DIFFERENT SIZES TO SEE UM WHICH ONE WOULD,WE MADE FOUR DIFFERENT SIZES TO SEE U WHICH ONE WOLD
2653,IF YOU LIKE PUT THEM ON ONE SIDE IT WOULD SINK OVER IF YOU BALANCE EM IT MIGHT HA BE ABLE TO HOLD MORE,IF YOU LIKE PUT THEM ON ONE SIDE IT WOULD SINK OVER IF YOU BOWUNCE THEME IT MIGHT HA BE ABLE TO HOLD MORE
2654,THEY'RE ABOUT WHEN WE'RE TRYING TO SEE UM W HOW MANY PENNIES CAN FIT INTO IT WITHOUT IT SINKING AND UM,AND HOW MUCH WATER IT CAN GO OVER CA IT CAN FIT BEFORE IT GOES OVER
2655,IF YOU CHANGE TOO MANY,A F EW CHANGE TOO MAN
2656,WE UM WE MADE FOUR BOATS OUT OF PAPER CUPS AND WE HAD TO MAKE IT BETWEEN ONE CENTIMETER AND FOUR CENTIMETERS,WE UHM WE MADE FOUR BOATS AT OF PAPER CUPS AND WE HAD TO MAKE IT BETWEEN ONE SENTAMETOR AND FOUR SENAMETORS
2657,PAPER CUPS,PAPER CUPS
2658,IF YOU DON'T USE ACCURATE MEASUREMENTS THEN IT COULD UM LET'S SAY YOU DO ONE THAT'S EIGHT CENTI,IF YOU DON'T USE ACURANT MEASURMENTS THEN IT COULD UHM LET'S SAY YOU DO ONE THAT'S EAT SENNIM
2659,UM THERE WE DESIGNED THEM TO HOLD PENNIES AND TO HOLD A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF WATER AND TO SEE HOW UM MUCH WATER THEY COULD HOLD,UHM THERE WE DESIGNED THEM TO HOLD PENNIES AND TO HOLD A CERTINIMOUNT OF WATER NTO SEE HOW UHM MUCH WATER THEY CANT HOLD
2660,OKAY I'M NOT SURE ON THIS ONE,OK I'M NOT SURE OM THIS ONE
2661,IF THE WATER IS LIKE HA IT'S REALLY TALL WAVES IT'LL KNOCK EM OVER BUT IF IT'S CALM AND KIND OF FLAT AND JUST SITTING THERE THEN IT'LL BE EASIER TO STACK THEM,IF THE WATER IS A HUT S REALLY TALL WAVES IT WI'LL NOT COME OVER BUT IF IT'S CALM AN KIND OF FLAT AND JUST SITTING THERE THEN IT'L BE EASIER TO STACK THEM
2662,IF YOU ONLY CHANGE IF YOU CHANGE ONE VARIABLE AT A TIME IT WILL BE EASIER TO SEE IF YOU'RE DOING IT RIGHT OR WRONG,IF YOU ONLY CHANGE IF YOU CHANGE ONE VAIRIBLEAA TIME I'LL BE EASIER TO SEE IF YOU'RE DOING IT RIGHT WRONG
2663,THAT IF YOU STACK EM IT WILL STAY EVENLY AND THAT IT COULD HOLD MORE AND IF YOU JUST KIND OF PUT THEM ALL OVER THE PLACE IT DOESN'T REALLY WORK THAT WELL WITHOUT SINKING,THAT IF YOU STOCK THEM I'LL STAY EVENLY AND THEN IT COULD HOLD MORE AND IF YOU JUST KIND OF PUT THEM ALL OVER THE PLACE IT DOESN'T REALLY WORK THAT WILLE WITHOUT SINKING
2664,YOU'RE ONLY STACKING ON ONE SIDE AND IF YOU STACK EM ON ONE SIDE IT'S GONNA SINK IF YOU STACK EM IN THE MIDDLE LIKE THE ONE ON THE LEFT IT'LL STAY UP LONGER,YOU'E ONLY STOCKING ON ONE SIDE AND IF YOU SACK HIM ON ONE SIDE IT'S GONG TO SINK IF YOU STUCK HIM IN THE MIDDLE LIKE THE ONE ON THE LEFT IT'LL STAY UP LONGER
2665,IF LET'S SEE UM WE'RE,IF OULD SEE H ROIC
2666,I CAN'T I'M NOT SURE,I CAN'T I'M NOT SURE
2667,TO SEE WHICH ONE WOULD WORK BETTER IF THE SMALLER ONE OR THE MEDIUM SIZED ONE OR THE BIGGER ONE AND SO WE COULD JUST CHOOSE DIFFERENT KINDS AND SEE WHAT THE RESULTS ARE FOR DIFFERENT ONES,TO SEE WHICH ONE WOULD WORK BETTER IF THE SMALLER ONE OR THE MEDIUM SIZE ONE OF THE BIGGER ONE AND SO WE COULD JUST CHOS DIFFERENT KINDS AND SEE WHAT THE RESULTS ARE FOR DIFFERENT ONES
2668,THAT THE SMALLER ONE MIGHT HOLD LESS AMOUNT OF PENNIES AND THEN THE MEDIUM WILL HOLD A LITTLE MORE AND A LITTLE MORE AND A LITTLE MORE,THAT THE SMALLER ONE MIGHT HOLD LESS TO MOUNT OF PENNIES AND THEN THE MEDIUM  HOLD A LITTLE MORE AND A LITTLE MORE AND A LITTLE MORE
2669,IF YOU ONLY CHANGE ONE THING AT A TIME IT MIGHT BE EASIER TO SEE IF THAT THING MADE IT WORSE OR BETTER,IF YOU ONLY CHANGE ONE THING AT A TIME IT MIGHT BE EASIER TO SEE IF THAT THING MADE IT WORS OR BETTER
2670,IF YOU SET THEM DOWN IT MIGHT BE EASIER TO PUT MORE IN IF YOU KIND A JUST DROP EM IN IT MIGHT YOU KNOW MAKE IT SINK,IF YOU SET THEM DOWN IT MIGHT BE EASIER TO PUT MOREIEN IF YOU KIND OF JUST DROP MIN IT MIGHT YOU KNOW MAKE IT SINK
2671,UM LET'S SEE IF W,H UD SEE IF
2672,AT ONE TIME YOU COULD,THAT ONE TIME YOU COULD
2673,IF THEY'RE SMALLER THEN IT'LL BE HARDER TO PUT MORE PENNIES IN AND IF THEY'RE BIGGER IT'LL BE EASIER SINCE THEY'RE TALLER AND YOU CAN PUT MORE PENNIES IN WITHOUT IT SINKING,IF THEYERE SMALLER THAN IT'LL BE HARDER TO PUT MORE PENNIES AN AND IF THERE AR BIGGER I'LL BE EASER SINCE THEY ARE TALLER AND YOU CAN PUT MORE PENNIES THAN WITHOUT IT SINKING
2674,IF YOU PUT THEM IN THE MIDDLE THEY'LL BE ABLE TO HAVE MORE SINCE IT'S BALANCED AND IF YOU PUT THEM KINDA EVERYWHERE IT'LL SINK FASTER,IF YOU PUT THEM IN THE MIDDLE YOU'LL BE ABLE TO HAVE MORE SENCE IT'S BOLENCE THAND IF YOU PUT THEM KIND O EVERYWHERE O'LL SINK FASTER
2675,UM THE SMALLER ONES MIGHT NOT AS HOLD AS MUCH PENNIES BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT AS TALLER AND IT'LL OVERFLOW FASTER,UHM THE SMALLER ONES MIGHT NOT S HOLD AS MUCH PENNIES BECAUSE THEYR NOT AS TOLLER AND IT'LD OVERFLOW FASTER
2676,KNOW IF THEY'RE WRONG OR RIGHT,KNOW IF THEY WERE WRONG  RIGHT
2677,YOU SHOULD STOP THERE BECAUSE IF YOU PUT ANY MORE IN YOU'LL PROBABLY OVERFLOW THE BOAT,YOU SHOULD STOP THERE BECAUSE IF YOU PUT ANY MORE AN YOU' PROBLY OVERFLOW THE BOAT
2678,IF YOU WOULD LET'S SEE UM,IF YOU SAY
2679,WITH STRING AND THEN THE OTHER ONE'S SUPPOSED TO BE EIGHT TOO BUT IF YOU DO ONE THAT'S ACCIDENTALLY NINE IT'LL END UP BEING A LITTLE DIFFERENT,S LONG W STERING AND THEN THE OTHER ONE SUPOSED TO BE EIGHT TWO BUT IF YOU DO ONE THAT'S ACCIDENTALLY NINE  AND U BEING A LITTLE DIFFERENT
2680,UM IT WAS IMPORTANT TO MAKE SURE THERE'S DIFFERENT SIZES AND IF THEY WEREN'T DIFFERENT SIZES THEY WOULD JUST CARRY THE SAME AMOUNT OF WATER AND PENNIES,UHM IT WAS IMPORTANT TO MAKSURE THERE WIS DIFFERENT SIZES AND IF THEY WEREN'T DIFFERENT SIZES THEY WOULD JUST CARRY THE SAME AMOUNT OF WATER AND PENNIES
2681,WELL YOU SHOULD UM,WELL YOU SHOULD
2682,LIKE YOU COULD HAVE IF YOU ADDED TOO MANY THINGS YOU,LIKE YOU COULD HAVE IF YOU ADDED TO MANY THINGSYOU'
2683,HOW MUCH HOW TALL THE BOAT WAS AND HOW WIDE IT WAS,HOW MUCH HOW TALL THE BOAT WASN'T HOW WIDE IT WAS
2684,ONCE THE BOAT SUNK YOU TOOK ONE PENNY OUT AND THEN COUNTED HOW MANY PENNIES YOU HAVE LEFT AND SEE THAT'S HOW MANY PASSENGERS YOUR BOAT CAN HOLD,ONCE ABOUT SUNK YOU TOOK ONE PENNY AL AND THEN COUNTED HOW MANY PENNIES YOU HAVE LEFT AND SEE THAT'S HOW MANY PASSENGERS YOUR BOOAT CAN HOLD
2685,WHEN THE BOAT,WHEN THE BOAT
2686,THAT THE DIFFERENCE IF THEY'RE WIDER OR TALLER THEY'LL WILL HOLD MORE WATER AND MORE PENNIES,THAT THE DIFFERENCE IF THEIRE WHITER OR TOLLER THEYL WILL HOLD MORE WATER AND MORE PENNIES
2687,THE ONE THAT'S UNDER WATER HAS TOO MANY PENNIES BECAUSE THEY'RE ALL PILED UP AND THEY'RE SPREAD OUT BUT THE ONE UM THAT'S STILL ABOVE IS EVEN AND IT'LL BE EASIER,THE ONE THAT'S UNDER WATER HAS TO MAEY PENNIES BECAUSE I'RE ALL PILED UP AND THEY SPREAD OUT BUT THE ONE UHM THAT'S STILL ABOVE IS EVEN AND I'LL BE EASIER
2688,CAUSE IF THEY WERE THE SAME THEN YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW IF YOU KNOW OTHER KINDS WOULD WORK BETTER OR WORK LESS,CAUSE IF THEY WERE THE SAME THEN YOU D'T WOULDN' KNOW IF YOU KNOW OTHER KINDS WOULD WORK BETTER  WORK LESS
2689,WELL THE SMALLER ONE MIGHT BE UM MIGHT NOT AS M,WELL THE SMALLER ONE MIGHT BE UH MIGHT NOT AS
2690,IF THE BOAT IS SMALLER IT'LL BE HARDER TO PUT THE PENNIES IN SINCE IF IT HAD MORE PRESSURE AND WEIGHT ON IT AND IT'S NOT AS TALL AND IT'LL SINK WITH MORE LESS PENNIES,IF THE BOAT  SMALLER I'LL BE HARDER TO PUT THE PENNIES INSANTE IF I HAD MORE PRESSURE AND WAIT ON IT AN S NOT AS TALL AND IT'LL SINK WITH MORE LESS PENNIES
2691,U,N
2692,THIS WEEK IN SCIENCE WE'VE BEEN WORKING ON THE CAPACITY OF BOATS WITH LITTLE PAPER CUPS AND WE'VE BEEN SEEING HOW MUCH WATER THEY CAN HOLD AND HOW MUCH PENNIES THEY CAN HOLD,THIS WEEK IN SCIENCE WE'VE BEEN WORKING ON LIK PASCITY OF BOTS WI'LL LITTLE PAPER CUPS AND WE'VE BEEN SING HOW MUCH WADOR THEY CUN HOLD AND HOW MUCH PENNIES THEY CAN HOLD
2693,CAUSE IT DEPENDS HOW YOU PUT THE PENNIES IN IF YOU KIND OF DROP EM IN THEY MIGHT BE LESS IF YOU SET EM IN IT MIGHT BE EASIER IF YOU PUT EM ON ONE SIDE IT MIGHT BE HARDER TO DO THAT AND IF YOU STACK EM EVENLY IT MIGHT HAVE MORE,CAUSE IT DEPENDS HOW YOU PUT THE PENNIYS IN IF YOU KIND A DROP THEM IN THEY MIGHT BE LESS IF YOU SETTLE MAN I MIGHT BE EASIER IF YOU PUT THIM ON ONE SIDE IT MIGHT BE HARDER TO DO THAT AND IF YOU STOCK ME EVEN LIKE IT MIGHT HAVE MORE

2729,GOOD,GET
2730,AND MAKING PLANES WITH STRAWS ON A PROPELLER AND WE TOOK THE STRING AND TIED IT TO TWO CHAIRS AND WIND UP THE PROPELLER AND SEE HOW FAR IT COULD GET,THEN MAKING PLAINS WITH DRAWS ON A PEOPELLO AND WE TOOK THE STRING AND TIHTET TO TWO CHEARS AND WIMED UP THE PROPELLAR AND SEE HOW FAR IT COULD GET
2731,WHAT MAKES A PROPELLER SO,WE MAKES UP IN S
2732,WELL YOU NEED TO THINK ABOUT HOW FAR YOU SHOULD SPREAD APART YOUR STRAWS AND WHAT KIND OF STRING YOU SHOULD USE AND HOW MANY TIMES YOU UH WIND UP THE PROPELLER,WELL YOU NEED TO THINK OF  HOW FAR YOU TOD SPREAD PART YOUR STRAWS AND WHAT KIND OF STRIMG YOU SHOULD USE AND HOW MANY TIMES YOU A WIND UP THE PREPELLER
2733,HELLO,ELLO
2734,WHAT'S IMPORTANT IS THE BODY THE PROPELLER AND WHAT THE STRING AND WHAT'S HOLDING IT UP,WHAT'S IMPORTANT IS TE BODY THE PREPELLER AND WHAT THE STRING AND WHAT'S HOLDING IT UP
2735,WELL HOW HOW BIG THE BOAT IS AND HOW TALL IT IS AFFECTS HOW MUCH PASSENGERS IT CAN HOLD,WELL HOW HOW BIG THE BOAT ISN'T HOW TALL IT IS AFFECTS HOW MUCH PASSENGERS IT CAN HOLD
2736,WE'VE BEEN MAKING PAPER BOATS AND SEEING THE CAPACITY AND HOW MUCH PASSENGERS THEY CAN HOLD AND WE'VE BEEN DOING GRAPHS,WE'VE BEEN MAKING PAPER BOATS AND SEEME THE CAPASSITY TO HOW MUCH PASSENAGERS THEY CAN HOLD ANTHE WEP BEEN DOING GRAFTS
2737,WELL IT DEPENDS OF THE SIZE OF THE BOAT HOW MUCH IT CAN HOLD AND HOW MUCH YOU WOULD BE ABLE TO ESTIMATE HOW MUCH YOU CAN IT COULD HOLD,WELL IT DEPENDS ON THE SIZE OF THE BOAT HOW MUCH IT CAN WHOLD AND HOW MUCH YOU WOULD BE ABLE TO ASKMATE HOW MUCH YOU CAN AKE IT HOLD
2738,IF YOU CHANGE TOO MANY AT ONE TIME THEN YOU WON'T KNOW IF YOU GOT IT RIGHT AT THE BEGINNING OR THAT YOU HAD TOO MANY CHANGE OR YOU HAD JUST RIGHT AMOUNT OF CHANGE,IF YOU CHANGED TO MANY AT ONE TIME THEN YOU WON'T KNOW IF YOU GOT IT RIGHT AT THE BEGINING OR THAT YOU HAD TOO MANY CHANGE YOU HAD JUST RIGHT MOUTH CHANGE
2739,WELL THE YOU CAN YOU CAN FIND THAT MAYBE ONE IT LIKE ONE BOAT CAN HOLD MORE PASSENGERS TH AND ONE CAN HOLD LESS BUT IT DEPENDS ON THE SIZE,WELL THAT YOU CAN YOU CAN FIND THAT MAYBE ONE IT LIKE ONE BOAT CAN HOLD MORE IN PASSENGER RISTIC AND ONE CAN HOLD LESS BUT IT DEPENDS ON THE SIZE
2740,THE HIGHER IT GETS THE MORE PASSENGERS IT GETS AND MORE CAPACITY IT CAN GET,HE HIGHER IT GETS THE MORE PASSEANGERS THAT GETS IN MORE CAPASSITY IT CAN GET
2741,WHAT WE DID HERE IS WE WE FOUND ONE,WHAT WE DOLD HERE IS WE WE FOUND
2742,UM IF YOU CHANGE ONE VARIABLE THEN THE OTHER IF IT WORKS BETTER OR LESS THEN YOU DON'T HAVE TO CHANGE THE OTHER VARIABLE SO YOU ONLY CH SO CHANGE ONE AT A TIME,UHM IF YOU CHANGED ONE VERIABLE THAN THE OTHER IF IT WORKS BETTER OR LESS THAN YOU DON'T HAVE TO CHANGE A OTHER VERIABLE SO YOU ONLY CHSOAULD CHANGE ONE AT A TIME
2743,WE WERE IN CHARGE OF SEEING HOW MUCH CAPACITY IT CAN HOLD AND HOW MUCH PENNIES WE CAN HOLD AND WE DID FOUR DIFFERENT SIZES OF BOATS SO WE COULD SEE WHAT THE DIFFERENCE WAS,WE WERE ENT CHARGE OF SEEYING HOW MUCH COPASSITY I CAN HOLD AND HOW MUCH PENNIES WE CAN HOLD AND WE DID FOUR DIFFERENT SIZES ABOAT SO WE COULD SEE WHAT THE DIFFERENCE WAS
2744,WELL ON THE BOTTOM OF THE GRAPH IS HOW MUCH THE NUMBER OF PASSENGER NO YEAH IS THE NUMBER OF PASSENGERS THAT IT CAN,WELL AN THE BOTTOM OF THE CRAFT IS HOW MUCH THE NUMBER OF PASSANGER NYEH ITS THE NUMBER OF PASSENGERS THAT E CAN
2745,WELL THE S SMALLER THE BOAT IS THE LESS PASSENGERS IT CAN HOLD,WELL THE SSMALLER THE BOAT IS THE LESS PASSEANGERS TIT CAN HOLD
2746,GOOD,GE
2747,KAY YEAH,HE YEAH
2748,WELL WE,WELL WE
2749,THAT AS THE CAPACITY GETS HIGHER SO DOES THE NUMBER OF PASSENGERS,THAT AS THE PASSITY GETS HIGHERE SO DOES HE  NUMBER OF PASSENGERS
2750,WELL ON THE BOTTOM IS UH HOW MUCH CAPACITY IT CAN HOLD AND THE PASSENGERS AND THEN,IS  K USUALLY THE COPASSITY AND THE PASSENGERS USUALLY STAY R IND THE SAME MELT AND THEY REALLY DON'T HAVE SOME BIG DIFFERENCE IN BETWEEN
2751,WELL WE PUT DOWN HOW MUCH CAPACITY UNTIL WE GET TO THE HIGHEST NUMBER AND HOW MUCH THE PASSENGERS UNTIL WE GOT,WELL WE PUT DOWN HOW MUCH COPASSITY UNTIL WE GET TO THE HIGHEST UMBER AND HOW MUCH THE PASSENGERS UNTIL WE GOT TO
2752,WELL THEY'RE PUTTING EM IN THE MIDDLE SO IT CAN HOLD MORE BUT IF YOU PUT EM ALL TO THE SIDE IT'LL TIP OVER UM WITH LESS AMOUNT IN PENNIES THAN IT ACTUALLY CAN HOLD,WELL TEY'RE PUTTING H IN THE MIDDLE SOR IT CAN HOLD MORE BUT A F YOU PUDD MOLDS THESIDE IT'LL TIP OVER UHM WITH LESS AMO AN PENDIES THAN IT ACTUALLY CAN HOLD
2753,THE DIFFERENT SIZE OF THE CUP DEPENDS HOW MUCH CAPACITY IT CAN HOLD AND HOW MANY PASSENGERS IT CAN HOLD,THE DIFFERENT SIZE OF THE CUP DPENS HOW MUCH COPASSIT CAN HOLD AND HOW MANY PASSENGERS CAN HOLD
2754,WE,
2755,WELL WE DID FOUR DIFFERENT SIZES SO THAT WE COULD TELL WHICH ONE COULD HOLD MORE AND WHICH ONE COULD HOLD LESS,WELL WE DID FOUR DIFFERENT SIZES SO THAT WE CANT HELP WHICH ONE COULD HOLD MORE IN WICH ONE COULD WHOLD LES
2756,ALRIGHT SO LET'S SEE,SO LET'S SEE
2757,THAT THE MORE CAPACITY IT CAN HOLD THE MORE PASSENGERS,THAT THE MORE CAPASSITY IT CAN HOLD THE MORE PASSENGERS
2758,WE DID FOUR DIFFERENT SIZES OF BOATS SO WE COULD TELL WHICH SO IF WE DID ALL FOUR THE SAME WE WOULDN'T KNOW IF DIFFERENT SIZES COULD HOLD MORE OR LESS,WE DID FOR DIFFERENT SIZE F THE BOAT SO WE COULD TELL WHICH SO IF WE DID LL FOR THE SAME WE WOULDN'T KNOW IF DIFFERENT SIZES COULD HOLD MORE ORLES
2759,YOU WELL THAT THE MORE IF YOU LOOK AT THE PATTERN THE MORE THE CAPACITY IS THE PASSENGERS ALWAYS LESS THE CAPACITY IT CAN HOLD,BUT THA
2760,IT'S HOW CAPACITY IS HOW MUCH WATER IT CAN HOLD,ITS COPASSITYS HOW MUCH WATER CAN HOLD
2761,IT SHOWS YOU WHAT WHERE THE WHERE THE THE CAPACITY AND THE PASSENGERS MEET UP ON THE GRAPH,IT SHOWES YOU WHAT WHERE THE WHERE THE THE CAPASSITY AND THE PASSENGERS MEAT UP IN THE GRAFT
2762,UH UM THEY'RE AND UH UM X AND THE Y ARE MATCHED UP SO THEY'RE PRETTY MUCH THE SAME,UH UHM THEIR BOS LISING LISTINGS AND UH UHM EGS AND THE WR ARE MATCHED UP SO THEY'RE PRETTY MUCH THE SAME
2763,WELL THE MORE YOU ADD THE PASSENGERS THE DISTANCE WILL IT IT WON'T GO AS FAR,WELL THE MORE ADD THE PASSENGERS THE DISTANCE WILL AND IT WON'T GO AS FAR
2764,SO YOU CAN UM,SO YOU CAN HM
2765,HELLO OH MY,HELLO
2766,OKAY BYE,OK BY
2767,WELL WE UM LISTED THE NUMBERS OF PASSENGERS AND THE DISTANCE AND WE REALIZED THAT THE MORE PASSENGERS YOU HAVE THE UM IT DOESN'T GO AS FAR,WELL WE UM LISTED THE NUMBERS OF PASSENGERS IN THE DISTANCE AND WE REALIZED THAT THE MORE PASSENGERS O HAVE THEUHM IT DOESN'T GO AS FAR

3569,PLANTS NEED WATER TO SURVIVE BECAUSE THEY NEED IT FOR THE PROCESS OF PHOTOSYNTHESIS,BAEN NEED WATER TO SURVIVE BECAUSE THEY MEAN IT FOR THE PPROSES OF THO TO SIN THE SES
3570,NO BECAUSE PLANTS IN THE WILD WHERE THEY CAN'T GET FERTILIZER SURVIVE JUST PRETTY WELL ON THEIR OWN,AS KNO BECAUSE PLANTS IN THE WILD WHERE THEY CAN'T GET FIRA LIVES ORSURVIVED JUST PRETTY WELL ONF THEIR OWN

3585,THE SAND FALLS TO THE BOTTOM,THE SAND FALLS TO THE BOTTOM
3586,IT DISSOLVES,IT DESOLVES
3587,YOU WERE SEPARATING A MIXTURE BY PUTTING THE SMALL WATER PARTICLES THROUGH THE THINGY SO THAT WAY THE MARBLES WOULD SEPARATE FROM THE WATER,YOU WERE SEPPORATING A MIXTURE BY PUTTING THE SMALL WATER PARTICLES THROUGH THE THING SO THAT WAY THE MARBLES WOULD SEPPERATE FROM THE WATER
3588,FIRST YOU WOULD HAVE TO PUT IT TOGETHER,FIRST DO WOULD HAVE TO PUT ITOGETHER
3589,THE GRAPE AND THE WATER MIXED TOGETHER AND THE GRAPE DISSOLVED AND IT COLORED THE WATER,THE GRAPE AND TE UHM WATER MIX TOGETHER AND THE GRAPE DESOLVED AND 'T COLOR THE WATER

4049,THAT PICTURE IS OF A LITTLE IS OF A CUBE THAT IS ONE GRAM,THAT PICTURE IS OF A LITTLE IS OF A CUTE THAT IS ON GRAM
4050,I FORGET AND I DON'T KNOW,I FORGET AND I DON'T KNOW
4051,THE THEY'RE THE THEY PUT THE UM METAL CHIP IN ONE SIDE OF THE UM SCALE AND THEN THEY'RE PUTTING GRAMS IN TO SEE HOW MUCH IT WEIGHS,THEY THERE THE THEY PUT THE UH MIDDLE CHIP IN ONE SIDE OF THE UHMSCALE AND THEN THEY 'RE PUTTING GRAMSIN TO SEE HOW MUCH IT WAVESD
4052,BECAUSE THEN YOU'LL GET A MUCH MORE ACCURATE ANSWER THAN WITH YOUR HANDS,BECAUSE THEN YOU'LL GET A MUCH MORE ACCURAT ANSWER THAN WITH YOUR HANDS
4053,YOU COULD DO IT BY IF YOU IF YOU WERE JUST ESTIMATING YOU COULD LIKE I WHAT I WROTE IS I THOUGHT THE HEAVIEST WAS THE UM METAL AND THEN THE PLASTIC AND THEN THE WOOD,YOU COULD DO IT BY IF YO IF YOU WERE JUST ESTIMATINGE YOU COULD LIKE HI WHAT I ROTE IS I THOUGHT THE HEAVIEST WAS THE UHM MEDDLE AND THEN THE PLASTIC AND THEN THE WOOD
4054,IT'S THAT UM THE MATERIALS WEIGH MORE AND THAT WHEN SOME MATERIALS WEIGH MORE THAN OTHER MATERIALS,IT'S THAT UHM THE MATERALES WAIGHT MORE AND S THAT WENT SOME MAERIALES WAY MORE THAN OTHER MATERIALS
4055,UM YOU ARE USING A SCALE TO MEASURE TO MEASURE THE WEIGHT OF THE PLASTIC DISK,UHM YOU ARE USING A SCIL TO MEASURE TO MEASURE THE WEIGHT OF THE PLASTIC DESK
4056,THE UM,THE UHM
4057,YOU WOULD MEASURE THE WEIGHTS OF THINGS,YU WOULD MEASURE THE WAIGTS OF THINGS
4058,I DON'T KNOW,Y DON'T KNOW
4059,YOU WOULD NEED TO,YOU AND ME
4060,I FOR I DON'T KNOW,I FR I DON'T KNOW

4065,IT WAS EIGHT GRAMS THE LITTLE THE METAL DISK WAS EIGHT GRAMS,IT WAS ATE GRAM THE LITTLE THE MIDDLE DESK WAS AE GRAMS
4066,I DO NOT KNOW,I DO NOT KNOW
4067,UM GRAMS ARE UM WHAT LIKE THE METRIC SY GRAMS ARE THE METRIC SYSTEM ARE IN THE METRIC SYSTEM,MGRAS ARE H WHA LIKE THE MEATIC GRAS ARE THE METIC SISTOM ARIN THE METIC CISTOM
4068,THEN WE USED GRAMS TO ACTU TO FIGURE OUT THE REAL ANSWER,FDDENLY USED GRAMS TO ACTA TO FIGURE AT THE REAL ANSWER
4069,THE WEIGHT AND THE MASS IS THAT IT IS EIGHT GRAMS,THE WITE AND THE MASS IS THAT IT IS EIGHT GREAMS
4070,IT'S NOT A GOOD TECHNIQUE BECAUSE UM MISS OUR TEACHER GAVE US TWO DIFFERENT KINDS OF PAPER CLIPS SO WE ALL WE GOT DIFFERENT ANSWERS,ND A GOOD TECKNICK BECAUSE UM NAS OUR TEACHER GAVE US TWO DIFFERENT KINDS OF PAPER CLIPS SO WE ALL WE GOT DIFFERENT ANSWERS
4071,PAPER CLIPS,PAPER CLIPS
4072,I THINK IT'S THE MATERIAL THAT MAKES THEM DIFFERENT AMOUNTS,I THINK IT'S THE MATERAL THAT MAKES SOME DIFFERENT MOUNTAIS
4073,YOU UH I DON'T KNOW I THINK,YOU I DON'T KNOW I THINK
4074,IT MEANS THAT IT IS EIGHT GRAMS,IT MEANS THAT  IS AE GRANS
4075,I DISCOVERED THAT OUR PAPER CLIPS WEIGHED ONE GRAM,I DISCOVERED THAT OUR PAPER CLIPS WAIVED ONE GRAM
4076,I FORGET,I FORGET
4077,ON C THE TEMPERATURE IS TWENTY DEGREES,N SEE THE TEMPERATURE IS TWENTY DEGREES
4078,IT WORKS BETTER BECAUSE THEN YOU GET THE ACCURATE THE CORRECT ANSWER AND YEAH,IT WORKS BETTER BECAUSE THEN YOU GET THE ACCURTE TH CORRECT ANSWERE AND YE
4079,YOU USE A THERMOMETER TO MEASURE THE TEMPERATURE OF SOMETHING,YOU USE THER MOMETOR TOMEASURE THE TEMPERATURE OF SOMETHING
4080,I DO NOT KNOW,I DO NOT KNOW
4081,IT MEASURES,SOMETHING

4085,YESTERDAY WE USED OUR FINGERS TO SEE UM IF CUP A CUP B OR CUP C'S W WATER WAS WARMER,YESTERDAY WE USED OUR FINGERS TO SEE UHM IF CUP A CUP THE EAR CUP S WATER WAS WARMER
4086,SO THAT EVERYBODY CAN KNOW LIKE HAVE A STANDARD THING FOR LIKE ROOM TEMPERATURE AND LIKE WHEN YOU DON'T GO OUTSIDE AND STUFF LIKE THAT,SO THAT EVERYBODY CAN KNOW LEK HAVE A STANDER THING FOR THIKE ROOME TEMPEATURE LEG WHEN YOU DON'T GO OT SIDE AND STUFF LIKE THAT
4087,WE ESTIMATED WITH OUR FINGER,WE ESTIMATED WITH OUR FINGER
4088,YOU CAN SENSE THE DIFFERENT TEMPERATURES OF THE WATER,YOU CAN SUENC THE DIFFERENT TEMPERATURES OF THE WATER
4089,UM I DO NOT KNOW,UHM I DO NOT KNOW

4091,I DO NOT KNOW THAT,I DO NOT KNOW THAT
4092,IT TELLS YOU THAT IT'S MUCH MUCH COLDER,IT TELLS YOU THAT IT'S MUCH MUCH COLDER
4093,WE USED A THERMOMETER TO SEE THE TEMPERATURE IN THE WATER,WE USED A THERMOMETER TO SEE THE TEMPERATURE IN THE WATER
4094,I THINK ABOUT IS IT HOT COLD OR JUST WARM,I THINK ABOUT IS IT HOT COLD OR JUST WARM
4095,SO THAT YOU CAN ALL KNOW THE EXACT TEMPERATURE OF THE WATER AND NOBODY WILL GET CONFUSED IN BETWEEN WHICH ONE IS WARMER AND WHICH ONE IS COLDER,SO THAT YOU CAN ALL KNOW THE EXACT TEMPEATURE OF THE WATER AND NOBODY WILL GET CONFUSED AN BETWEEN WHICH ONE IS WARMER IN WHICH ONE IS COLDER
4096,WE WERE SEEING HA WHICH CUP WAS WARMER AND WE FIGURED OUT THAT THE B CUP WAS THE COLDEST BUT A AND C WERE THE SAME TEMPERATURE,WE WERE SEING  HA WHICH CUP WAS WARMER AND WE FIGURED OUT THAT THE BEA CUP WAS THE COLDEST BUT A AND SE WERE THE SAME TEMPERATURE
4097,IT'S WHEN IT'S HOT WHEN IT GOES UP AND IT'S COLD WHEN IT'S GO DOW WHEN IT GOES DOWN,IT WHEN IT'S HART WHEN IT GOS UP AND IT'S COLD WHEN IT GOE DOWN WHEN IT GOES DOWN
4098,YOU U WE'RE USING CELSIUS IN THIS UNIT,YOU OU WERE USING SELSIUS IN THIS UNET
4099,UM WE WE I FOUND OUT THAT THE IT WENT IN BETWEEN FIFTY AND TEN WHICH IS THIRTY AND YEAH,UHM WE EV I FOUND OUT THAT THE I ONE END BETWEEN FIFTY AND TEN WHICH IS THIRTY AND YE
4100,WE'RE MIXING THE ICE AND THE CO AND THE HOT WATER TOGETHER AND WE'RE GONNA GET A NEW TEMPERATURE OF WATER,WERE MIXING THE ICE AND THE COL IN THE HOT WATER TOGETHER AND WERE GOING GET A NEW TPATURE OF WATER
4101,WE PUT A THERMOMETER IN,WE PUT US THAMAMETER IN
4102,YOU USE GRAMS,OU USE GRAMS
4103,I FOUND OUT THAT THE DRY SPONGE WAS THREE GRAMS AND THAT BUT THAT IT WAS THREE GRAMS,I FOUND OUT THAT THE DRY SPUNDS WAS THREE GRAMS AND AT A BAD IT WAS THRE GR
4104,I FORGET AND I DON'T KNOW,I FORGET AND I DON'T KNOW
4105,A SOAKED SPONGE UM I DON'T KNOW,U SILK SPUND UHMI DON'T KNOW
4106,I KNOW THAT IF YOU UM PUT A DRY SPONGE IN WATER THAT IT WILL LIKE Z ABSORB AND GET MUCH BIGGER,I KNOW THAT IF YOU UHM PUT I A DRY SPUNGE IN WATER THAT IT WILL ABABSORB AND GET MUCH BIGGER
4107,UM THE S I OBSERVED THAT THE SPONGE THE DRY SPONGE SOAKED UP UM THIRTEEN GRAMS OF WATER,UHM THIS I OBSERVED THAT THE SPUN THE DRYE SPUNGHE SOAKED UP UHM DIRTEN GRAMS OF WATER
4108,UM I DON'T REALLY KNOW ANYMORE,UHM I DON'T REALLY KNOW ANYMORE
4109,THE SPONGE IN THE MIDDLE IS WET AND IT DOESN'T HAVE AS MUCH WATER IN IT AS THE SOAKED SPONGE,THE SPUNGE IN THE MIDDLE IS WET AND IT DOESN'T HAVE AS MUCH WATER IN IT AS THE SAT SPUNCCH
4110,I NOTICED THAT THE DRY SPONGE EQUALS THREE GRAMS,I KNOW JUST THAT THE DRY SPEND EQUAS THREE GRAMS
4111,YOU UM WHEN YOU DON'T YOU WOULD COUNT YOU COUNT THE GRAMS AND THE CUP WITHOUT THE SPONGE IN IT,YOU UHM WHEN YOU DON'T YOU WOULD COUN YOU COUNT THE GRAMS AND THE CUP WITHOUT THE SPENGNIT
4112,I NOTICED THAT UM THAT THEY WERE BALANCED AND THE WHITE THING WAS IN LINE WITH THE BLUE UM LINE,I NOTICED THAT UHM THAT THEY WERE BALENCED AND THE WHITE THING WAS IN LINE WITH THE BLUE UHVINE
4113,YOU CAN SEE HOW MUCH WATER THE SPONGE SOAKED UP BY UM DOING THE ANSWER YOU GOT MINUS THE WEIGHT OF THE DRY SPONGE,YOU CAN SEE HOW MUCH WATER THE SPUNGE SOPED UP BY UHM DOING THE ANSWER YOU GOT MINEST THE WEIGHT OF THE DRYE SPUNG
4114,IT'S GOING GOOD THANK YOU,IT'S GOING GOOD THANK YOU
4115,WE WERE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW MUCH THEY WEIGHED,WE WERE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW MUCH THEY WIHED
4116,SO THESE OBJECTS THERE'S A DRY SPONGE A WET S SPONGE AND A SOAKED SPONGE AND THE DRY SPONGE IS THE LIGHTEST THEN THE WET SPONGE THEN THE SOAKED SPONGE IS THE HEAVIEST,SO THESE OBJECTS THERE'S A DRY SPUNG O WHET S SPUNGE AND THA SAKE SPUNG AND THE DRY SPUNGE IS THE LIGHTEST THEN THE WET SPUNG THEN THE SAK SPUNGE IS THE HEAVIEST
4117,UM A WET SPONGE IS UM SOFT IS SQUISHIER AND UM IT FEELS SOFTER AND YEAH,UHM A WET SPUND IS UHM SOFT IS SQUUSSIER AND UHM IT FEELS SOFTER AND YEH
4118,WHEN YOU HAVE A BALANCE AND A SPONGE YOU CAN UM PUT THE SPONGE IN ONE SIDE AND PUT GRAM PIECES ON THE OTHER SIDE TO SEE HOW MUCH IT WEIGHS,WHEN YOU HAVE A BALANCE ON A SPUNGE YOU CAN UM PUT THE SPUNG IN ONESIDE AND PUT GRAM PIECES ON THE OTHER SIDE TO SEE HOW MUCH IT WAES
4119,I FOUND OUT THAT THE DRY SPONGE WHEN IT WHEN IT'S SOAKED ABSORBED LIKE UM LIKE TEN TIMES ITS OWN WEIGHT,I FOUND OUT THAT THE DR  SPEND WHEN IT WENT TO SOAPED ABSORBED LIKE UHMLIKE TEN TIMES ITS OWN WAIGHT
4120,IT'S WHEN IT STOPS ABSORBING WATER,IT'S WHEN IT STOPS ABSORBING WATER
4121,YOU CAN USE A BALANCE TO MEASURE THE WEIGHT AND THE MASS OF SOMETHING,YOU CAN USE THE BALENCE TO MADSOR THE WEIGHT AND THE MASS OF SOMETHING
4122,I FIGURED OUT THAT THE WET SPONGE WAS SIXTEEN GRAMS,I FIGURED OUT THAT THE WET SPUNGE WAS SIXTEEN GRAAMS
4123,I DO NOT KNOW,I DO NOT KNOW

4126,YOU WOULD NEED TO THINK ABOUT HOW LONG IS YOUR HAND OR YOUR FINGER AND THEN YOU CAN MEASURE IT,YOU WULD NEED TO THINK ABOUT HOW LONG AS YOUR HAND OR YOUR FINGER AND THEN YOU CAN MEASURE IT
4127,YOU WOULD USE CENTIMETERS,YOU WOULD USE SENDIMEATORS
4128,IT TELLS YOU THAT IT'S ONE CENTIMETER WIDE,IT TELLS YOU THAT IT'S ONCE AND A METER WIDE
4129,YOU USE MILLIMETERS WHEN SOMETHING IS SMALLER THAN A CENTIMETER,YOU'LL USE MELMETERS WHEN SOMETHING IS SMALLER THAN A SENTMETOR
4130,AND GENERALLY USUALLY UM TWO THINGS ARE LIKE THE SAME HEIGHTH,IN GENRAL USUALLY UHM TWO THINGS ARE LIKE THE SAME ITH
4131,THAT THE BIGGEST LIKE THING WITH CENTIMETERS ON IT IS A METER THEN IT GOES TO THE DECAMETER THEN A CENTIMETER THEN A ME MILLIMETER,THAT THE BIGGEST LIGE THING WITH SENIMETERS ON IT IS A MEUTER THEN I GOES TO A DEKMATER THEN A CENTIMETER THENMMEA MIDL MEATOR
4132,I SEE THAT HER NOSE AND HER EAR ARE THE SAME LENGTH,I SEE THAT HER NOSE IN HER EAIR ART THE SAME LENGTH
4133,TO CHECK YOUR ANSWER SO YOU CAN MAKE SURE YOU GOT IT RIGHT,TO CHECK YOUR ANSWWER SO YOU CAN MAKE SURE YOU GOT IT RIGHT
4134,CENTIMETERS,SENTIMETERS
4135,BECAUSE UM A METER STICK IS MORE IS LIKE YOU CAN HAVE A MORE ACCURATE ANSWER THAN IF YOU USED YOUR HAND,BECAUSE UHM A MEATOUR STICK IS  MORE IS LIKE YOU CAN HAVE A MORE ACCURITE ANSWER THAN IF YOU USED YOUR HAND
4136,UM IT'S A I FOR I DON'T KNOW,UHM IT'S A I FER I DON'T KNOW
4137,I FORGET,I FORGET

4139,BUT MY ARM SPAN AND MY HEIGHTH,THE MY EIRN SPANED AND MY HIFE
4140,I MEASURED FROM MY WRIST TO MY ELBOW,I MEASURED FROM MY RIST TOMY ELBOW
4141,I DON'T KNOW,I DON'T KNOW
4142,YOU USE A RULER OR A METER STICK OR LIKE SOMETHING LIKE THAT,YOU USE A RULLER OR A METOR STICK OR LIKE SOMETHING LIKE THAT
4143,YOU WOULD UM HAVE TO MEASURE IT SO YOU WOULD GET THE RIGHT ANSWER AND BE SURE YOU KNOW HOW LIKE TALL YOU ARE LIKE MEASURING THE HEIGHTH,YOU WOULD M HAVE TO MEASURE IT TSO YOU WOULD GET THE RID ANSWERE AND BE SURE YOU KNOW HOW LIKE ALL YOU ARE SENSE WER HIM LIKE MEASURING THE HEIGHT
4144,YOU WOU YOU COULD STILL USE A METER STICK BUT YOU WOULD USE THE CENTIMETERS ON IT,YOU WOULD YOU COULD STILL USE THA MEATOER STICK BUT YOU WOULD USE THE SENTMETER IS ON IT
4145,YOU HAVE TO BEGIN AT A CORNER AND END AT A KIND OF CORNER OTHERWISE YOU WON'T REALLY HAVE A QUITE ACCURATE MEASUREMENT,YOU HAVE TO BE GIN AT A CORNER N AND THAT A KO CORNER OTHERWISE YOU WON'T REALLY HAVE A QUITE ACCURATE MEASURMENT
4146,I FORGET I THINK,I FORGET I THINK
4147,WHEN I FIGURED OUT HOW LONG NO TALL MY EAR WAS IT WAS REALLY COOL BECAUSE IT WAS THE SAME LENGTH AS MY NOSE,WHEN I FIGURED OUT HOW LONG NOPE TALL MY EAR WAS IT WAS EARLLY COOL BECAUSE IT WAS THE SAME LENGTH AS MY NOSE

4149,THE PERSON IS MEASURING HIS PINKIE AND FINDING OUT THAT IT IS ONE CENTIMETER WIDE,THE PERSON IS MEASURING HIS PINKEY AND FINDING OUT THAT IT IS ONE CENTAIMETER WIDE
4150,YOU USE CENTIMETERS TO MEASURE WHEN SOMETHING'S NOT AS LONG AS A METER SO YOU CAN FIND THE RIGHT ANSWER,USE CENTIMETORS TO MEASURE WHEN SOMETHINGS NOT AS LONG AS A METOR SO YOU CAN FIND THE RIGHT ANSWER
4151,L IT FITS IN BECAUSE IF YOU KNOW HOW WIDE YOUR PINKIE IS THEN YOU CAN TELL LIKE OBJECTS WITH YOUR PINKIE SO YOU KNOW HOW UM WIDE OR TALL THEY ARE,O IF ITSN'T BCAUSE IF YOU KNOW HOW WIDE YOUR PINKY IS THEN YOU CAN TON'T LIKE OBJECTS WITH YOUR PINKEY SO YOU' KNOW HOW UHM WIDE OR TALL THEY ARE
4152,YOU WOULD USE EM WHEN THERE'S FOR THE MILLIMETERS YOU WOULDN'T USE IT WHEN IT THEN WHEN IT'S SMALLER THAN A CENTIMETER AND YOU WOULD USE CENTIMETERS WHEN IT'S SMALLER THAN A DECAMETER,HE WOULD USE THEM WHEN THEYRE SFUR AT THE MILLER METOR HE WOULDN'T USE IT WHEN THEN WHEN IT'S SMALLER THAN HAS ENTIMETOR AND HE WOULD RUSE SENTIMETORS WHEN IT SMALLER THAN A DECK MEATOR
4153,UM I DON'T KNOW,I DON'T KNOW
4154,UM YOU WOULD YOU MEASURED IT TWICE BECAUSE IF YOU'RE LIKE METER IF YOU HAD A ME METER MEASURING UM TAPE THEN IT WILL KIND OF GO LIKE,LIKE IT WOULD JUST GO FAC IT WOULD BE VERY RINKLY SO YOU COULDN'T REALLY GET A QUITE PERSCICE ANSWER
4155,YEAH,YAH
4156,YOU COULD USE A RULER AND THEN LIKE EVERY RULE MOST RULERS ARE THE SAME SIZE SO YOU WOULD GET A MORE ACCURATE ANSWER,WHO COULD USE A RULLER AND THEN LIKE EVERY RULE MOST RULLERS ARE THE SAME SIZE SO YOU WOULD GET A MORE ACCURATE ANSWER
4157,IT WAS ABOUT UM TO SEE HOW UM HOW LONG IT HOW WIDE IT WAS AND HOW LONG IT WAS,IT WAS ABOUT UHM TO SEE HOW UHM  HOW LONG IT HOW WHYED IT WASN'T HOW LONG IT WAS

4341,YES,S
4342,METAL IS HEAVIER THAN PLASTIC AND WOOD SO THAT MAKES IT HEAVIER,MEDDALE IS HALVPIER THAN PLASTICK IN WOOD SO THAT MAKES IT HEAVIER
4343,I PUT THE THINGS IN THE BUCKETS TO SEE HOW HEAVY THEY WERE,I PUT THE THINGS IN THE BUCKETS TO SEE HOW HEAVY THEY ARE
4344,USE A SCALE,USE A SCALE
4345,SEE THERE'S EIGHT GRAMS IN THIS CUP SO THE CUP IS THIS METAL DISC IS EQUAL TO EIGHT GRAMS THAT'S HOW YOU CAN FIGURE IT OUT,SEE THERE'S AKE GRAMS IN THIS CUP SO THE CUP IS THIS MEDTAL DISK IS EQUUAL TO ATE GRAMS THAT'S HOW YOU CAN FIGURE IT OUT
4346,IT'S IMPORTANT TO GET THE ACCURATE MEASUREMENTS UNLESS Y IF YOU WANT TO GET IF YOU WANT TO KNOW HOW E MUCH SOMETHING WEIGHS N TO GET IF YOU'RE GOING TO BUY SOMETHING,IT'S IMPORTANT TO GET THE ACCURATE MEASURMENTS UNLESS YO IF YOU WANT TO GET IF YOU WANT TO KNOW HOW YO HOW MUCH SOMETHING WAES TO G IF YOU ARE GOING TO BUIT SOMETHING
4347,I THINK THIS IS HAPPENING BECAUSE IT IS REPRESENTING THE ELECTRICITY,I THINK THIS IS HAPPENING BECAUSE IT IS REPRESENTING THE ELECTRISSITY
4348,IT IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE IF IF ONE LIGHT BULB DIES THEN THE OTHER STAYS,IT IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE IF IF ONE LIGHBUL DIES THEN THE OTHER STAYS
4349,NO IT IS NOT DIFFERENT,KNOW IT IS NOT DIFFERENT
4350,THE PATHWAYS DON'T ONLY GO THROUGH THE METAL PART OF THE LIGHT BULB BUT THEY ALSO GO THROUGH THE FUSE OF THE LIGHT BULB,THE PATHWAYS DON'T ONLY GO THROUGH THE MEDDALE PART OF THE LIGHTBOL BUT THEY ALSO GO THROUGH THE FUS OF THE LIGHBOLD
4351,A SERIES CIRCUIT IS AN ELECTRICAL CIRCUIT WITH ONLY ONE PATHWAY A PARALLEL CIRCUIT IS AN ELECTRICAL CIRCUIT WITH TWO MORE THAN ONE PATHWAY,A CERY CIRCUT IS AN ELECTRICAL CURCUT WITH ONLY ONE PATHWAY A PARELE CURCUET IS A INLECTRICAL CURCUT WITH TO MORE THAN ONE PATHWAY
4352,THAT IS REPRESENTING THE ELECTRICITY FLOWING THROUGH THE LIGHT BULBS,THAT IS REPRESENTING THE ELECTRISCITY FLOWING THROUGH THE LIGHT BUBS
4353,THEY ARE DIFFERENT FROM SERIES CIRCUITS BECAUSE THEY WOULD HAVE MORE THAN ONE PATHWAY AND SERIES CIRCUITS ONLY HAVE ONE PATHWAY,THEY ARE DIFFERENT FROM CERY CIRCUTS BECAUSE THEY WOULD HAVE MORE THAN ONE PATHWAY IN SCERIES CIRCUTS ONLY HAVE ONE PATHWAY
4354,YES I DID,YES I DID
4355,WE'VE BEEN LEARING ABOUT SERIES AND PARALLEL CIRCUITS,WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT SERIES AND PARELELS URCUTS
4356,THE ELECTRICITY IS FLOWING FROM THE BATTERY TO ONE LIGHT BULB AND THROUGH THAT LIGHT BULB IT IS IT IS FLOWING THROUGH MORE WIRES TO ANOTHER LIGHT BULB,THE ELECTRISITY IS FLOWING FROM THE BATTERY TO ONE LIBALB AND THROUGH THAT LIBOLB IT IS IT IS FLOWING THROUGH MORE WIRES TO ANOTHER LIBALD
4357,GOOD,GOOD
4358,THEY FLOW THROUGH THE R THEY FLOW THROUGH THE METAL AND THE LIGHT BULB HOLDERS,AND THEY FLEW THROUGHTHE RO THEY FLEW THROUGH THE MEDDALE ON THE LIGHE OLB HOLDERS
4359,IT IS A PARALLEL CIRCUIT BECAUSE THERE ARE TWO PATHWAYS,IT IS A PARELLO SIRCUT BECAUSE THERE ARE TWO PATHWAYS
4360,THERE ARE TWO PATHWAYS FROM THE LI FROM THE BATTERY THAT ARE GOING TO THE TWO DIFFERENT LIGHT BULBS,THERE ARE TWO PATHWAYS FROM THE LET FROM THE BATTERY THAT ARE GOING TO THE TWO DIFFERENT LYBELBS
4361,I DISCOVERED THAT THE ELECTRICITY IS FLOWING THROUGH THE METAL ON THE LIGHT BULB HOLDERS,I DISCOVERED THAT THE ELECTRISCITY IS FLOWING THROUGH THE MEDDALE ON DELIGHPAL HOLDERS
4362,BY PATHWAYS I MEAN THE ELECTRICITY FLOWING THROUGH THE WIRES,BY PATHWAYS I MEAN THE EALECTRISCITY FLOWING THROUGH THE WIRES
4363,THIS IS A SERIES CIRCUIT,THIS IS A SERIOU CIRCOT
4364,WE HAVE BEEN SEEING WHAT WILL WHAT KIND OF METAL WILL STICK TO MAGNETS,WE HAVE BEEN SEENG WHAT WILL WHAT KIND OF MEDDAL WILL STICK TO MAGNETS
4365,MAGNETS WILL JUST STICK TO ANYTHING THAT IS IRON OR STEEL,MAGNES WILL JUST STICK TO ANYTHING THAT IS IRON OR STEAL
4366,I MEAN LIKE UM THE MAGNET IS ATTRACTING THE PAPER CLIP,I MEAN LIKE UHM THE MAGNET IS ATTRACTING THE PAPER CLIP
4367,YES I DID,YES I DID
4368,WE FOUND OUT THAT IRON AND STEEL STICK TO MAGNETS,WE FOUND OUT THE IRN AND STEEL STICK TO MAGNETS
4369,THEN THE MAGNETISM WOULD NOT GO THROUGH TO THE OTHER MAGNET FROM ONE,THEN THE MAGNETISOME WOULD NOT GO THROUGH TO THE OTHER MAGNETS FROM ONE
4370,WE HAVE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT UM ELECTRICITY AND MAGNETISM,WE HAVE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT UHM ELECTRISITY AND MAGNATISOME
4371,THE THING THAT SURPRISED ME THE MOST WAS MAGNETISM TRAVELLING THROUGH THE IRON OR STEEL OBJECT SO IT COULD PICK UP MORE OF THOSE THINGS,THE THING THAT SURPRIZED ME THE MOST WAS MAGNATISOM TRAVELING THROUGH THE IRN OR STEEAL OBJECT SO IT COULD PICK UP MORE OF THOSE THINGS
4372,THE TWO MAGNETS ARE STICKING TO EACH OTHER AND IF YOU'VE ONE MAGNET AROUND THEN THE OTHER ONE WILL FOLLOW IT,THE TWO MAGNETS ARE STICKING TO EACH OTHER AND IF YOU MOVE ONE MAGNET AROUND THEN THE OTHER WILL FOLLOW IT
4373,GOOD,GOOD
4374,UM THE THE MAGNET IS PULLING THE PAPER CLIP THROUGH THE PAPER BUT IF IT'S TOO THICK IT WON'T WORK,UHM THE THE MAGNET IS PULLING THE PAPER CLIP THROUGH THE PAPER BUT IF IT'S TOO THICK IT WON'T WORK
4375,THEY ARE ATTR THEY'RE ATTRACTING AND AND IF IF YOU MOVE IT AROUND THEN THEY WILL STILL BE STICKING TOGETHER,THEY ARE ATHEYRE ATRACTING AND AND IF IF YOU MOVE IT AROUND THEN THEY WILL STILL BE STICKING TOGETHER
4376,I MEAN TURN AROUND LIKE IT'S FACING THE OPPOSITE WAY THAT IT SHOULD BE,I MEAN TURN AROUND LIKE IT'S FACING THE OPPOSITE WAY TS ITI SHOULD BE
4377,I MEAN LIKE UM BREAK THE FORCE OF ATTRACTION,I MEAN LIKE UHM BREAK THE FORCE OF ATTRACTION
4378,WE LEARNED THAT THE THE BIGGER NUMBER OF SPACERS THE LESS WASHERS IT WOULD TAKE TO BREAK THE FORCE OF ATTRACTION,WE LEARNED THAT THE THE BIGGER NUMBER OF SPACERS THE LESS WATERS IT WOULD TAKE TO BREAK THE FOURCE OF ATTRACTION
4379,THE MAGNET IS S STUCK TO NAIL AND AND THE MAGNETISM IS TRAVELLING THROUGH THE NAIL SO THE NAIL WOULD STICK TO THE PAPER CLIP AND IT'S CALLED THE TEMPORARY MAGNET,THE MAGNET IS STUCK TO THE NAIL AND AND THE MAGNATISOME IS TRAVELING THROUGHTHE NAIL SO THE NAIL WOULD STICK TO THE PAPER CLIP AND THUTS CALLE A TEMPERARY MAGNET
4380,IT WON'T STICK TO ALUMINUM CHROME OR UM TIN,IT WON'T STICK TO ALUMINUM CROWM OR HM TEN
4381,INTESTINES ABSORB NUTRIENTS AND WATER INTO THE BLOODSTREAM AND COMPACT SOLID WASTE,TESTINAS WASOR NEW TR AND WATER INTO THE BLUD STREAM AND COMPACT SOI SOLID WASTE

4579,SEE YA,SIA
4580,YOU TOO,TO
4581,UM WE WOULD PUT THE PENNIES IN CAREFULLY AND KEEP IT BALANCED ON ALL SIDES SO THAT IT DIDN'T SINK AS QUICKLY,UHM WE WOULD PUT THE PENNIES IN CAREFULLY AND KEEP IT BOLENCED ON ALL SIDES SO THAT IT DIDN'T SINK AT'S QUICKLY
4582,THANK YOU,THANK YOU
4583,THEY'RE DESIGNED TO FLOAT AND HOLD PEOPLE,THEYR DESIGNEDTO FLUAT AND HOLD PEOPLE
4584,IT SH THEY EACH SHOW UM HOW MANY MILLILITERS OF WATER THEY EACH HOLD,ITCH THEY EACH SHOW UHM HOW MANY MILLI LEADERS OF WHATVER THEY EACH HOLD
4585,EACH ARE DIFFERENT HEIGHT AND UM THEY EACH SINK UH LOWER AND HIGHER IN TO THE WATER DEPENDING ON HOW TALL THEY ARE,EACH ARE A DIFFERENT HIGHT AND UHM THEY EACH SINK UHTHE LOWER AND HIGHER INTO THE WATER DEPENDING ON HOWCH ILL THEY ARE
4586,THEY MIGHT HAVE BEEN UM DIFFERENT CUPS AND THEY MIGHT NOT HAVE BEEN EQUALLY UM MADE AND UH CUT LEVELLY,THEY MIGHTHAE BEEN UHM DIFFERENT CUPS AND THEY MIGHT NOT HAVE BEEN EQUALLY UHM MADE AND A CUT LOVELY

4588,UM I WAS AMAZED TO SEE THAT WHEN WE PUT THE PASSENGERS IN UM UM JUST A LITTLE CUP OF YOU PUT A CIRCLE AROUND IT AND EVEN THE BALANCE THEN IT MAY IT YOU COULD GET A LOT OF PASSENGERS IN THERE,I WAS A MASE TO SEE THAT WHEN WE PUT THE PASSENGERS IN UHM UH JUST A LITTLE CUP IF YOU PUT A CIRCLE AROUND IT AND EVEN THE BALLENCE THEN IT MA IT YOU COULD GET A LOT OF PASSENGERS IN THEIRE
4589,WE MADE TWO BOATS THAT WERE THREE CENTIMETERS LONG,WE MADE TO BOATS THAT WERE THREE SENT METERS LONG
4590,BY UM DOING THEM UM CORRECTLY AND ORDERLY AND UH SLOWLY SO THAT YOU CAN GET UH ACCURATE DATA,BY UHM DOING THEM UH CORRECTLY AND ORDEARLY AND UH SLOWLY SO THAT YOU CAN GET A ACCURITE DADDA
4591,UM I HAD ANOTHER DAY IN SCIENCE AND UH WE WORKED ON BOATS AND UM WE UH HAD VARIABLES AND OTHER LIKE THINGS AND IT WAS IN LIKE A LITTLE TUB,UHM I HAD ANOTHER DAY IN SCIENCE AND WHILLE WE WORKED ON BOATS AND UHM WE UH HAD VERIABLES AND OTHER LIKE THINGS AND IT WAS ANERLLIK A LITTLE TUB
4592,WELL WHEN WE MEASURED THEM WE MADE SURE THAT THEY WERE EACH UH DIFFERENT UM HEIGHT AND YEAH,WELL WHEN WE MEASURED THEM WE MADE SURE THAT THEY WERE EACH AH DIFFERENT UHM HEIGHT AND YEAH
4593,GOOD,GOOD
4594,YOU COULD MAY BE ADD MORE PENNIES OR TAKE AWAY THE PENNY AND ADD SOMETHING UM DIFFERENT LIKE A DIFFERENT OBJECT TO IT,YOU COULD MY BE AD MORE PENNIES OR TAKE AWAY THE PENNY AND ADDS SOMETHING UHM DIFFERENT LIKE A DIFFERENT OBJECT TO IT
4595,YOU HAVE TO PICK IT UP AND THEN LET IT SWING AND WHEN IT GOES BACK AND FORTH AND LIKE,YOU HAVE TO PICK IT UP AND THEN LET IT SWING AND WHEN IT GOES BACK AND FORTH ND LIKE
4596,THAT WITH THE HIGHER SWINGS UM THE UM IN FIFTEEN SECONDS IT DID UM IT HAD MORE CYCLES,THAT WITH THE HIGHERE SWINGS UHM THE UHM IN FIFTEEN SECONDS IT DID UHMIT HAD MORE SICALS
4597,WHEN YOU PUT IT AT THE TOP IT STARTS BUT GRADUALLY IT'LL START TO UM DECREASE UM IN HOW HIGH IT GOES CAUSE THERE'S NOT ENOUGH FORCE AND THE WEIGHT IS WEIGHING IT DOWN,WHEN YOU PUT IT AT THE TOP IT STARTS BUT GRADUALLY IT'LL START TO UHM DECREACE UHM AND HOW HIGH IT GOES CAUSE THERE'SE NOT ENOUGH FORCE AND THE WAIGHT IS WEANING IT DOWN
4598,WELL WHEN IT SWINGS BACK AND FORTH THE WEIGHT WOULD CAUSE IT TO SINK LOWER AND NOT GO AS HIGH WHEN IT COMES BACK AROUND AND COMPLETES THE CYCLE,WELL WHEN IT SWINGS BACK AND FORTH THE WEAIGHT WOULD CAUSE IT TO SINK LOWER AND NOT GO AS HIGH WHEN IT COMES BACK AROUND AND COMPLEATS THE SICALES
4599,IT MEANS THAT IT'S A CERTAIN THING IN AN EXPERIMENT THAT YOU COULD CHANGE OR KEEP THE SAME AND IT'S PART OF THE EXPERIMENT,IT MEANS THAT IT'S A CERTAIN THING IN AN EXPERIMENT THAT YOU COULD CHANGE OR KEEP THE SAME AND IT'S PART OF THE EXPERIMENT
4600,WELL THERE IS MORE UM THERE IS ONE ON ONE AND THEN LIKE IT GOES IN THE NUMBER OF HOW MANY THERE ARE AND I THINK WELL WELL OF COURSE IT WILL IT WOULD CAUSE MORE WEIGHT,WELL THERE IS MOR UHM THERE'S ONE ON ONE AND THEN LIKE IT GOES IN THE NUMBER OF HOW MANY THERE ARE END I THINK TAT WELL OF COURSE IT WIT WOULD CAUSE MORE WEEAK
4601,WHEN I CLICK THE BOB GOES TO WHERE I CLICKED,WHEN I CLICK THE BOB GOES TO WHERE I CLICKED
4602,WHAT'S THE TABLE FOR,WHAT'S A TABLE BIRFO COLLAGAM
4603,THE CYCLE IS WHEN IT GOES BACK AND BACK AND THEN BACK AGAIN TO WHERE IT USED TO BE,THE SIKE OLE IS WHEN IT GOES BACK AND BACK AND THEN BACK AGAIN TO WHERE IT USED TO BE
4604,YES,S
4605,YES,YES
4606,UH AT THE END OF THE STRING THERE IS ITS WEIGHT AND IT WILL KEEP THE STRING MOVING,UH AT THE END OF THE STRING THERE S ITS WAIT AND IT WILL KEEP THE STRING MOVING
4607,WELL SINCE IT'S AT THE END OF THE STRING IT WILL CAUSE THE STRING NOT TO GO FLIMSY AND AROUND,WELL SENCE 'S AT THE END OF THE STRING IT WILL CAUSE THE STRING NOT TO GO FLIMZYING AROUND
4608,IT GOES DOWN AND UP AND THEN DOWN AND UP AGAIN TO UH THE PLACE WHERE IT WAS BUT IT'S STILL LOWER THAN,IT GOES DOWN AND UP AND THEN DOWN AND UP AGAIN TO A THE PLACE WHERE IT WAS BUT IT'S STILL LOWEER THAN
4609,I MAY PUT UM SOMETHING THAT'S NOT A PENNY AND MAY BE IT WOULD CAUSE MORE WEIGHT,I MAIGHT PUT ON SOMETHING THAT'S NOT A PINNION MAYBE IT WOULD CAUSE MORE WAIT
4610,MAY BE IF YOU UM HAD A BIGGER PENCIL TO HANG IT FROM THEN UM IT MIGHT UH AFFECT MAY BE HOW HIGH IT GOES,MAYBE IF YOU UM HAD A BIGGER PENCSIL TO HANGING IT FROM THEN UHM IT MIGHT EFFECT MAY BE HOW HIGH IT GOES
4611,WHEN I DID IT TWO TIMES UH I REALIZED THAT THE CYCLES WERE THE SAME BOTH TIMES,WHEN I DID IT TWO TIMES UH I REALIZED THAT THE SICLES WERE THE SAME BOTH TIMES
4612,YOU CAN SEE HOW MANY TIMES IT WILL S MAKE A CYCLE UM IN FIFTEEN SECONDS,YOU CAN SEE HOW MANY TIMES IT WILL S MAKE A SIK ALL IFIFTEEN SECONDS
4613,YOU CAN COLLECT IT ON A DATA FILE,YOU CAN COLLECT IT ON A DAY DO FILE
4614,THAT WOULD DEPEND ON WHAT KIND OF VARIABLES THEY WERE AND WHAT THEY WERE CHANGING,THAT WOULD DEPEND ON WHAT KIND OF VERIABLES THEY WERE AND WHAT THEY WERE CHANGING
4615,THE LONGER THE UM PENDULUM THE SHORTER AMOUNT OF STRINGS THAT UH I MEAN THE SHORTER AMOUNT OF CYCLES THAT IT HAS,THE LONGER THE UHM PENDULUM THE SHORTER AMOUNT OF STRINGS THAT UH I MEAN THE SORT OF AMOUNT OF SICLES THAT IT HAS
4616,UM WELL UM I WELL I DON'T REALLY KNOW,UM WELL   WELL I DON'T'T REALLY KNOW
4617,AT THE X AXIS UM THERE'S NOTHING,AT THE EXAXCS UHM TERE'S NOTHING

4619,THAT UM THE MORE THE CENTIMETERS THE LESS THE CYCLES SO IT GOES FROM ONE TWENTY TO FIFTEEN AND IT GOES FROM SEVEN TO TWENTY,THAT UH THE MORE THE CENTAMETERS THE LEST THE SICLE SO IT GOES FROM ONE TWENTY TO FIFTEEN AND IT GOES FROM SEVEN TO TWENTY
4620,BYE,BY
4621,YES BECAUSE UM BECAUSE THEY ONLY CHANGED ONE VARIABLE FROM THE LONGER UH STRING,YES BECAUSE UHM BECAUSE THEY ONLY CHANGED ONE VERYABLE FROM THE LONGER A STRING
4622,WELL WE UM DIDN'T CHANGE THE TIME BECAUSE WE KNEW FOR CERTAIN THAT THERE WOULD MORE UM SWINGS IF WE CHANGED THE TIME,WELL WE UHM DIDN'T CHANGE THE TIME BECAUSE WE KNEW FOR CERTAIN THAT THERE WOULD BE MORE UHM SWINGS IF WE CHANGED THE TIME
4623,I FOUND OUT THAT THE SHORTER THE STRING THE UM THE LESS UH CYCLES IT HAS,I FOUND OUT TAT THE SHORT O THE STRING THE LESS E SICALE AS IT HAS
4624,I MEAN THE MORE CYCLES THAT IT HAS,I MEAN THE MORERE OR SICLES THAT IT HAS
4625,UM IT'S A PENDULUM WITH A BOB AT THE END AND IT'S ON A HIGH POINT UM AND IT'S HANGING FROM A PENCIL,UHM IT'S A PENDULAM WITH A BOB AT THE END AND IT'S ON A HIGH POINT UHM AND IT'S HANGING FROM  A PENCIAL
4626,IT HAS CERTAIN FIXTURES AND UM IT DOESN'T CHANG IT DOESN'T CHANGE MUCH,IT HAS CERTAN FIXTURES AND UHM IT DOESN'T CHANG IT DOESN'T CHANGE MUCH
4627,UM ON THE Y AXIS,UHM ON THE WIAXES
4628,I MEAN THINGS THAT WE CHANGED IN UM DIFFERENT SERIES OF THE EXPERIMENT,I MEAN THINGS THAT WE CHANGED IN A DIFFERENT TERIES OF THE EXPERIMENT
4629,THEY ARE UM HOW MANY CYCLES AND THE LENGTH,THEY ARE M UH HOW MANY SICLES AND LENGTH
4630,PRETTY GOOD,PRETTY GOOD
4631,I FOUND THE LENGTH OF HOW UM LONG THE STRINGS WERE AND OF HOW MANY CYCLES THEY HAD,I FOUND THE LENGTH OF HELL UHM AMONG THE STRINGS WERE AND OF HOW MANY SICLES THEY HAD
4632,UH I IN SCIENCE TODAY I LEARNED THAT WHEN YOU TRIED THE RELEASE POSITION IT DOESN'T CHANGE THE LENGTH OF HOW MANY CYCLES IT DID,UL I IN SCIENCE TODAY I LEARNED THAT WHEN YOU TRY THE RELEASE POSITION IT DOESN'T CHANGE THE LENGTH OF HOW MANY SICLES IT DID
4633,WELL TODAY WE LEARNED HOW TO UM UH WE WELL WE WORKED ON PENDULUMS AGAIN AND WE UH SHOWED THEM AT DIFFERENT ANGLES AND WE CHANGED UM SOME VARIABLES,WELL TODAY WE LEARNED HOW TO HM UH WE WELL WE WORKED ON PENGERLIMS AGAIN AND WE UH SHOWD THEM AT DIFFERNT ANGLES AND WE CHANGED UM SOME VERYABLES
4634,UM SO THAT THINGS DON'T GET OUT OF CONTROL AND YOU DON'T HAVE TOO MANY UM THINGS THAT ARE NOT ALIKE,UHUHM S THAT THINGS DON'T GET OUT OF CONTROL AND YOU DON'T HAVE TOO MANY UHM THININGS THAT ARE NOTLLIKE
4635,WHEN IT WENT UM DOWN AND WENT BACK UP AGAIN IT WENT AT A SLIGHTLY LOWER UH PLACE,WHEN IT WENT UHM DOWN AND WENT BACK UP AGAIN IT WENT AT A SLIGHTELY LOWR A PLACE
4636,WE WERE TRYING TO FIND OUT HOW THE PENDULUMS WORKED AND UH WHAT MADE THEM DIFFERENT AND WHAT MADE THEM THE SAME,WE WERE TRYING TOFIND OUT HOW THE PENDULUMS WORKED AND OF WHAT MADE THEM DIFFERENT IN WHAT MADE THEM THE SAME
4637,IT DOESN'T MATTER UH HOW MUCH WEIGHT THERE IS UM IT JUST MATTERS HOW LONG THE STRING IS,IT DOESN'T MATTER UH HOW MUCH WAIT THERE IS UHM IT JUST MATTERS HOW LONG THE STRING IS
4638,IT SHOWS ON THE TOP UH HOW MANY CYCLES IT HAD UM ON THE SIDE IT SHOWS HOW LONG THE STRINGS WAS,IT SHOWES THE TOP A HOW MANY SICLES IT HAD AND UHM ON THE SIDE IT SHOWES HOW LONG THE STRINGS WAS
4639,I WOULD PUT IT UM AFTER LIKE AFTER THE NAME OF THE BOAT AND I WOULD PUT IT THERE AFTER IN UNDER THE UH SIGN THAT SAYS CAPACITY AND TELL HOW MANY MILLILITERS,I WOULD PUT IT UHM AFTER LIKE AFTEER THE NAME OF THE BOAT AND I WOULD PUT IT THERE AFTER IN UNDER THE  SIGN THAT SIGE CAPASSITY AND TELL HOW MANY MELLOW LEDERS
4640,M YOU CAN FIGURE OUT HOW MANY PENNIES CAN GO IN TO IT AND HOW MUCH WATER IT CAN HOLD,YOU CAN FIGURE OUT HOW MANY PENNIES CAN GO INTO IT AND M HOW MUCH WATER IT CAN WHOLD
4641,UM WE DECIDED UM TO KEEP THE KIND OF CUP THE IT WAS AND THE CONSTRUCTION OF THE CUP AND HOW IT WAS CUT NOT THE LENGTH BUT YEAH UM WE ALSO DECIDED HOW MUCH WATER WE HAD IN THE TUB TO KEEP THE SAME AND YEAH,UHM WE DECIDED TO KEEP UU THE CONDITION OF THE CE UHM
4642,WELL WE MADE FOUR DIFFERENT SIZES SO THAT WE COULD SEE HOW MANY PENNIES EACH COULD HOLD AND THE AMOUNT OF WATER THEY COULD EACH HOLD,WELL WE MADE FOUR DIFFERENT SIZESS SO THAT WECOULD SEE HOW MANY PENNIES EACH GOD OLD AND THE AMOUNT OF WATER THEY COULD EACH HOLD
4643,THEY STAY THE SAME AND UM UH DON'T MAKE THE EXPERIMENT TOO DIFFERENT THAN IT MIGHT HAVE U MIGHT HAVE BEEN OR USED TO BE,THEY STAY THE SAME AND UH UH DON'ON'T MAKE THE EXPERIMENT DIFFERENCE TAN IT MIGHT HAVE YOU MIGHT HAVE BEEN OR USED TO BE
4644,OH I WOULD PUT IT ON THE BOTTOM,I WOULD PUT IT ON THE BOTTOM
4645,AND ALSO SETTING UP A DATA CHART,AND ALSO SETTING UP A DEED TO TIK
4646,THE CAPACITY GOES ON THE BOTTOM AND UH THE NUMBER OF PASSENGERS GOES ON THE SIDE,THE COPASSITY GOES ON THE BOTTOM AND OF THE NUMBEROF PASSENGERS GOES ON THE SIDE
4647,WE USED THE SYRINGE TO UM UH TAKE THE WATER OUT AND UH PUT THEM IN A LITTLE CONTAINER THAT MEASURED IN MILLILITERS UH TO SEE HOW MANY MILLILITERS EACH CUP COULD HOLD,USED THIS CIRANGE TO HEM UH TAKE THE WATER OUT AND THEN PUT THEM IN A LITTLE CONTAINER THAT MEASURED MILLA LEADERS AH TO SEEE HOW MANY MILLILEATERS EACH CUP COULD HOLD
4648,UH I FORGOT WHAT A STANDARD PROCEDURE IS,UH I FORGOT WHAT A SANGERTE PRESCEAGER IS
4649,IT DOESN'T UM CAUSE THE BOAT TO SINK AND THEN POP UP AGAIN CAUSE WHEN IT DOES THAT THEN THE WATER MIGHT SPLASH IN TO IT AND CAUSE IT TO SINK FASTER,IT DOESN'T UHM CAUSE THE BOAT TO SINK AND THEN POP UP AGAIN CAUS WHEN IT DOESE THAT AT THEN THE WATER MIGHT SPLASH INTO IT AND CAUS IT TO SINK FASTER
4650,WE UH USED DIFFERENT UH HEIGHTS IN THE CUPS AND BUT WE KEPT EVERYTHING ELSE THE SAME AND WE ONLY CHANGED ONE VARIABLE WHICH MADE IT A CONTROLLED EXPERIMENT,WE  USE DIFFERENT A HIGHTS IN THE CUPS AND BUT WE KEPT EVERYTHING ELSE THE SAME AND WE ONLY CHANGED ONE VERY ABLE WHICH MADE IT A CONTROLLED EXPERIMENT
4651,UM THE VARIABLE THAT'S BEING CHANGED IS THE HEIGHT OF THE CUPS AND YEAH,UHM THE VERIBLE THAT'S BEING CHANGED IS THE HEIGHT OF THE CUPS AND YEAH
4652,WE HAD TO THINK ABOUT HOW WE WERE GOING TO PUT THEM IN AND UH WE HAD TO PREDICT HOW MANY WOULD FIT IN THERE BEFORE IT'S SUNK,E HAD TO THINK ABOUT HOW WE WERE GOING TO PUT THEM IN AND OH WE HAD TO PERDICK TO HOW MANY WWOULD FIT E THERE BEFORE IT SUNK
4653,WE WE UM USED THE UM WAIT,WE WE UHM USED THE UHMWAIT
4654,IT UM STAYS A CONTROLLED EXPERIMENT,IT AH STADY IS A CONTROLED EXPERIMENT

5395,IT'S THE SOURCE THAT GIVES US THE LIGHT BULB ENERGY,IT'S THE SOUCE THAT GIVES THE UHM MYPOL BENARG
5396,ENERGY,ENEGY
5397,BOTH OF THE WIRE THOSE ONE WIRE GOING FROM THE BOTTOM AND THOSE ONE WIRE GOING FROM THE SIDE,BOT BOTH OF THE WIE THE S ONE WIE GOING FROM THE BOTTOM AND WAS ONE WIRE GOING FROM THE SIDE
5398,HOW DO MAKE A LIGHT BULB LIGHT,HOW DO MAKE A LIGHUL BLI
5399,THE BATTERY TURNED AND NOW ITS GOING THE OPPOSITE WAY AND LIKE ITS GOING INTO DIFFERENT DIRECTION ALL IN THOUGH THE LIGHT BULB IS STILL LIGHTING,THE BATTER E TURNED AND NOW IT'S GOING THE OPPOSITE WAY AUN AND LIKE IT'S GOING IN  DDIFFERENT JIRECTION NOW IND THE THE LIPORE WAS STILL LIGHTING
5400,GOOD,GOOD
5401,THE D CELL IS GIVING THE LIGHT BULB ENERGY THROUGH THE WIRES,THE DESAY IS GIVING THE THE ALIGHPUL BUHM AND A GEA THROUGH THE WILES
5402,THE LIGHT BULB NOW LEAD UP WANT TO CHANGES TO THE SIDE,THE VIBOLD NOW LID UP WHEN I CHANGED IT TO THE SIDE
5403,IT MEANS THAT IT WILL RECIEVES BUT IT WILL RECIEVES THE ENERGY FROM THE D CELL,IT MEANS THAT IT RA SIVES THET IN IT RECEIVES THE ENERGY FROM THE DESA
5404,OKAY,OK
5405,IT MOVES THE OPPOSITE WAY,IT MOVES THE OPPOSITE WAY
5406,YUP,YUP
5407,ITS FLOWING ALL IN ONE DIRECTION TO THE LIGHT BECAUSE THE POSITIVE SIDE IS GOING THROUGH THE BATTERY INTO THE NEGATIVE SIDE,IT'S FLOWING ALL IN ONE DIRECTION TO THE LIGHT BECAUSE BECAUSE OF THE UHM PLUSS THE POSITIVE SIDE IS GOING THRUGH THE BADLY INTO THE NEGGETIVE SIZE
5408,IT'S TO THE LEFT AND LIKE CENTER TO THE LEFT AND SO IT CONNECTED TO THE METAL POLE IT WON'T THE MOTOR WON'T MOVE SO THAT MEANS THE SWITCH IS MAKING IT OFF,IT'S IT'S TO THE LEFT AND UHM LIKE SENT IT TO THE LEFT AND ITS NOT CONECTED TO THE MEDDAL PUDL IT WON'T THE MOTAL WON'T MOVE SO THAT MEANS THE SWISH IS MAKING IT OFF
5409,THE MOTOR IS MOVING,THE MODELEWS MOVING
5410,THE SOLAR PANEL WAS GIVING IT ELECTRICITY TO D CELL CAN MOVE,THE SOAP PANDALS OHM GIVING IT OR I CHUSTY SO WIT CAN MOVE
5411,ITS SUNNY ALL IN THE SOLAR PANEL IS GIVING THE ELECTRICTY TO THE MOTOR,ITS SANIO AND A SOL PANDAL IS GIVING LETRISSITY TO THE MOTALE
5412,IT DOESN'T MOVE,IT DOESN'T MOVE
5413,IT DOESN'T GIVE ELECTRICITY TO GET IT DOESN'T GIVE ELECTRICITY,IT DOESN'T GIVE IT ALECTHTY TO GIV TO IT DOESN'T GIVE IT ALECTRISTY
5414,THE MOTOR STARTS MOVING,THE MOTALE STARTS MOOVING
5415,THAT IS THAT ITS OFF I THINK IT MEANS THAT IS OFF,THAT IT'S  THAT THE DO IT'S THAT'S IT'S OFFI THINK IT MEANS THAT IT'S ALFF
5416,MAKES THE MOTOR MOVE,MAKES THE MOTALE MOVE
5417,THE MOTOR STARTS RUNNING,THE MODLE STARTS RUNNING
5418,NO I DO NOT,NO I DO NOT
5419,THEY THE SUN COME IF THE SUN IS SHINING ON THEM IT GIVES THE ELECTRICITY TO ALL THOSE THINGS,THEY UHM THE SUN COME IF  SUN IS SHINING ON IT IT GIVES A LETTERE STE TE OTHER THINGS
5420,WE HAVE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT MOTORS AND WIRES AND WHEN THEY CONNECT THE MOTOR MOVES AND WE THINK,WE'VE BEEN LARNING LEARNING ABOUT MODDLES AND WILES AND WHEN THEY CONNECT THE MOTALE MOOS AND EVERY THINK
5421,NOW THE ELECTRICITY GOES INTO THE MOTOR BECAUSE IT'S NOT TRAVELLING THROUGH THE METAL AND IT IS MAKE THE MOTOR RUN,NOO LE TRISTY GOES INTO THE MOTLE BECAUSE NOT TRAVELING THROUGH THE MEDDLE AND IT DOESN'T MAKE THE MOLE ON
5422,IT GIVES THE SOLAR PANEL ELECTRICITY TO GIVE IT TO THE MOTOR SO IT MOVES SO THE MOTOR RUNS AND MOVES,IT GIVES A SOLE PANDAS ALL AT THRUSTITY TO GIVE IT TO THE MOTLE SO IT MOVES SO THE MOTLE RUNS INT MOVES
5423,THE MOTOR IS WORKING,THE MOTER S WALKING
5424,BYE MORNIE,BIYMONEY
5425,OPEN,OPEN
5426,THE FLAG IS MOVING AND ITS IMPORTANT BECAUSE THAT MEANS THE MOTOR IS WORKING AND ITS MOVING,THE FLAG IS MOVING AND ITS IMPORTANT BECAUSE THAT MEANS THE MODALE IS WALKING AND ITS MOOTHING
5427,THE SWITCH NEEDS TO BE CLOSED,DO SWISH NEEDS TO BE CLOSED
5428,THOSE TWO WIRES CONNECTED TO THE PART EVEN NEGATIVE SIDE OF THE D CELL AND ITS MAKING THE MOTOR MOVES,THER WAS TWO WHIERES CONNECTED TO THE POITIVE AND NEGUTIVE SIDE OF THE DISA ANDMAKING THE MOTALE MOVE
5429,THAT IT TURNS TO THE SUN SHINE UNTILL THAT JUST BEING GIVES THE ELECTRICITY TO ALL THOSE THINGS,THAT IT TURNS THAT THE SUN SHINE INTO ALECTRISITY AND GIVES THEALECTRISSITY TO OTHER THINGS
5430,I WILL NO ELECTRICITY WOULD COME THROUGH IT BECAUSE AT THERE WAS NO SUN ON IT MAKE A INTERVAL ELECTRICITY,IT W NO ALEHITY WOULD COME THROUGH IT BECAUSE IT DOSE NO SON ON IT TO MAKE IT INTO ALECTRISITY
5431,ITS IN THE CLOSE POSITION,IT'S IN THE CLOSE POSITION
5432,THOSE ARE ELECTRICITY GOING INTO IT,THERE WAS A LECTRUSTITY GOING INTO IT
5433,THE TRACK GIVING THE ELECTRICITY TO MOVE,IT'S NOT GEVING IT ALECTA OLECTRISCIITY TO MOVE
5434,SO THAT ENDED THE POSITIVE SIDE OF THE D CELL THAT WHILE IS GOING THROUGH THE METAL CONNECTING TO THE OTHER SIDE OF THE WIRE IS GOING TO THE MOTOR AND THAT'S GIVING THE POWER,SO THAT IND THE POSITIVE SIDE THE DESE THAT WILE IS GOING THROUGH THE MEDDALE CONECTING TO THE OTHER SIDE OF THE WIREANAS GOING TO THE MODAL ANDTHAT'S GIVING A POWEL
5435,THE MOTOR STARTS MOVING,THE MOTAR STARTS MOVING
5436,IT SHOWING THAT THE D CELL IS GIVING THE MOTOR ELECTRICITY SO THE MOTOR MOVES,IT'S SHOWING THAT THE DEESAILL WAS GIVING THE MOTAL LECTRISCITY SO THE MOTALE MOVES
5437,THE MOTOR STARTS MOVING,THE MOTLE STARTS MOVING
5438,THE SOLAR PANEL HAS TO GET SUNSHINE,THE SHOLLE PANDEL HAS TO GET SUNSHINE
5439,MAGNET,GRANDED
5440,THE SWITCH HAS TO BE ON,THE SWISH HA TO BE  AR
5441,THE FLAG MOVES,THE BLAC MUSE
5442,WELL IF SUN IS SHARING THE CELL THEN ITS WORKING BUT WHEN IT GOES OFF THERE IS NO WORK AND THE FLAG WILL,WHEN THE SUN OF SHETTING THE SA NI AD TI POR BUT WHEN IT AS THE IT WE WARED AND THE FLY
5443,THE ELECTRICITY WILL GO THROUGH THE D CELL AND IT WILL TURN ON THE FLAG,BUT EALECTRICITY WON'T GO TOR THE DA SELL AND IT WOLN'T TURNDLE THE FLAG
5444,THE D CELLS ELECTRICITY MAKES THE FLAG MOVE,DO SA   TO CITY MAKES O FLAO
5445,THE ELECTRICITY GOES THROUGH THE WIRES AND UNTIL IT'S CELL AND THEN IT GOES INTERACT WHEN WILL CONTRACTION AND THEN IT MAKES THE FLAG MOVE,BEP CUSTITY GOES THROUGH THE WIRS AND AN T LISELAND THEN IT GOES INTO THAT LITTLE  CHOC O  THAN I MAKES THE FLA HOON
5446,IT MAKES THE FLAG MOVE,IT MAKES THE FLAG MOVE
5447,NO NAIL,I ON'T NO
5448,AND ELECTRICITY GO THROUGH THE TWO WIRES TO MAKE A FLAG MOVE BECAUSE THE FLAG IS METAL ON BOTH SIDES SO THE METAL TOUCHES THAT IT TURNS ON MAKE THROUGH ELECTRICITY,VRY AN YO N EALE I UST  HE WANTED E TI T THE WIRE TO LEH LOVE LILE I S BECAUSE THE FLAGG IS IN MEDAAN ON BOTH SIDES SO ON METAL TOUCHES IT IT TURNS DOTE AND ROTE TO THE
5449,THE CELL HAS BEHIND THE SUN AND THEN THE WIRES CONNECT ALL THE WAY TO THE CONTRACTION AND THEN MAKE REFLECTIVE SO ELECTRICITY GOES THROUGH THE FEW THING OVER AND OVER AND OVER,THE SELL HAS TO BE HNG A SUN AND THEN THE WIERS AND AO ALL THE WAY TO THE CONTRACTION AS THAT O MAKE THE FLA MOVE SO E LECKE YOUR SEF GOS V THE OLD THING OVER AND OVER AND OVER
5450,IT'S ON THE METAL WHERE THE WIRE IS SO IT DOESN'T COUNT ALL THE WAY BUT IT GOES ON LIKE SO THERE JUST IT IS ELECTRICITY PASS THERE SO THEY WAS ON TOP WHAT A PRETTY AS MUCH ELECTRICITY,IT'S ON THE MEDDLE WHERE I THE WIER IS SO IT DOESN'T GO  ALL THE WAY BUT IT GOES ON LIKE HAFWAY SO JUST  SITNG FASTER SO THAT TIT WAS ON TOP  WUD   DE A SAW A HA INTRESTI
5451,THE ELECTRICITY GOING THROUGH,N THAT YOU AR RIHTO SOIG ON O ROM
5452,BECAUSE THEY DIDN'T THEN IT WHAT IF WORK AS WELL AS A IT'S DOWN SO WHILE WE ITS DARK ANYTHING OUTSIDE WILL NOT WORK,BECAUSE IT DIDT THEN I WULDN'T WORK S WELL AS IT IS NOW SOIT'S DARK AND ITS OUTSIDE I NOT WER
5453,IT'S NOT GOING TO TILL BECAUSE THE SWITCHES OFF AND IT'S NOT CREATING A CIRCUIT TO MAKE THE FLAG MOVE,IT SAN OT A TO G THR BECAUSE THE SWITCH IS OFF AND IT'S NOT OQU ON THE CIRCUT TO MAKE A PA AME
5454,NO,REALLY
5455,IT'S NOT TOUCHING METAL SO WHERE ELECTRICITY WON'T GO TO THE FLAG AND IT WILL MAKE A CIRCUIT,IT'S NOT TOUCHING A MEDDAL SO WA ALECTRISITY WILN'T GO TO THE FLAGS AND IT WIL'T MAKE A CIRCU
5456,BECAUSE THE D CELL HAS ELECTRICITY IN IT SO WHEN THEN TWO CONNECTERS CONNECT TO THE METAL FIND ON BOTH SIDES AS THE SWITCH TOUCHES METAL THEN IT WILL START WORKING AND CREATE AND PUT IT WOULD ELECTRICITY TO THE FLAG,CAUSE THE DEE SE HAS A LECTRISITY IN IT SO IN THE TWO CONECTORS CONECT TO THE MEDTAL FLAG ON BOTH SIDES AND THE SWISH TOUCH IS MEDDAL IN TELE START WORKCREAT AND  D IYELLO JUST NIKTO THE FLAG
5457,THE D CELL IS AT A CIRCUIT,ATHE DS ISN'T A SERI I THE TTAIC CH
5458,THOSE ARE ALSO THAT ELECTRICITY SO WHEN YOU PUT TWO WIRES ON THEY AND PUT A SET TO A D CELL AND PUTTING INTO SUN THEN VIBRATING TO BE LIKE THAT ELECTRICITY GOING THROUGH THAT CELL,TS O ALSO ABOUT THELECTRISITY SO WHEN HE PUT TWO EYES  ONE AND HERTY IT TOENTY SOW AND PUT IT IN THE SUNIBRETING TT HIO ERSDIS ELLOW CHIST ONE THROUGH THAT S
5459,IT HAS TO BE ON THE METAL,IT HAS TO BE ON THE MEDDAL
5460,WE'VE HAS BEEN CREATING CIRCUIT,LEAVE N RAITING A SURCET
5461,THEN IT DOESN'T WORK,THEN IT IS I WOR
5462,THAT WHEN I TOUCH IT IT MOVES AND THEN I TOUCH IT AGAIN IT MOVES OFF THE CIRCUIT SO IT WILL PRODUCE THE ELECTRICITY BUT WON'T DOES TOUCH THE METAL AND PRODUCES ELECTRICITY,THAT WHEN I TOUCH IT IT MOVES AND THEN WHEN I TACH IT AGAIN IT MOVES OFF IF THE SIRC SO IT WILL YOUSEE ALL JUS SEY ITWHE IT DOESE TAUCH THE LITTLE IT PRETTY SAURLY
5463,BECAUSE WHEN THE WIRE FIX THE D CELL AND OTHER ELECTRICITY DOESN'T LIKE CONTRACTED LIKE THEY CONTRACTED TOO,CAUSE WE   THE WIERE ITS LS AROUND A I D  LEKE OUR CITY O  CHAREN MAKE  THECHI WORK
5464,THE FLAG MOVES,THE FLAGMOVES
5465,IT WOULDN'T WORK BECAUSE THAT'S BE SEMI AND MIKE HAS BEEN GETTING IT,A LTO GAR CUS ASKBASUNDAY AND HIGHT HASY KIDDY
5466,ELECTRICITY IS GOING THROUGH IT TO MAKE IT MOVE,ELECTRISTY IS GONG T TIN I GET A NEW ROOM
5467,THE D CELL AND THE ELECTRICITY,THE DCO A TISI
5468,THE D CELL HAS TO BE ATTRACTED TWO WIRES TO GO THROUGH THE ELECTRICITY TO GET TO THE MOVE,IT SALL HAV TO BE AX  TO GO  ARD  TO GO ITWHER  EALETRISITY TO GET TO EN
5469,THE FLAG STOPS MOVING BECAUSE IT DOES THE SUNLIGHT AND IT IS HAVE ELECTRICITY BETWEEN THE WIRES,THE FLY STOPS IN THE BAND BECAUSE IT  IT DOES T HEV A LIAND IT IS A HEAVY ITC TO SE BETWEEN ER W
5470,NO METAL IS PUT TOUCHING THOSE TWO WIRES AND LIKE THAT AND CONNECT STILL JUST READY TO GET THE,O MEDDL IS  TOUCH  RO TO THE IRE SO IT  IA THE IT WAS FELE JUST NWIN TO GET  O  GOONPIE
5471,I TALK TO YOU LATER BYE,I'LL TALK TOO LATER B
5472,YOU'RE SEPARATE NO AND THERE ITS IT'S LIKE WE BETTER SO YEAH,JOUST U PUT AN NAL IN THERE IT'S IT'S LIKE WAY BETTER SO YEH
5473,I DON'T KNOW,I DON'T KNOW
5474,ITS FLOWING THROUGH ELECTRICITY,CH IT'S FLOWING THROUGH A ALECTRISCITY
5475,ELECTRICITY IS GOING THROUGH IT OKAY,E LECS THE CITTY IS GOING THOH I OK
5476,AND FINNALY MET BEFORE,I'M FINEA WE'VE MET BEFORE
5477,WE'VE BEEN LEARNING SCIENCE YOU CAN TALKING TO ME ABOUT IT,WE'VE BEEN LEARNING SCIENCE EVER SINCEYOU BEN TALKING TO ME ABOUT IT
5478,YOUR DOWN,YOUR DONE
5479,BECAUSE THERE NOT METAL LIKE ALL THE OTHER ONCE,CAUSE THEY'RE NOT MEDDL LIKE ALL THE OTHER ONES
5480,IT WORKS BECAUSE IT'S A METAL,IT WORKS ECAUSE IT'S A MEDDALE
5481,WE SEEN EACH OTHER BEFORE,WE'VE SEEN EACH OTHER BEFORE
5482,JUST DRAW THE TAPE THE SPIRAL THAT ROCK IN STUFF ARE ALL INSULATORS BUT A OTHER STUFF IS CONDUCTORS,THI STRAW THE TAPE THE SPUNGE THE ROCK AND STUFF ARE ALL INSILATORS BUT IT AL THUGH OTHER STUFF IS CONDUCTOURS
5483,ONE THE METAL IS TOUCHING THE SWITCH SO I ALREADY KNOW THAT,USHING THIS ONE UHM THE MEDAL IS TOUTCHING THE SWISH SO W YOED INTE B
5484,THE NAIL,THE NAIL
5485,METAL IS SOMETHING IF SOMETHING'S METAL THEN AND IT STICKS TO SOMETHING ALL SIDES METAL THEN IT WOULD WORK AND IT WOULD COMPLETE CONDUCTOR,MEDDAL IS SOMETHING IF SOMETHING IS A MEDDAL THN AN IT STICKS TO SOMETHING ELSE THAT'S AMEDDALE THAN IT WOULD WORK AND IT WOULD COMPLET A CONDUCTOR
5486,BECAUSE THE SWITCH IS METAL SO THAT'S METAL SO IT'S MAKE IN A WORK,CAUSE THE SWISH IS METAL SO THAT'S METAL SO IT'S MAKIN IT WORK
5487,INSULATORS ARE SOME STUFF THAT'S NOT METAL BUT CONDUCTORS ARE THINGS ARE METAL THAT MAKES JUST SITTING,IE LEATERS ARE SOME STUFF THAT'S NOT MIDDLE BUT UHM CONDUCTORS URE THINGS THAT ARAMIDDLE THAT MAKES L JUST ITY
5488,IT'S NOT GOING BECAUSE IF THAT'S NOT METAL THEN WORK,IT'S NOT GOING CAUSE IF THAT'S NOT MEDTAL THAN IT WON'T WORK
5489,I DON'T KNOW CAN YOU REPEAT THAT PLEASE,I DON'T KNOW CAN YOU REPEAT THAT PLEAS
5490,ELECTRICITY IS GOING TO THROUGH THE NAIL,IT L TUSTIT IS GOING THOUGH WITH A NAIL
5491,ITS OPEN,ITS OPENE
5492,ALL THE OBJECTS WILL NOT MAKE ELECTRICITY GO,ALL THE OBJECTS WILL NOT MAKE ELECTS UST ITY GO
5493,YEAH I'M GOOD HOW ARE YOU I KNOW YOU WE MET BEFORE BUT NO I DON'T WANT TO MEET YOU,YEAHM GOOD HOW ARE YOU I KNOW THEVVENT BEFORE BU NO I DONT WANT TO MET YOU I
5494,BECAUSE THE SWITCHES OFF AND IT'S CREATING A CIRCUIT ELECTRICITY ALL AWAY TO THAT MOTOR,CAUSE THE SWISH IS OFF AND IT'S CRATING A CIRCET AND ELECTRISSITY ALL E WAY TO THAT LAN ORTATY MOTOR
5495,THE FLAG IS BEEN MOVING BECAUSE THE D CELL HAS TO BE,THE FLAG IS IT MOVING CAUSE THE DEEP SOL HAS TO BE HUKED UP TO THE SWISH
5496,WHEN I CLICK THE SWITCH AND IT GOES ON THE METAL IT WORKS AND GOES TO THE MOTOR CIRCUIT IT CREATE ELECTRICITY OVER THAT IT IS ON IT WON'T WORK,WHEN I CLICK THE SWISH AND IT GOES ON THE MIDDLE IT WORKS AND GOES TO THE MOTOR SO IT CANDY CRAT ALECTRISITY BUT WHEN IN IT IS ON IT WON'T WORK
5497,THE CELL IS HITTING THE MOTOR SO WHEN THE CELL HITS THE MOTOR THE WIRES IT ALWAYS TO THAT CELL AND THAT IT'S START WORKING,THE SUN IS HIDDING THE MOTOR SO WHEN THE SUN HITS THE MOTOR THE WIRES IT ALL AWAY TO THE SELL AND THEN IT JUST STARTS WORKI
5498,IT WILL STOP WORKING BECAUSE IT'S NOT CREATING ELECTRICITY,IT WILL STOP WORKING BECAUSE IT'S ALOT CREATING AN IT'S JUST A
5499,IT IS HAVING THE ELECTRICITY GOING TO THE MOTOR MAKE A FLAG MOVE,IS HAV ANG ELECTRISSITY GOING TO THE MOLOR AND MAKE ING A FLAG MOVE
5500,IT DOESN'T WORK,IT DOESN'T WORK
5501,IT WORKS,IT WORKS
5502,IT DOESN'T WORK,IT DOESN'T WORK
5503,WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT CIRCUITS,WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT CIRCUTS
5504,BECAUSE IF IT DOESN'T HAVE IF THE SUN HAS TO HIT THAT LITTLE CONTRACTION THERE THEN IT WILL WORK,CAUSE IF IT DOESN'T HIT IF THE SUN DOES IT HIT THAT LITTLE TRATCHING THERE DED IT WON'T WORK
5505,WHEN YOU CLICK ON THE CELL ITS STARTS WORKING WILL A STOPS WORKING,WHAT IT WHEN YOU CLICK ON THE SUN  IT STARTS WORKING BUT WHAT IS A CLOUDY DAY T STOP O WORK KITCH
5506,LET THE SWITCH HAS TO BE OFF,BU THE SWISH HAS TO BE OFF
5507,THE D CELL IS PUT DOES THE ELECTRICITY ALL AWAY TO THE MOTOR AND MAKING THE FLAG MOVE,THE DEEAILL IS PREDUCING ELECTRICITTY AL THE WAY TO THE MOTER AND MAKING A FLAG MO
5508,NO,THOUGH
5509,AND TILL,OU TOO
5510,THE CELL IS HITTING THE MOTOR AND THE MOTOR SET UP THE TWO WIRES ALL THE WAY TO THE CELL SO WHILE THOUGH THAT CELL DOES HITTING IT IT STARTS WORKING,THE SUN IS HIDTING THE MOTOR AND THE MOTORS LOOK UP THE TWOE WIRES ALL THE WAY TO THE SELL SO WHEN TSUN IS HITTING IT IT IT STARTS WORKING
5511,WHAT,WHAT
5512,IT DOESN'T WORK,IT DOESN'T WO
5513,THE FLAG MOVES,THE FLAG MOOVES
5514,IT DOESN'T WORK,IT DOES IT WORK
5515,ELECTRICITY,TESITY
5516,THAT PUT DOES THE ELECTRICITY,THEY' PRODUCING ELECTRIST
5517,IT'S CREATING A CIRCUIT THAT MAKES THE MOTOR RUN AND MAKES THE FLAG MOVE,IT'S CREATING AF SICKON THAT MAKE THE MOTER RUN AND MIX THE FLAG MOOVE
5518,THAT IT RUNS WHEN THE FLAG MOVES BECAUSE THE CELL IS GAIN ELECTRICITY FROM THE SUN THAT TWO WIRES ARE HITTING THE MOTOR SO WAS THE TWO WIRES MAKE ELECTRICITY TO THE MOTOR THEN THE FLAG MOVE,S THAT IT RUNS THEN THE FLAT MOVES BECAUSE THE SELL IS GETTING ALICS RISTING FROM THE SUN THE TWO WITERS ARE HITTING THE MOTER SO WHEN THE WHEN THE TWO WIRE IS MAKING ALECTRISITY TO THE MOTERTHEN THE FLAG MOVE
5519,THAT IT'S OFF THE D CELL IT'S OFF THIS THE METAL SO IT WON'T MOVE THE FLAG,THAT IT'S OFF THE DEESELL IS OFF THE STHE MEDDAL SO IT WON'T MOVE THE FLAG
5520,IT MAKES IT WORK,IT MAKES IT WORK
5521,IT WOULD BECAUSE IT'S NOT REALLY SUNNY,IT WOULDN'T WAR CAUSE IT'S NOT REALLY SUNNY
5522,OKAY,OK
5523,THE CELL HAS TO BE HITTING IT,THE SUN HAS TO BE HITTING I
5524,GOOD,GOOD
5525,THEY MAKE ELECTRICITY GO THROUGH,THEN MAKE A LECTRISTITY GOH THROUGH
5526,IT WOULDN'T WORK,IT WOULDN'T WOR
5527,NOW ITS GOING THE OPPOSITE WAY BUT ITS GOING SAME WAY BUT IF WAS TURNED AROUND THEY WOULD BE GO IN THE OPPOSITE WAY,NOW IT'S GOING THE OPPOSITE WAY BUT IT'S OT GOING TO SAME WAY BUT IF IT WAS TURNE R OND IT WOULD BE GO ING THE OPPOSITE WA
5528,ITS GOING THE DIFFERENT WAY ITS GOING LIKE THEN POSITIVE SIDE GO IN THE NEGATIVE SIDE GOING THESE WAY SO ITS GOING TO THE POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE SIDE BUT EVEN LIGHT BULB IS MUST BE ONE TO THE THAT'S I BUT ANYWAY ITS GOING THE OTHER,IT'S GOING THE DIFFERENT WAY IT'S GOING LIKE THE D POSITIVE SIDES  GO AD THE NEGOTIVE SIDE'S GOING THIS WAY SO IT'S GOING THROUGH THE POSIT TE NEGGOTIVE SI UT EVEN THOH THOGH LIE PALBIS MUST BE AN THROUGH THAT SIDE BUT ANYWAY IT'S GOING T TH OTHER
5529,LIGHT,RIGHT
5530,OKAY,OK
5531,THAN IT WOULD WORK BECAUSE IF IT WAS JUST AT THE BA ARE THE TWO BASES OF BULB AROUND LIGHTS MUST GO UP THE LIGHT BULB SO I WERE WORK EASIER,THEN IT WOULDN'T WORK BECAUSE IF IT WAS JUST AT THE BA OF THE TWO BACES OF THE BALL THEN'TWAILDN' WORK CAUSE THE WISE POSTICGAL UP THE LIGHT BOD SO ILL WILL BE ORK EASIER
5532,THE TWO WIRES ARE CONNECTED TO THE NEGATIVE AND POSITVIE SIDE AND THEN THE NEGATIVE GOES TO THE SIDE OF THE METAL OF LIGHT BULB AND THEN POSITVE SIDE GOES UP IN LIGHT BULBS ARE PRODUCES THE ELECTRICITY THROUGH THE LIGHT BULB,THE TWO WIERS ARE CONECTED TO THE NEGGOTIVE ANPOSITIVE SIDE AND THEN THE THE ANEGGOTOVE GOES TO THE SIDE OF THE MIDDLE OF THE LIGE ALL AN THEN THE POSITIVE SIDE GOES UP AND TEI O SO IT PRODUCEES THE JUST  E THROUGH THE LIGHE HALL
5533,I'M GOOD,ACURED
5534,THE ELECTRICITY,ELECTRIT
5535,TWO WIRES HAVE TO BE CONNECTED TO MAKE A COMPLETE CIRCUIT,TWO WISE HAVE TO BE CONNECTED TO A TO MAKE A COMPLIET SURC
5536,IT HAS TO TAKE A PATH WHEN YOU COLLECT IT,HOUSE TO WAKE A PATH WHEN YOU COLLECED
5537,COMPLETE CIRCUITS,COMPLET CURCUTS
5538,IT LIGHT UP LIKE IN HER ON A LAMP ELECTRICITY GOES THROUGH AND IT GOES THROUGH UP AND THEN STILL MAKE US BACK UP,IT LIKES UP LIKE IN HER ON A LAMP IT LOK JUST IT GOES THROUGH AND ITIT GOES UP AND THEN ITOIT GOES BACK O
5539,BOTH SIDE,BOTHSI
5540,IT AS HOW YOU ELECTRICITY WAS TO WIRES,IT HAS A HAVY LECTRISCITY WITH TWO WIRES
5541,THAT THERE IS LIKE THE ELECTRICITY THE LIGHT BULB,THAT THERE'S ALWAYS THE ELECTRICITY FLUNG THROUGH LIL LIGE BOA
5542,ELECTRICITY,YU LETD YOR CITTY
5543,ITS NEGATIVE IN POSITIVE SIDE CONNECTED TO LIGHT BULB,IT'S THE NEGOTIVE ANPOSITIVE SIZE CONECTID TI HE LIGHEBALL
5544,I NOTICED THAT THE FLIP THIS THAT SHOULD I NOTICED THAT IF YOU'D PUT PUT IT TO THE NOT THE NEGATIVE SIDE THEY WILL GO UP THAT WAY BUT THE PEOPLE ON THE POSITIVE SIDE THEN YOU KNOW GO THE SAME WAY THAT IT WAS IN THE BEGIN,I NOTICED THAT IF YOU FLI IT THIS THE I NOTICED THAT IF YOUD P PUT IT TO THE NOT E NEGGTIVE SIDE THEN IT WIILL GO T OPPOSITE WAY BUT IF OU PUT IT ON THE POSIT UPSIDE THE NOTE GO THE SAME WAY THAT IT WAS IN THE BEGI
5545,ITS FLOWING THROUGHT THE LIGHT BULB AND TO THE POSITIVE SIDE,ITS FLOTING THREW THEEI INTO THE POSITERS SAID
5546,ELECTRICITY,E LECTRISCITY
5547,IF THE CIRCUIT,IT'S A S
5548,DO YOU THINK ELECTRICITY,DO THING HE LIKES JUST SAID
5549,THE TWO WIRES ARE CONNECTED AND THE METAL IS TOUCHING,THAT TWO WIRES ARE CONECTED AND THE MIDDLE IS TOUCHING
5550,THEY SEE A LATER,A SEEA LATER
5551,BATTERY LIGHT BULB AND WIRE,BATTERY LIKE BUB AND WIR
5552,I DON'T KNOW,I DON'T KNOW
5553,THE NEGATIVE,THE NAGGOTE
5554,ELECTRICITY,ELECTROCITY
5555,THAT THEY CAN CONNCET TO EACH OF THEM BUT IF THERE IF THE TWO WIRES BOTH AT THE BASE OF THE SIDE OF THE LIGHT BULB IT GOING TO LIGHT UP HAS IT DOESN'T KNOW,THAT THEY CAN CONECT T EACH OF THEM BUT IF THEY WERE IF THOE TWO YRES WERE BOTH AT THE BACE OF THE SIDE OF THE LOT BULL IT WOULDN'T LIGHT UP AS IT DOES NOW
5556,THE PLY IS THAT IT HAS TO BE TOUCHING METAL WITH THE TWO WIRES AS WE TOUCHING THE LIGHT BULB THEN ORDER OF TWO,THE POINT IS THAT IT HAS TO O BE TOUCHING MEIDDALE WITH THE TWO WIRES HAS O BE TOUCHING THE LIGHT BALS IN ORDER FOR TO LET T
5557,THE REALLY THROUGH THE WIRES INTO THE LIGHT BULB BACK INTO THE ONE POSITIVE,THREUWH IT THREWH THE WIRES INTO THELIGHT FALL BACK INTO THE POSITAND
5558,YEAH,ZAH
5559,LIKE IF EVERYBODY GOT THE SAME ANSWER IT MIGHT'VE TAKEN A LONGER TIME TO TEST OUT THIS EXPERIMENT,LIKE IF EVERYBODY GOT THE SAME ANSWER IT MIGHT HAVE TAKEN THE LONGER TIME TO TEST OUT THIS EXPERIMENT
5560,WELL UM THAT'S JUST KIND OF HOW SHE TOLD US TO SET IT UP,WELL UH  THE SHIST KIND OF HOUS SHE TOLD US TO S
5561,LIKE IF I SAID IF I WAS GOING ONE TWO THREE AND I WAS DOING IT LIKE MAYBE BY MYSELF THEN UM I MAY'VE MISCOUNTED ONE AND THAT WOULD MESS UP THE WHOLE EXPERIMENT,LIKE IF I SAID IF I WAS GOING ONE TWO THREE AND I WAS DOING IT LIKE MAYBE BY MYSELF THEN HM I MAY HAVE MIS COUNTED ONE  AND THAT WOEDN I SAW THE WHOLE IERED
5562,BUT IT ARE YOU ASKING ME LIKE WHERE IT'S SET UP,BUT A ARE YOU ASING ME LIKE WHERE IT SET UP
5563,WELL IF YOU LIKE DO IT I GUESS IF YOU KIND OF TODAY UH WE'RE GONNA DO IT OUTSIDE UM,WE'LL IF YOU LIKE DO IT I GUESS IF YOU KIND OF TODAY I'M WORKING ON DO IT OUTSIDE

7384,IT CHANGED BECAUSE YOU PUT HIM YOU,IT CHANGED BECAUSE YOU B PUT HIM
7385,THE,DESU
7386,SO YOU MIX WATER ANY PUT AND NOW OPEN THE AND YOU POUR IT IN THE WATER CHANGE OUT PUT SOME MARBLE STAY,SO YOU' MIXED A MARBLE WITH WATER AND YOU PUT A NET OVER THE POLE AND YOU PORE IT IN THE WATER JRAINS OUT BUT THE MARBLE STAY
7387,IT IS DISSOLVING INTO OTHER THINGS,IT IS DEVALVING IN TO AL THER THINGS
7388,IT IS DISSOLVING,IT IS E FALVE FING
7389,THAT THE WHEN THE SALT WHEN YOU POUR WATER IN THE SALT IT DISAPPEARS AND NOT DISCLOSING MAKE SURE BUT YOU DON'T KNOW IT JUST LOOKS LIKE CLEAN WATER IN THAT IN THE WATER LOOKS LIKE GET STARTED,THAT THE WHIN THE SALT WHEN YOU PORE WATER IN THE SALT IT DISAPPEARES AND THATS CALLED A MIXTURE BUT YOU DON'T KNOW IT JUST LOOKS LIKE PLEAM WATER IN THE DIRT IN THE WATER LOOKS LIKE THAT THE DIRT DIDN'T GET STURT UP
7390,NO BECAUSE IT IS MIXED IN THERE AND WHEN YOU DRINK IT HE DOES NOT COME OUT,NO BECAUSE IT IS MIXED IN THERE AND WHEN YOU DRANK IT IT DOES NOT COME OUT
7391,IT IS THE DIFFERENT MIXTURE BECAUSE IT IS DISSOLVING AND TO A DIFFERENT THING WITH THE MOTOR,YOU KNEWS A DIFFERENT MICTURE BECAUSE IT S DA VOLVING INTO A DIFFRENT THING WITH THE GRAVIL IN WATER
7392,IT IS DISSOLVING INTO OTHER THINGS,IT DES DESOLVING INTO OTHER THINGS
7393,IT HAS SEPARATED AND THE,I HAUS SEPPERATEDAND THE

7395,I'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT MIXTURES,I'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT MIXTURES
7396,ITS NOT MIXTURE ANYMORE,IT'S NOT MIXTURED ANYMORE
7397,IT WAS MIXTURE BUT NOW YOU HAVE SEPARATED EVERYTHING THERE IS ONLY ONE IS MIXTURE,IT WAS MIXTTURE BUT NOW YOU HAVE SEPPERATED EVERYTHING TO WEAR THERE AS ONLY ONE PILE THAT IS MICXTURED
7398,GOOD BYE,GOODBYE
7399,IT'S IMPORTANT BECAUSE ITS IMPORTANT BECAUSE THE SAND STATE IN THE FILTER AND WATER WENT DOWN,IT'S IMPORTAN'T BECAUSE IT'S IMPORTANT BECAUSE THE SAND STAYED IN THE FILTER AND THE WATER WENT DOWN

7401,GOOD HOW ARE YOU,GOOD HOW ARE YO
7402,THAT WHEN YOU POUR WATER AND THE SALT IT EXHAUST AND DISAPPEARS,THAT WHEN YOU POUR WATER IN THE SAULT IT DESOLVES AND DISAPPEARES
7403,YES,YES
7404,TO DISSOLVING INTO OTHER THINGS LIKE MATERIAL,E DEVOLVING INTO OTHER THINGS K MATERIAL
7405,THAT IT HAS TREATED FROM BEING A MIXTURE,THAT IT HASRADED FROM BEING A MIXTURE

7409,WELL IT LOOKS LIKE IT LOOKS LIKE THAT THERE WAS,BULL IT LOOKS LIKE IT LOOKS LIKE THAT THERE S
7410,ITS IMPORTNAT BECAUSE WE ARE SEPARATING THE STUFF AND BECAUSE SO WE KNOW WHAT MIXTURE,IT'S IMPORTANT BECAUSE WE ARE SEPPERATING THE STUFF AND BECAUSE SO WE KNOW WHAT MIXTURES
7411,THAT WHEN TWO ARE MORE THINGS ARE PUT TOGETHER ITS CALLED A MIXTURE,THAT WHEN TWO OR MORE THINGS AIRE R PUT TOGETHER IT'S CALLED A MICXTURE

7883,UM THE ONE ON THE LEFT SIDE IS BALANCED UPRIGHT AND THEN THE ONE ON THE RIGHT SIDE IS ABOUT TO SINK CAUSE IT'S UNBALANCED,ON THE ONE ON THE LEFT SIDE IS BALENCED UP RIGHT AND THEN THE ONE ON THE RIGHT SIDE IS ABOUT TO TINK CASE ITS UN BAENCED
7884,EACH ONE IS A DIFFERENT SIZE,EACH ONE IS A DIFFERENT SIZE
7885,IT MIGHT AFFECT THE NUMBER OF PASSENGERS BECAUSE IF THE WATER'S GOING ALL CRAZY THEN IT COULD CAUSE THAT CUP TO FLIP OVER,IT MIGHT EFFECT THE NUMBER OF PASSAGGERS BECAUSE F THE WATER IS GOING ALLRE CRAZY THEAN IT COULD CAUSE THE CUP TO FLIP OVER
7886,YOU NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU ALL UM THAT YOU PUT THE PENNIES IN EACH LIFEBOAT AT THE SAME HEIGHT AND LIKE NOT ALL AT THE SAME TIME LIKE ONE AT A TIME FOR EACH ONE,YOU NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU ALL UHM THAT YOU PUT THE PENNIES IN EACH LIFE BOAT AT THE SAME HIGHT AND LIKE NOT ALL AT THE SAME TIME LIKE ONE AT A TIME FOR EACH ONE
7887,THEY'RE JUST DROPPING IT IN AND THAT CAUSES THE BOAT TO GET MORE PRESSURE PUT ON IT SO IT FALLS DOWN BEFORE THE LEFT SIDE DOES,THEY'RE JUST DROPPING IT IN AND THAT CAUSES THE BOAT TO GET MORE PRESSURE PUT ON IT SO IT FALLS DOWN BEFORE THE LEFT SIDE DOES
7888,YOU WOULD PUT THE UM CUP IN THE WATER AND THEN UH PUT ONE PENNY IN AT A TIME TO SEE HOW LONG IT TOOK BEFORE IT SANK,YOU WOULD PUT THE UHM CUP IN THE WATER AND THEN UH PUT ONE PENIAN AT A TIME TO SEE HOW LONG IT TOOK BEFORE IT SANK
7889,UM YOU GOT TO MAKE SURE THERE'S NO WATER IN THE BOAT OR ELSE UM OR OR ELSE IT COULD CAUSE THE BOAT TO GO DOWN MORE THAN IT WOULD IF THERE WAS NO NO WATER IN THE CUP,UHM YOU GOT A MIXD SURE THERE'S NO WATER IN THE BOAT OR ELSE UHM OR OR ELSE IT COULD CAUSE THE BOAT TO GO DOWN MORE THAN IT WOULD IF THERE WAS N NO WATER IN THE CUP

7894,WE'VE BEEN UM MAKING LITTLE LIFEBOATS AND USING PENNIES AS PEOPLE AND DROPPING THEM IN AND SEEING HOW LONG IT TOOK FOR THE LIFEBOAT TO SINK IN WATER,WE'VE BEEN UHM MAKING LITTLE LIFE BOATS AND USING PENNIES AS PEOPLE AND DROPPING THEM IN AND SEEING HOW LONG IT TOOK FOR THE LIFE BOAT TO SINK IN WATER
7895,WELL IF IT'S IF IT'S A BIGGER UM CUP THEN IT COULD PROBABLY FIT MORE PENNIES IN BEFORE IT SINKS,WELL IF IT'S IF IT'S A BIGGER UHM CUPS TAND IT COULD PROBABLY FIT MORE PENNIES THAN BEFORE IT SINKS
7896,SO IT DOESN'T MESS UP YOUR EXPERIMENT,SO IT DOESN'T MASSH UP YOUR EXPERIMENT
7897,GROUP D HAS THE MOST PENNIES,GROUP DI HAS THE MOST PENNIES
7898,YOU HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU ONLY CHANGE ONE THING OR ELSE THAT YOU WON'T KNOW THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN OTHER THINGS THAT YOU DO CAUSE IT WOULD MESS UP THE EXPERIMENT,YOU HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU ONLY CHANGE ONE THING OR ELSE THE YOU WON'T KNOW THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN OTHER THINGS THAT YOU DO CAUSE IT WOULD MESS UP THE EXPERIMENT
7899,THEY GOT A A LOT MORE PENNIES IN THE LEFT SIDE CAUSE THEY PUT IT IN MORE CAREFULLY,THEY GOT AHM A LOT MORE PENNIES IN THE LEFT SIDE CAUSE THEY PUT IT IN MORE CAREFULLY
7900,YOU NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT EACH CUP IS EXACTLY THREE CENTIMETERS OR ELSE IT COULD CAUSE UM A BIG DIFFERENCE BETWEEN ONE CUP AND ANOTHER,YOU NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT EACH CUP IS EXACTLY THREE SEVNONMETERS OR ELSE IT COULD CAUSE UHM A BIG DIFFERENCE BETWEEN ONE CUP AND ANOTHER
7901,NOTHING,NOTHING
7902,IT HAD TO BE SMALL TO FIT IN THE TOP OF WATER,IT HAD TO BE SMALL TO FIT IN THE TUB OF WATER
7903,YOU CAN UM CHANGE THE THE HEIGHT OF THE CUP AND IT CAN HOLD MORE PENNIES THAT WAY,YOU CAN UHM CHANGE THE THE HIGHT OF THE CUP AND IT CAN HOLD MORE PENNIESE THAT WAY
7904,THERE'S MORE IN THE LEFT SIDE BECAUSE THEY STACKED IT EVENLY SO IT COULD BALANCE BETTER,THERE WAS MORE ON THE LEFT SIDE BECAUSE THEY STACKED IT EVENLY SO IT COULD BALLENCE BETTER
7905,FLOAT,FLOAT
7906,YOU CAN SEE WHEN UM WHEN THE HOW MANY PENNIES ARE IN THERE IT STARTS TO GET REALLY BY TO THE WATER AND THEN IT SINKS AFTER THE LAST PENNY GOES IN,YOU CAN SEE WHEN UHM WHEN THE HOW MANY PENNIES ARE IN THEIR I STAURTS TO GET REALLY CLOSE TO THE WATER AND THEN IT SINKS AFTER THE LAST PENNY GOES IN

7931,YES THE EARTH HAS A WHOLE BUNCH OF SYSTEMS LIKE THE BIOSPHERE THE ATMOSPHERE IT HAS CARS COMPUTERS US,YES THERS HAS HOPEIN O SISTOMS LIKE THE BILE SPERE LE ATMISFER AS CARS COMPUTERS US
7932,MATCHING UP TOGETHER SO THEY CAN SO AND THAT'S A CYCLE HOW THEY EAT EACH OTHER AND EFFECT EACH OTHER AND KILL EACH OTHER UNTIL IT GETS BACK TO POINT A,ACCHRING UP TOGETHER SO THEY CAN AND THAT'S A SLICK  OLD PAL EACH OTHER AND EXLECT EACH OTHER AND KILL EACH OTHER THE'LE GETS BACK TO POINT A
7933,ANIMALS EAT PEOPLE SO THEY GO ALL THE WAY AROUND THE CYCLE UNTIL THEY COME BACK TO POINT A,R ANIMALS EAT PEOPLE FOR THEY GO ALL R AROUNDS THEY GO UNTIL THEY COME BACK TOTHE POINT
7934,THAT THEY ALL MATCH UP TOGETHER SOMEHOW,THAT'S THE OLD MY TRIP TOGETHER F SOMEHOW
7935,IT'S A FOOD CYCLE YEAH,IT'S A FOODS LIKE G  Y
7936,THE LAYER OF THE EARTHS I SEE A BIO SYSTEM I SEE UM THE ATMOSPHERE I SEE BUILDINGS THAT HAVE A SYSTEM IN IT I SEE MOUNTAINS,THE THE LAYORS OF THAT WERE  I SEE  BIOES SISTOME I SEE ON THE ATMISFERE I SEE BUILDINGS THAT HAVE SISTOMS AND A I SEE MOUNTAINS
7937,THE WHEELS THE ENGINE AND EVERYTHING AND THEN UM ENGINE MAKES THE WHEELS MOVE SO THE CAR WILL MOVE AND DRIVE,THE WHEEL IS THE INTURN IERY SANG AND NO UHM AN TANT MIX THE WHEELES MOVE TO THE CARPO MOVE AND DRIVE

7951,GOOD,GOOD
7952,MAKE WHAT MAKES IT A SYSTEM IS THE INTERACTING PARTS LIKE THE WHEELS EXHAUST AND THE DRIVETRAIN AND WINDSHIELD SEAT BELT CHAIRS THEY ALL WORK TOGETHER TO MAKE THE ONE SYSTEM A CAR,MAKES WHAT MAKE IT THIS SISTOME IS THE INTERACTING PARTS LIKE THE WHEELS EXOUST AND DRY TRAINE AND WHIN SHIELDS SEET BT SHARS THAT 'LL WORK TOGETHER TO MAKE THE ONE SISTOM A CAR
7953,THIS HAS TO DO WITH SYSTEMS BECAUSE IF THESE PARTS LIKE THE EXHAUST I MEAN THE DRIVETRAIN THE EXHAUST AND THE WHEELS WEREN'T THERE AND OTHER STUFF THE CAR WOULD WOULDN'T EVEN BE ABLE TO MOVE,THIS HAS TO DO WITH SISTOMS BECAUSE IF THESE PARTS LIKE BE EGOST I MEAN THE DRIVE TRAIN BE EXSOST AND THE WHEEL IS WERN'T BEARE AN OTHER STUFF THE CAR WOULD WOULDN'T EVEN BE ABLE TO MOVE
7954,IN SCIENCE WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT SYSTEMS THE FOOD CHAIN FOOD WEBS STUFF LIKE THAT,IN SCIENCE WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT UHM SISTUMS THE FOOD CHAIN FOOD WEBS UHM STOPP LIKE THAT
7955,AWESOME,OSOME
7956,I SAW AND HEARD THAT THE DING THEY ARE ALL SLEEPING AND THEN THE DING DONG WOKE THEM UP AND THE DOG STARTS BARKING BECAUSE HE STARTED ALL THE HUMAN IS LIKE I JUST WANT TO GO BACK TO SLEEP,I SAW AND HEARD UHM THAT THE DIDN'T THEYERE ALL SLEEPING AND THEN THETING DONG AWOKE THEM UP AND THE DOG STARTS BARKING BECAUSE HE STARTLED THE HUMANS LIKE I JUST WANT TO GO BACK TO SLEEP
7957,THE REACTION IS IF HE HEARS OR SEES THE LITTLE MOSQUITO LAND ON HIM AND THEN HE BRINGS DOWN HIS HAND TO KILL IT SO IT DOESN'T KILL IT DOESN'T HARM HIM AND HE GOES,THE REACTION IS HE HE HE S HE HEARES OR SEES THE LITTLE MISKEO LANDS ON HIM AND THEN HE BRINGS DOWN HIS HAND TO KILL IT SO IT DOESN'T KILL THAT DOESN'T HARM HIM AND HE GOES
7958,SO THE MAIN POINTS WAS CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM RESPONDS AND STIMULUS,SOM OF THE MAIN POINTS WERE ESENTIAL NERVOUS NES SOME RESPONCE AND STIMULU
7959,CONTROL NERVOUS SYSTEM IS BASICALLY THE BODY'S THING SO THE BRAIN SENDS SOMETHING LIKE HE WANTS THE FOOT TO MOVE FORWARD AND THE FOOT MOVES FORWARD BECAUSE OF THE NERVES AND THE ELECTRIC IMPULSES RUNNING THROUGH THE NERVES,ATRAL NERVOUS SISTOM IS BACICALY THE BODYS THINK SO THET BRAINS SINS SOMETHING LIKE HE WANTS TO FLIT TO MOVE FORWARD AND AFOUT MOVES FORWARD BECAUSE OF THE NURVES IN THE ELECTRIC IMPULES RUNNING THROUGH THE N

7962,BRAIN TELLS THE SENDS THE MESSAGE TO THE MOTOR NEURONS THEY GO THROUGH THE SPINAL CORD AND LIKE THE ELECTRIC IMPULSES TO THE MOTOR NEURONS AND THEN THE MUSCLES MOVE,SRAINE TELLS THE SENDS THE MESSAGE TO THE MOTER NERONS BET GOES TO THIS FINAL CORT IN THE LECTRIC IMPULSES TO THE MOTR ERONS AND THEN THE MUSCLES MOVE
7963,THIS IS SHOWING US THE BEE GIVING CERTAIN DIRECTIONS TO ALL OTHER FRIENDS TO LIKE A FLOWER GARDEN THEY'RE ALL GOING TO GO THERE THEY'RE GOING TO TELL THEY'RE OTHER FRIENDS AND THEN THAT'S GOING TO BE A LIKE A BIG V PARTY THERE,THIS IS SHOWING US TO BEAT GIVE INNG CERTAN DIRECTIONS TO ALL HIS OTHER FRIENDS WHO LIKE A FLOWUR GARDEN AND THE'RE ALL GOING TO GO TO BEAR THER RIG TO TELL ALL THER OTHER FRIENDS AND THE ENDAT'S GIVE YOU LIKE A BIG BE PARTY THER
7964,IF THAT BEE DIDN'T DO THAT THEN THEY WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO FIND ANYMORE OR THE FLOWERS THEY'RE ALL GO TO ONE CERTAIN FLOWER AND TELL THEY'RE ALL IF THAT FLOWER IS GONE THEN THEY'RE GONE,IF THAT BEEADIDN'T DO THAT MEN THEY WOULDN'T BE AL TO FIND ANY MOOR THE FLOWERS THEY HOULD ALL GO TO ONE CERTAN FLOWER UNTILL THEY ALL TO FLO IF THAT FLOWER WAS GONE DIDN' THEY GONE
7965,THE GUY ACCIDENTALLY KNOCKED OVER THE BOWL OF JUICE AND THAT WAS THE STIMULUS AND THEY WHEN THEY GET NICE SHIRT IT WAS QUITE STAINED AND SO WHEN THAT STIMULUS HE QUICKLY JUMPED OUT SO MORE THEN GET ON HIS,THE GUY ACCIDENALLY KNOCKED OVE THE BOTTLE OF JHESE AND THAT WAS THE STIMULUSSIN THAY THEN THEY GWHEN IT GETS ON THEY GUTYS SURE IT WAS FRIGH STAINED AND SO WHEN THAT STIMULUS HE QUICKLY JUMPED UP SOM MORE THA GET ON HIS SH
7966,THE STIMULUS WAS THE PIECE THAT GRAPE JUICE FALLEN OVER AND YEAH THEN A GUY JUMPING UP REAL FAST WAS THE RESPONSE,THE STIMULISS WAS TH PIECE THATHAT GREAT JUCE FALLING OVER AND THEN AH Y THE GUY JUMPEDG UP REAL FAST WAS THE A RESPONSE
7967,SEE THIS LITTLE PRETTY DOG AS SEE THE LUNCH AND HE'S GOING INTO ATTACK MODE AND SAYING BACK OFF I'M READY TO STRIKE OR HE SWINGS THIS IS NO POTENTIAL PREDATOR HE SAYS BACK OFF I CAN DEFEND MYSELF,SEESE THIS LITTLE PREARY DOGGAT AS ETHER LUNCH RIN HE'S GOING INTO AT TACK MOADE AND SAYING BACK OFF I'M READY TO STRIKE OR HE S THINKS THIS IS NO PATENCIAL PREDITER HE SAYS BACK OFF I CAN DEFEND MYSELF
7968,THIS IS UHM LOOKS LIKE WIND AND IT I DON'T THINK THAT PLANTS NEED WIND TO,THIS IS UHM LOOKS LIKE WINDS AND I I DON'T THINK THAT PLANTS NEED WIND TO SERV
7969,THING ABOUT PRODUCERS AND FOOD WEBS IS WITHOUT THE PRODUCERS EVERYTHING IS GOING TO DIE EVENTUALLY EVERYTHING'S GOING TO BE KILLED OFF BECAUSE THERE'S NO BASIC FOOD SOURCE THAT THE PRODUCERS GIVE,THING ABOUT PRODUCERS AND FOOD WEBS IS WITHOUT THE PRODUCERS EVERYTHING IS GOING TO DI OVENTUALLY EVERYTHING IS GOING TO BE KILLED OFF BECAUSE THERE'S NO BAIC FOOD SORS THAT THE PRODUCERVES GIF
7970,PLANTS NEED A PLACE TO LIVE SO THEY CAN'T JUST BE FLOATING IN AIR IN THE OCEAN THEY NEED A SUITABLE PLACE TO LIVE,PLANTS NEED A PLACE TO LIVE STHEY CAN'T JUST BE FLOATING IN MID AIR IN THE OCEAN THEY NEED A SUTABLE PLACE TO LIV
7971,YES THIS PLANT NEEDS WATER TO SURVIVE,YES THIS PLANT NEEDS WATER TO SURV
7972,IT AHS EVERYTHING IT NEEDS TO GROW IT HAS WATER CARBON DIOXIDE AND SUNLIGHT THAT MEANS THAT IT IS ABLE TO DO STUFF,HAS EVERYTHING IT NEEDS TIGROW IT HAS WATER CARMANDY ACKCIDE AND SUNLIGHTE THAT MEANS IT IT IS ABLE TO DO STUFF
7973,WHAT'S GOING ON IS THE YEAST IS UHM BEING BREAKING ITS DORMANCY WITH THE SUGAR FROM THE GRAHAM CRACKER,WHAT'S GOING ON IS THE YEAST IS UHMBEING BREAKING ITS NORMANCY WITH THE SHUGER FROM THE GRAND CRACK
7974,THEY MAKE THEIR FOOD THROUGH PHOTOSYNTHESIS SO THEY TAKE THE LIGHT ENERGY AND THEY MAKE IT INTO UHM THEY TAKE UHM THE LIGHT ENERGY AND THEY MAKE IT INTO SUGARS,THEY MAKE THEIR FOOD THROUGH POTA CENPACES SO THEY TAKE TE LIGHT ENERGY AND THEY CMAKE IT IN CHE INS UHM THEY TAKE UHM THE THE LIGHT ENERGY AND THEY MAKE IT INTO SHUGERS
7975,THE PLANT NEEDS UHM CARBON DIOXIDE UHM SUN HEAT AND H O TWO,THE PLANT NEEDS UHM CARMON BY OCKSIDE UHM SUN HEATS AND ACHO TO HER
7976,THIS ONE IS UHM SUN OR LIGHT AND HEAT AND THE PLANT NEEDS HEAT AND NO A LITTLE BIT OF HEAT BUT MOSTLY LIGHT TO SURVIVE,SONE IS SUHME SUN OR LIGHTS AND THE HEAT AND THE PLANT NEEDS HEAT AND AO A LITTLE BIT OF HEAT BUT MOSTLY LIGHT TO SURVIVE
7977,IT HAS ALL THE STUFF IT NEEDS TO DO ITS BASIC FUNCTIONS SUNLIGHT CARBON DIOXIDE AND WATER,THAT HAS ALL A STUFF INT NEED TO DO ITS PACIC FUNTIONS SUNLIGHT CARMON DY OCKSIDE AND WATER

7979,WE HAVE BEEN STUDYING ABOUT HOW UH PLANTS GET THEIR FOOD AND THEIR NUTRITION,YWE HAVEN'T STUDYING ABOUT HOW ANU PLANTS GET THEIR FOOD AND THEIR NETRISIO
7980,SOME OF THE MAIN POINTS ARE WHAT PLANTS NEED TO GROW UHM THAT'S PRETTY MUCH THE MAIN POINT THAT WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT,SOME OF THE MAIN POINTS ARE WHAT PLANTS NEED SHOULD GROW UHM THAT'S PRETTY MUCH IN THE MAIN PAINE WHAT WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT
7981,YOU DOING TODAY MARNI,BE DOING TODAY MOR
7982,YEAST IS A FUNGI THAT UHM IS USED IN BREAD,EAST IS A FUNGY THAT UHM IS USED IN BREAD
7983,THAT MAKES IT UNABLE TO SOME SIMPLE UHM LIKE FUNCTIONS LIKE BEING ABLE TO STAY ALIVE BECAUSE IT NEEDS CARBON DIOXIDE TO BE ABLE TO PRODUCE ENERGY,THAT MAKES IT UN ABLE TO DO SOME SIMPLE UHM LIKE FUNTIONS LIKE BEING ABLED TO STAY ALIVE CAUSE THE NEEDS CAR CARBN BY OSIDE TO BE ATO PRODUCE ENEARGY
7984,GOING ON IS IT HAS WATER WHICH IS GOOD IT HAS SUNLIGHT BUT IT HAS NO CARBON DIOXIDE SO THE PLANT IS NOT BEING ABLE TO FUNCTION WITHOUT THE CARBON DIOXIDE,OON ATS IT HAS WATER WHICH IS GOOD IT HAS SUNLIGHT BUTIT HAS NO CARMONDYOCKSIDE SO IT THE PLAN IS NOT BEING ABLE T OF FUNTION WITH OU THE CARM DIOKSIDE
7985,PLANTS NEED THINGS LIKE CARBON DIOXIDE TO HELP UHM CREATE ENERGY THE WATER IS USED FOR ENERGY AND THE LIGHT IS USED FOR ENERGY,PLANTS NEED THINGS LIKE CARMIN DIOSIDE TO HELP UHM TREE ENERGY THE WATER IS USED WITH OR ENERGY AND ALIGHT IS USED FOR ENERGY
7986,WILTED IS THE NAME SAME THING FOR LIKE DRIED UP NO WATER MEANS IT'S PRETTY WILTED,WILLTI IS THE NAME TH SAME THING FOR LIKE DRIED UP NO WATER MEANS IT'S PRETTY WILTED
7987,THE PLANT HAS SUN IT HAS AIR BUT IT DOESN'T HAVE ANY WATER OR IT WASN'T GIVEN ANY WATER SO THAT MEANS THAT IT HAS NO WATER TO HELP THE PLANT GROW,THE PLANT HAS SUN IT HAS AIR BUT IT DOESN'T HAVE ANY WATER OR ITHA DESN'T GIVEN ANY WATER SO THAT MEANS THAT HAS NO WATER TO HELP THE PLANT GROW
7988,THAT MEANS A BEAR IS AN OMNIVORE,THAT MEANS TO BEAR IS AN OBNUBLE
7989,PLANTS ARE PRODUCERS BECAUSE THEY MAKE THEIR OWN FOOD THROUGH PHOTOSYNTHESIS FROM THE SUN AND THEY ALL AND IF THEY IF YOU TAKE AWAY THE PLANTS SLOWLY THE WHOLE FOOD CHAIN WILL COLLAPSE,PLANTS ARE PRODUCERS BECAUSE THEY MAKE THEIR OWN FOOD O TOATAL SEN FOURSNESS FROM THE SUN AND THEY ALL N UHM A IF THEY IF YOU TAKE AWAY THE PLANTS S SLOWLY THE WHOLE FLOUD CHAME WILL COLLAPS
7990,A MOOSE IS A HERBIVORE BECAUSE IT EATS LITTLE GRASS OUT OF THE LAKES AND IT EATS TREES TOO,A MOOSE IS A ERB OF WATER BECAUSE IT EATS UHM LITTLE GRASS OUT OF THE LEGS AND IT EATS TREES TO
7991,IT HAS TO DO WITH WHAT WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT BECAUSE IT'S ALL ABOUT THE CARNIVORES AND ALL THAT STUFF AND HOW THEY HOW THEY STAY ALIVE,IT HAS TO DO WELL WE BEEN TALKING ABOUT BECAUSE IT'S ALL ABOUT THE CARED BOARDS UHM I ALL THAT STUFFS AND HOW THEY HOW THEY STAY AL
7992,HERBIVORES MEANS YOU EAT ONLY PLANTS NOTHING ELSE,ERBBRS MEAN THAT YOU EAT ONLY PLANTS NOTHING ELSE
7993,CONNECTS TO BEING A CARNIVORE BECAUSE IT CARNIVORES ONLY EAT MEAT THAT MEANS THEY'RE A SECOND LEVEL CONSUMER OR HIGHER BECAUSE YEAH,CANNECT T BEING A CARNOT BAR BECAUSE IT EAT CARBOARDS ONLY EAT MEAT THAT MEANS AR A SECOND LEVEL CONSTUMER OR HIGHER BECAUSE UHM YEAH
7994,THE DECOMPOSERS ARE THE MUSHROOMS AND THE BACTERIA IN THIS PICTURE,THE DEEP COMPOSURES ARE THE MUSHROOMS IN THE BACK TAREIA IN THIS PICTURE
7995,TO THE ENVIRONMENT CAUSE IT WOULD BE WHAT THEY REALLY DO IN REAL LIFE EXCEPT THEY MIGHT BE DOING IT WITH DEAD BODIES AND NOT NEWSPAPER AND THEY WOULD PROBABLY BE STILL BE DOING THAT WITH LEAVES AND ALL THAT,SHOLD THE ENVIRONMENT CAUSE IT WOULD BE WHAT THEYE REALLY DO IN REAL LIFE EXCEPT THEY MIGHT BE DOING OF DEAD BODIES ILD NOT NEWSPAPERAND THEY WOUD TPRY  T STILL BE DOING  LEAVES IN ALL THATS
7996,THE MISSING TYPE OF ORGANISM IS A DECOMPOSER BECAUSE THERE'S ONLY BACTERIA IN THIS PICTURE AND I KNOW THERE'S MORE THAN JUST BACTERIA THAT CAN DECOMPOSE DEAD,THE MISTUNTYPE OF ORGONISOME IS A DEECOMPOSURE BECAUSE UHM THERE'S ONLY A BACTARA AND THIS PICTURE AND I KNOW THERE'S MORE THAN JUST BAC ARIA THAT CAN DE COMPOSED DEAD ANIM
7997,THE PRODUCERS ARE THE PINE CONE AND THE TREES AND THE GRASS BECAUSE THEY ALL MAKE THEIR FOOD FROM PHOTOSYNTHESIS,THE PRODUCERS ARE THE PINE CONE AND THE TREES AND THE GRASSBECAUSE THEY ALL MAKE THEIR FOOD F THES INPACISS
7998,ALMOST ALL PLANTS EXCEPT FOR THE VENUS FLY TRAPS ARE PRODUCERS,ALMOST ALL PLANTS EXCEPT FOR THE VENUS FLY TRAPS I'M PRETTY SURE ARE PRODUCERS
7999,A THING A PRODUCE ORGANISM THAT HAS TO EAT OTHER THINGS TO STAY ALIVE IS A CONSUMER,A THING UHM A PRODUCE UH ORGONISOME THAT HAS TO EAT OTHER THINGS TO UHM STAY ALIVE AS A CONSUMER

8468,THAT ONE OF THE LIGHT BULBS BROKE,THAT WHAT A THE LIGHE BALLS BROKE
8469,THE LIGHT THE TWO LIGHT BULBS ARE LIGHTING BECAUSE THE OTHER ONE IS BROKEN AND THEN WHAT THEY DO WHAT THEY WILL WAS IT DOESN'T WORK,ADOTHE IT  UH DELIGHT THE T LIGHE BUBS ARE LIGHTING BECAUSE THE THER O IS BROKEN AND THEN LHAT THE NEW WWHAT TO DO WA IT DOES WORK
8470,THERE WERE THE LIGHT BULBS WERE LIGHTING BUT THERE IS THE OTHER ONE BROKE AS THEY DID A STUFF LIGHT I GET THAT THEY GOT IT OTHER ONE AND IT STARTED LIGHTING AND THAT,UH THEY WERE THE LIGHPLES WERE LIGHTING BUT THEN THE OTHER WOD BROKE AND THEY DIDN'T STOP LIGHTING AND THEN THEY CAUGHT ADOTHER ONE AND JI STARTED LIGHTING AGAIN
8471,BREAK,BRA
8472,BULB STARTS WORKING BECAUSE LIKE WITH THE SWITCH WAS OUT IT WAS HOLD THAT ENERGY FROM THE LIGHT BULB,UM STARTED WORKING BECAUSE LIKE WHEN THE SWISH WAS OUT IT WAS HOLDING THE ENERGY BACK FROM THE WHIGT FAL
8473,WORK ANYMORE BECAUSE IT'S STANDARD IS DOESN'T WORK,DON'T WORK ANYMORE BECAUSE IT'S STEADED IT'S DOESN' WOR

8485,ITS STARTS TO MOVE BECAUSE IT'S LIKE LIKE HAPPY ITS ENERGY,IT STARTS TO MOVE BECAUSE IT'S LIKE LIKE HAPPY IT'S GETTING ANE
8486,I SEE THAT THE MOTOR IS MOVING BECAUSE WHEN I PUT THE PAPER CLIP ON TOP OF THE SWITCH IT STARTED TO MOVE,I SEE THAT THE MOTOR IS MOVING BECAUSE WELL NOT PUT THE PIPER CLIP ON TOP OF THE SWISH IT STARTED TO MOVE
8487,BECAUSE IT'S NOT A SOURCE OF ELECTRICITY OR A PIECE OF ENERGY,BECAUSE IT'S NOT A SORTS OF AF CITY OR A PIECE OF ATA
8488,GOOD,ED
8489,THE MOTOR IS MOVING ITS LITTLE FLAG BECAUSE THE SWITCH IS TURNED ON,THE MOTOR IS MOVING ITS LITTLE FLAG BECAUSE THE SWISH IS TURNED
8490,THE CIRCUIT WILL RUN BECAUSE IT IS LIKE ITS METAL AND IN ORDER FOR IT TOWARDS THAT NEEDS METAL,THE CIRCUET WILL RUN BECAUSE IT'S LIKE IT'S MEDDAL AND IN ORDER FOR IT TO WORK IT NEEDS MEDDAL
8491,ALL INSIDE IT AND THEN IT WANT,PULE ECITED AND THEN TE WON'T
8492,I MEAN THAT IS NOT GETTING ENERGY BECAUSE THE SWITCH IS AT ON AND THE WOOD STICK IS LIKE ISN'T A TYPE OF METAL SO IT WON'T WORK,IT MEANS THAT ISNNOT GETTING ENERGY BECAUSE THE SWISH IS AN ON AND THE WOOD STICK IS AN NAKE ISN'T A TYPE OF METTAL SO IT IT WON'T WOR
8493,CONDUCTING MATERIALS ARE HELPFUL BUT THE REST OF THAT AREN'T WHERE IT'S TO OTHER WAY OVER CAN YOU TELL THAT MARNIE,UHM CONDUCTING MATERIALS OR HELP FULL BUT THE REST OF THEM AREN'T OR IT'S TO OTHER WAY RUN CAN YOU TELL ME THAT MOR NEED
8494,THAT WHEN YOU PUT THE WOOD ON THE WOOD STICK IT IS NOT WORKING ANYMORE BECAUSE IT'S NOT TYPE OF METAL OR ITS TYPE OF SOURCE TO MAKE IT,THAT WHEN YOU PUT THE WOULD WOOULD UHM THE WOOD STICK IT ISN'T WORKHING ANYMORE BECAUSE IT'S NOT A TYPE OF METAL OR  TYPE LOF SOURCE TO MAKE IT
8495,IT DOESN'T WORK BECAUSE IT'S NOT LIKE STORE OF ENERGY AND BECAUSE A BATTERY WORKS BECAUSE THAT HAS STORED ENERGY INSIDE IT SO,IT DOESN'T WORK BECAUSE IT'S NOT ASORE OF ENERGY AND  BECAUSE A BATTERY WORKS BECAUSE IT HAS DOT ENERGY INSIDE IT SO
8496,I SAID THAT YOU NEED A BATTERY WHICH HAS STORED ENERGY INSIDE IT AND THEN YOU NEED TWO WIRES A SWITCH AND A MOTOR,I UHM SAID THAT YOU NEED A BATTERY WICH HESTOLED ENGY INSIDE IT AND THEN UHM YOU NEED TWO WIRORS OF SWISH AND MOTOR
8497,WELL I THINK THAT THE LIGHT THE DOTS ARE THE ENERGY AND LIKE THAT'S WAS JUST SPEAKING THE LIGHT BULB BRIGHTER,WELL UHM I THINK THAT THE LAK THE DOTS ARE THE ENERGY AND THETHAT WAS MAKING A LIGH FALL IDER
8498,IT'S JUST TO BE IN A CIRCLE IS VERY HELPFUL BECAUSE THEY HAS BECAUSE THE BATTERY IS GIVING IN ENERGY TO THE D CELL THAT'S HOW THE LIGHT BULB IS GETTING THE ENERGY IMPROVEMENT,USTIDIN  TIRCUTE IS VERY HELPFUL BECAUSE IT HAS BECAUSE IT THE BATTERYIS GEVTING A UM ENERGY TO THE DEESAILE NESS OF THE TO OF LIFE BOLB IS GETTING THE ENRGY BOARM AT
8499,I DON'T KNOW,I DON'T KNO
8500,THAT WHEN THOSE ONE LIGHT BULB IT JUST ONE FOCUS AND LIKE WHEN THERE IS A ONE BATTERY IT DOESN'T LIGHT AS MUCH AS THE SECOND ONE BECAUSE THERE IS TWO FOR EACH ONE,BAT WHEN THERE'S ONE LIKE BALL IT'S JUST ONE FOK IS AND TLIKE WHEN THERE'S ONE BATTERY IT DOESN'T LIGHT AS MUCH AS THE SECOND ONE BECAUSE THERE'S STUPER EACH ONE
8501,ITS IT WAS THE LIGHT BULBS TURN BRIGHTER BECAUSE IT'S USING TWO BATTERIES AND SO THAT IS TWO STORED ENERGIES INTO LIGHT BULBS,IT'S UHM IT WAS THE LIGHE BOBBS TURNED BRIGHTER BECAUSE IT'S USING TO FETTERES AND SO THE IS CUZE TORED IN HERCHISE IN TO LIGHE BUBS
8502,THERE ARE ONE TWO THREE FOUR THERE IS FOUR PATH WAYS TO A SERIES CIRCUIT,THERE ARE ONE TWO THREE FOUR THERE'S FOUR PATH WAYS TO A SERIOUS SCIRCUL
8503,I THINK THE WORK MAY BE,UHM I THINK YOULL WORK MAYBE
8504,THE ENERGY STORED IN THAT BECAUSE IT'S GIVING ENERGY TO THE LIGHT BULBS,UHM THE ENERGY IS STWORED AND STUFED BECAUSE IT'S GIVING ENEARGY TO THE IBBS
8505,I THINK THE LIGHT BULBS ARE GOING TO BE BRIGHTER BECAUSE IT'S USING TO TUBE A D CELLS AND LIKE THEY HAVE STORED ENERGY SO IT WILL WORK,I THINK THE LIPPALBS ARE GOING TO BE BRIGHTER BECAUSE IT'S USING TO TO UHM DEESELLS AND LIKE THEY HAVE SORT ENERGY SO IT WORK
8506,CAN YOU REPEAT THAT,PENIN CAN YURY UHM

9039,UM WE ADDED MORE WELL WE HAD SPACERS AND WASHERS AS YOU KNOW AND WE PUT THE SPACERS BETWEEN THE MAGNETS AND THE WASHERS ON THE OTHER END,UHM WE ADDED MORE WELL WE HAD SPACERS AND WATERS AS YOU KNOW AND WE PUT THE SPACERS BETWEEN THE MAGNETS AND THE WATERS ON THE OTHER AND
9040,IT HAS TOO MANY WASHERS SO THAT THE MAGNETS LOSE THEIR MAGNETIC FIELD,IT HAS TOO MANY WATERS SO THAT THE MAGNETS LEW THEIR MAGNETIC FIELD
9041,WE UM GROUP A GROUP B AND GROUP D HAVE THE SAME RESULTS CAUSE THEY PROBABLY DID THE SAME THING AND GROUP C HAS REALLY LOW UM,UHM GROUP A GROUPP AND GROUPT HAVE THE SAME RESULT BECAUSE THEY PROBABLY DID THE SAME THING AND GROUPS C HAS REALLY LOW UHM
9042,GETTING FURTHER APART,AREGETTING FURTHER APPART
9043,WELL THEY HAD BETTER UM,WELL THEY HAD BETTER UHM
9044,YEAH BECAUSE THERE WAS SUCH A BIG DROP LIKE FROM NINETEEN NINE THAT'S TEN WASHERS SO TH THE SPACERS MUST HAVE A A LOT OF USE,YEAH BECAUSE IT WAS SUCH A BIG DROP LIKE FROM NINE TO TEEN TO NINE THAT'S TEN  WATERS SO THE SSPACERS MUST HAVE HAD  A LOT OF YUSE

9048,WE HAVE BEEN UM WE HAVE BEEN TESTING THE STRENGTH OF THE MAGNETS,WE HAVE BEEN UHM WE HAVE BEEN TESTING THE STRENGTH AND MAGNETS
9049,MAGNETS GET FURTHER APART BECAUSE THE MORE UM SPACERS YOU PUT IN BETWEEN THE UM LESS ROOM THEY HAVE,MAGONETS GET FURTHER UPART BECAUSE THE MORE UHM SPACERS YOU PUT THIM BETWEEN THE UHM LESS ROOM THEY HAVE
9050,THEY SHOULD DO THE SAME THINGS,THEY SHOULD DO THE SAME THINGS
9051,WASHERS WERE HEAVY AND THEY MADE THE MAGNETS LOSE THEIR STRENGTH,WATERS WERE HEAVY AND THEY MADE THE MAGNETS LEZE THEIR STRENGTH
9052,YEAH BECAUSE THEN IT WOULD KIND OF UM HIT THE CUP AND THEN THE MAGNETS WOULD KIND OF SEPARATE BECAUSE OF THE FORCE AND THEN THEY WOULD COME BACK TOGETHER,YAH BECAUSE THEN IT WOULD KIND OF UHM HIT THE CUP AND THEN THE MAGNETS WOULD KIND OF SEPPERATE BECAUSE OF THE FOREST AND THEN THEY WOULD COME BACK TOGETHER
9053,IT'S BROKEN BECAUSE UM THE WASHER'S THROWN IN THERE SO HARD THAT IT KIND OF FORCES THAT CUP DOWN AND THE OTHER CUP TO COME WITH THE MAGNET TO SEPARATE FROM THE OTHER MAGNET,IT'S BROKEN BECAUSE UHM THE WATER IS THROWN IN THEYRE SO HARD THAT IT KIND OF FORCES THAT CUP DOWN AND THE OTHER CUP TO COME WITH THE MAGNET TO SEPPERATE FROM THE OTHER MAGNET
9054,THE MAGNETIC THE MAGNETS GET WEAKER AND WEAKER AS THE WASHERS GET AS THE MORE WASHERS GET IN THE OTHER CUP,THE MAGNETTIC THE MAGNETS GET WEEKER AND WEEKER AS THE WATERS GET AS THE MORE WATER S GET ING THE OTHER CUP
9055,C DIDN'T,SEEDED
9056,YOU NEED TO FOLLOW THE DIRECTIONS OR WHATEVER YOU'RE BEING TOLD TO DO CORRECTLY OR ELSE YOU'LL GET REALLY DIFFERENT RESULTS,YOU NEED TO FOLLOW THE DIRECTIONS OR WHATEVER YOU'R BEING TOLD TO DO CORRECTLY OR ELSE YOU'LL GET REALLY DIFFERENT RESULTS

9292,THIS IS THE D CELL BATTERY,S IS THE DEESAIL BATTERY
9293,WELL WHEN YOU DON'T HOOK IT UP RIGHT WITH THE WIRES AND THE BATTERY AND THE LIGHT BULBS,WEL WHEN YOU DON'T HOOK IT UP RIGHT WITH THE WIRES AND THE BATTERY AND THE LIGE BUBS
9294,YES,YES
9295,YEAH,I DON'TKNOW
9296,WELL THE ENERGY COMES FROM THIS SIDE INTO THE LIGHT BULB,WELL THE ENERGY COMES FROM THIS SIDE INTO THE LIGHTBUB
9297,WELL WE WERE SUPPOSED TO USE ONE BUT OUR GROUP THOUGHT MAYBE TWO BATTERIES FOR TWO LIGHT BULBS BUT THAT DIDN'T REALLY WORK SO WE TOOK ONE D CELL,WELL WE WERE UPPOSED TO USE ONE BUT OUR GROUP THAGT MAYBE TOO BATTERYS FOR TO LIGTE BULBS BUT THAT DIDN'T REALLY WORK SO WE TOOK ONEDAY SE
9298,YEAH,NOW
9299,YES SOMETIMES,YES SOMETIMES
9300,YEAH,AM
9301,PROBABLY RIGHT HERE,PROBABLY RIGHTE HERE
9302,YEAH KIND OF WE WERE LIKE UH MAYBE THIS ISN'T THE RIGHT WAY TO DO IT,YEAH KIND OF WE RELLIKE AU MAYBE THIS THE RIGHT WAY TO DO IT
9303,AND THEN THIS CONNECTS TO THE SWITCH,AND THEN THIS CONNECTSD TO THE SWITSH
9304,YEAH,YES
9305,THE SWITCH IS WORKING IT'S A CLOSED CIRCUIT WHEN THE SWITCH IS WORKING AND WHEN IT'S OPEN IT'S AN OPEN CIRCUIT AND OPEN CIRCUITS DON'T WORK SO WHEN YOU LIFT IT UP IT WON'T WORK CAUSE IT'S AN OPEN CIRCUIT,THE SWISH IS WORKING IT'S A CLOSE CIRCET WHEN THI SWICH IS WORKING AND WHEN IT'S OPENE IT'S AN OPEN CIRCET IN THE OPEN CIRCET STILT WORK SO WHEN YOU LIFT IT UP IT WODN'T WORK CAUSE IT'S AN OPEN CIRCE
9306,AND THIS HOOKS UP TO THE LIGHT BULB CHAMBER,ESICS UP TO THE LIGHT BALL CHAMBER
9307,IT'S HERE AND THAT,SERE IND THETHERE WAOHA H
9308,THAT'S A SWITCH AND THEN THESE ARE WHERE YOU CONNECT THE WIRES,THAT'S A SWISH AND THEN THESE AR WAY TO CONECT THE WIRES
9309,I THINK SO MAYBE,I THINK SO MAYBE
9310,WELL,WELL
9311,OKAY,A
9312,WELL,WILL
9313,AND WE PROBABLY TOUCHED THE SWITCH TO,WOULD PROBABLY ATTATCH THE SWISH TO
9314,WELL,O
9315,MOST OF THEM YEAH,MOST OF AMBIA
9316,HERE INTO THE OTHER,HER INTO THE OTHER
9317,OKAY,TA
9318,THAT HAVING TWO BATTERIES WOULD BE KIND OF HARDER SINCE YOU HAVE TWO LIGHT BULBS IT WOULD SEEM TO BE EASIER BUT BECAUSE WE HAVE TWO MORE ONE MORE TO H BATTERY TO HANDLE IT'S A LITTLE BIT HARDER,THET HAVING TWO PATTERS WOULD BE KIND  HARDER SINCE YOU HAVE TO LIGHT BUBS O ID SEEM TO BE EASIER BUT BECAUSE WE HAVE TWO MORE ONE MORE TA BATTERY TO HANDLE IT'S A LITTLE BIT HARDER
9319,UM IT'S NOT CONNECTED SO THERE'S NO USUALLY A CIRCUIT WOULD GO LIKE THIS IT'S FULL,HM IT'S NOT CONECTED SO THERE'S NO USALLY A CIRCOT TO GO LIKE THIS IT'S FULL
9320,AND IT GOES THROUGH,AND IT GOES THROUGH TH
9321,ENERGY AND THEN IT GOES OUT,ENERGY AND THEN IT GOES OUT
9322,THIS IS THE POSITIVE SIDE AND THIS IS THE NEGATIVE SIDE,THIS WIS THE POSITIVE SIDE AND THIS IS THE NEGGOTIVE SIDE
9323,YEAH MY TEACHER DID IT'S PARALLEL CIRCUITS WELL WE NOTICED THAT THE LIGHT BULB WHEN IT LIT UP IT WAS DULL SO PARALLEL CIRCUITS I THINK MAKE THEM LIGHT UP MORE,YEAH MY TEACHER DID IT'S PARLITTLE SURCUTS WELL WE NOTICED THAT THE LIGHT BUB WOULDN'T LID UP IT WAS DULL SO PARELLE CUIRCUTES I THINK MAKE THEM LIGHT UP MORE
9324,WHEN YOU CONNECT IT TO THE LIGHT BULB I IT HAS TO CONNECT TO METAL TO METAL OR IT WON'T WORK,WHEN YOU CONECT IT TO THE LIGHT BOLB IT HAS TO CONNECT MEDDAL TO MEDALE U IT WOLN'T WORK
9325,THAT PARALLEL CAN NEVER TOUCH,THAT PARLELL CAND NEVER TOUCH
9326,THE SWITCH MAKES THEM TURN ON AND OFF SO MAYBE IF YOU GO UP OR DOWN YOU COULD ALWAYS COME BACK TO OFF OR ON OR,THI SWICH MAKES THEM TURN ON AND OFF SO MAYBE IF YOU GO UP OR DOWN YOU CAUN ALWAYS COME BACK TO OFFER ON THER
9327,NAH UH,AUH
9328,SO THE LIGHT BULB CAN GET ALL OF IT'S,SO THE LIFE GLUB CAN GET ALL OF ITS
9329,BECAUSE IT WAS KIND OF TOO COMPLICATED TO DO IT WITH TWO CAUSE YOU HAD TO FIGURE OUT A SPECIAL WAY WHEN WITH ONE BATTERY YOU COULD DO A WHOLE BUNCH OF WAYS,BECAUSE IT WAS KIND OF TO COMPLICATED TO DO IT WITH TOO BECAUSE YOU HAD TO FIGURE OUT A SPECIAL WAY WHEN WITH ONE BATTERE COULD DO  ONTERPLACE
9330,THE PA NEGATIVE SIDE OF THE BATTERY AND THEN THIS WOULD HAVE THE POSITIVE SIDE,THE P THE NEGOTIVE SIDE OF THE BATTER AND THEN THIS WOULD HAVE THE POSITIVE SIDE
9331,YEAH,A
9332,MMM HMM YAY,SAMI
9333,YEAH,YEAH
9334,YEAH,NA
9335,SHE COULD PUT ANOTHER BULB IN,SHE COULD PUT ANOTHER BULL BEN
9336,THE LIGHT BULB DOES NOT LIGHT UP,THE LIGHT PUL DOES NOT LIGHT UP
9337,YEAH,YEAH
9338,ONLY ONE UH A BROTHER HE'S IN COLLEGE NOW THOUGH,ONLY ONE H AH BROTHER HE'S IN' COLLAGE NOWTHO
9339,A PARALLEL CIRCUIT IS WHEN THEY NEVER TOUCH SO IF ONE BULB GOES OUT IT'LL JUST BE OUT AND ALL THE OTHERS WILL JUST KEEP GOING BECAUSE WELL IT'S ITS OWN LITTLE CIRCUIT KIND OF,A PARILELL CIRCET IS WHEN THEY NEVER TOUCH SO IF ONE BOB GOES OUT IT'L JUST BE OUT AND ALL THE OTHERS WILL JUST KEEP GOING BECAUSE WELL IS IT'S ON LITTLE CIRCET KIND OF
9340,AN OPEN CIRCUIT IS WHEN UM IS WHEN MAYBE IF YOU HAVE A SWITCH IN A SERIES CIRCUIT AND YOU LIFT IT UP IT BECOMES AN OPEN CIRCUIT AND NOTHING HAPPENS,AN OPEN CIRCET IS WHEN UHM IS WHEN MAYBE IF YOU HAVE A SWISH IN A SERY CIRCETE AND YOU LIFT IT UP IT BECOMES AN OPEN CIRCETE AND NOTHING HAPPENS
9341,WELL IT IT STOPS THE WHOLE LIGHT FROM BEING LIGHTED CAUSE IT MAKES AN OPEN CIRCUIT,WELL IT IT STOPS THE WHOLE LIGHTS FROM BEING LIGHTED BECAUSE IT MAKES AN OPEN CIRCUT
9342,PARALLEL,PERLO
9343,I THINK IT WOULD GO OUT,I THINK IT WOULD GO OUT
9344,MMM HMM YEAH,M DE
9345,YES YEAH,YES I CALLD  SYET
9346,ACTUALLY THAT ONE WOULD PROBABLY WELL,ACTUALLY THAT ONE WOULD PROBABLY OM

9349,HELLO NO YEAH,SHAL I HELNO  S HYAH
9350,SO IT WOULD COME OUT HERE AND THEN GO THROUGH HERE AND THEN COME HERE AND THEN COME THROUGH HERE EXCEPT THERE PROBABLY WOULDN'T BE ENOUGH LEFT AFTER IT WENT THROUGH OVER HERE,SO IT WOULD COME OUT HERE NDI GO THROUGH HERE AND THEN COME HERE AND THEN COME THOUGH HERE EXCEPT THEYRE PROBABLY WOULDN'T BE ENOUGH LEFT AFTER IT WENT HRUGH OVER HERE
9351,UM THEY ALL STOPPED,UHM THEY ALL STOPPED
9352,THOSE LIGHTS ARE BRIGHT E THEY'RE BRIGHTER THAN THE SERIES AND I THINK IT'S BECAUSE THEY DON'T TAKE EACH OTHER'S ELECTRICITY,THOSE LIGHTS ARE BRIGHT TEY'RE BRIGHTER THAN THE CERIES AND I THINK IT'S BECAUSE THEY DON'T TAKE EACH OTHER'S ELECTRISCITY
9353,YEP,YA
9354,SURE,SHIP
9355,THE BULB WOULD JUST STAY LIGHT,THE BUB WOULD JUST STAY LIT
9356,THE NO,THE KNEW
9357,IT HAD WAY TOO MUCH ELECTRICITY AND THEN AND THEN WHEN YOU REACHED THREE IT'LL JUST BLOW UP THE LIGHT BULB,IT HAD WAIZED TOO MUCH ELECTRISITY AND THEN AND THEN WHEN HE REACHED THREE IT'LL JUST BELO WT E LIKE BLOBE
9358,AND IT NEVER IT NEVER REALLY ACTUALLY ATTACHES WIRES TO THE OTHER LIGHT BULB,AND IT NEVER  IN NEVER REALLY ACTUALLY ATTATCHES WIERES TO THE OTHER LIKE BOT
9359,WELL IT WOULD CREATE THE ELECTRICITY TO GO STRAIGHT THROUGH,WELM I'D CREATE THE LECTRISITY TO GO STRAIGHT THROUGH
9360,WELL THE LIGHTS AT FIRST THEY WOULD GO ON THEN WHEN A FILAMENT WOULD BREAK IT WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO ALL OPEN,WELL THE LIGHTES AT FIRST THEY WOULD GO ON WHEN WHEN A FILEMANT WOULD BREAK IT WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO ALL OPEN
9361,AND THEN THIS ONE WOULD TAKE SOME OF THE ELECTRICITY AND THEN GO LIKE THIS,AND THEN THIS ONE WOULD TAKE SOME OF THE ELECTRISCITY AND THINK LIKE THIS
9362,YEAH OUR TEACHER TOLD US TO DO THAT BUT WE DIDN'T REALLY GET THE WHOLE THING I YEAH HOW DO WE WER THE PEOPLE THAT WERE MAKING A PARALLEL DIDN'T KNOW EXACTLY HOW TO DO THAT,YEAH OUR TEACHER TOLD US TO DO THAT BUT WE DIDN'T REALLY GET THE WHOLE THING I  YAH HOW WE WE THE PEOPLE THAT WERE MAKING A PARLELL DIDN'T KNOW EXACTLY HOW TO DO THAT
9363,AFTERNOON,AFTERNOON
9364,UM WELL OF COURSE THE LIGHT BULB IS PROBABLY LIGHTING UP MOST LIKELY OF COURSE AND WELL,UHM WELL OF COURSE THE LIGE BOLB IS PROBABLY LITING UP MOST LIKELY OF COURSE AND WELL

9366,YEAH,YEAH
9367,YEAH,YEH
9368,AND THEN GO BACK INTO THE LIGHT BULB TO MAKE IT GO OUT,AND THEN GO BACK INTO THE LIPOLBE TO MAKE YOU GO OUT
9369,CAUSE THEY NEVER TOUCH,CAUSE THEY NEVER TOUCHED
9370,ELECTRICITY,ELECTISITY
9371,BECAUSE IT'S AN OPEN CIRCUIT AND UM IT'S NOT ATTACHING T WELL IT'S NOT METAL TO METAL IN,BECAUSE IT'S AN OPEN CIRCUET AND UHM IT'S NOT ATTACHING WELL IT'S NOT MEDDALE TO MEDDALE IN

9544,PARTICLE SIZE AND MAGNETISM,PARTICALE SIZE ANDMAGNATISOME
9545,THE IMPORTANT PROPERTY IS MAGNETISM,THE IMPORTANT PROPERTY IS MAGNATIS
9546,I SAW THAT THE SAND I THINK WENT STAYED ON THE TOP OF THE FILTER WHEN THE WATER AND SALT WENT THROUGH,I SAW THAT THE SAND I THINK W STAYED ON THE TOP OF THE FILTER WHEN THE WATER AND THE SAULT WENT THROUG

9548,PARTICLE SIZE AND UM MAGNET MAGNETS,PLITICAL SIZE AND UHM MAGNET MAGNEN
9549,THE THE PAPER CLIPS ARE GOING TO THE MAGNET BECAUSE THEY HAVE MAGNETISM,THE MATHE PAPERCLIPS ARE GOING TO THE MAGNET BECAUSE THEY HAVE MAGNEATIZ
9550,I NOTICED THAT NONE OF THE OTHER THINGS WOULD GO WITH THE MAGNET,I NOTICED THAT NONE OF THE OTHER THINGS WOULD GO WITH THE MAGNE
9551,BECAUSE THE STONES ARE BIGGER THAN THEIR PARTICLE SIZE IS BIGGER THAN THE HOLES IN THE SEAM THING WHATEVER YOU SAID,BECAUSE THE STONES ARE BIGGER THAN THE THEY ARE PARTICALE SIZEIS PIGGLED IN THE HOLES IN THE UHM SEAM THING WHATEVER YOU SAID Y
9552,WE CAN SEPARATE MIXTURES BY USING MAGNETS FILTERS AND EVAPORATION,WE CAN SEPPERAT MIXTURES BY USING MAGNETS ILTLES AND AVAPPERATIO
9553,THINK WE USED UM A DIFFERENT THING BECAUSE THERE ARE PAPER CLIPS WHICH HAVE MAGNETITE IN THEM SO THEY WOULD GO WITH THE MAGNET INSTEAD OF JUST STAYING WITH OTHERS,I THINK WE USED UHM A DIFFERENT THING BECAUSE THERE ARE PAPERCLIPS WHICH HAVE MAGNETITE IN THEM SO THEY WOULD GO WITH THE MAGNET INSTEAD OF JUST STAYING WITH OTHER
9554,DON'T GO MARNI BYE,DON'T GO HARI B
9555,I DIDN'T NOTICE ANYTHING ELSE BUT I BUT I THINK WE USE THE FILTER BECAUSE THE STUFF STAYED ON TOP,I DIDN'T NOTICE ANYTHING ELSE BUT I BUT I THINK WE USED TO FILLTER BECAUSE THE STUFF STAYED ONTO
9556,IT IS A SOLUTION,IT IS A SULLUTION
9557,I NOTICED THAT THE SIEVE STAYED ON TOP OF THE UM THE FILTER WHEN THE OTHERS THINGS WENT DOWN,I NOTICED THAT THE SEEDS STAYED ON TOP OF THE SUHM THE FILTLE WHEN THE OTHERS THINGS WENT DO
9558,NO,NO
9559,SURE IT TWO TWO THINGS THAT KEEP THEIR PROPERTY,GUR IS TWO TWO FANGS MIX TOGETHER THAT KEEP THEIR PROPE
9560,THE ROCKS ARE STAYING ON TOP BECAUSE UM BECAUSE UM THEIR PARTICLE SIZE IS BIGGER THAN THE HOLE,THE ROCKS ARE STAYING ON TOP BECAUSE UHM BECAUSE UHM THEY ARE PARTICAL SIZE ITS BIGGLE IN THE WHOL
9561,YES,YES
9562,WE BEEN TALKING ABOUT MIXTURES AND SOLUTIONS,WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT MICXTURES AND SALLUTION
9563,DIFFERENT UM WE USE DIFFERENT TOOLS FOR DIFFERENT MIXTURES BECAUSE EACH MIXTURE HAS DIFFERENT THINGS THAT HAVE DIFFERENT PROPERTIES,DIFFFERENT UHM WE USE DIFFERENT TOLES FOR DIFFERENT MICTURES BECAUSE EACH MIXTURE HAS DIFFERENT THINGS THAT HAVE DIFFERENT PROPEARTY
9564,PROPERTY THAT'S BEING SHOWN IS PARTICLE SIZE,PROPERTY THAT'S BEING SHOWNE IS PARTICALE SI
9565,I NOTICED THAT THE PAPER CLIPS WENT WITH THE MAGNET BECAUSE THEY HAVE MAGNETITE IN THEM,I NOTICED THAT THE PAPER CLIP WIT WITH THE MAGNET BECAUSE THEY HAVE MAGNETITEEN
9566,OKAY,OK
9567,THE ONE I PICKED WAS THE SALT BECAUSE IT'S BEST FOR EVAPORATING TO MAKE SALT CRYSTALS,THE WON I PICKED WAS THE SULT BECAUSE IT'S BEST FULL OF VAPIRATING TO MAKE SALT CRISTLES
9568,THAT MEANS WELL MAKING THE WATER NOT UM GO UM WELL IT'S JUST MAKING THE WATER DISAPPEAR TO MAKE THE SALT COME,THAT MEANS WELL MAKING THE WATER NOT UHM GO UHM WELL IT'S JUST MAKING THE WATER DISAPPEARE TO MAKE THE SALT COMB
9569,BECAUSE THEY HAVE DIFFERENT DENSITY STUFF,BECAUSE THEY HAVE DIFFERENT THE CITIES TUFF

9573,SOLUTION A IS A IS IS IS IS IS IS SALT YOU CAN FIGURE THAT OUT BY DRAINING IT AND SEEING WHAT IT IS,SULLUTION A IS A IS I I ISIS IS SAULT YOU CAN FICKI THAT OUT BY DRY TO GET AND SEINK WHAT IT IS
9574,UM IT'S ABOUT THE LIMITS ABOUT HOW MUCH YOU CAN HOLD STUFF,UHM IT'S ABOUT THE LIMITS ABOUT HOW MUCH YOU CAN HOLD STUFF
9575,I THINK THAT THEY'RE ADDING ENOUGH SALT TO MAKE THE WATER REACH THE LIMIT ABOUT HOW MUCH SALT IT CAN HOLD,I THINK THAT THEY ARE ADDING ENOUGH SALT CAN MAKE THE WATER REACH THE LIMIT ABOUT HOW MUCH SALT IT CAN HOLD
9576,UM THE WATER CAN HOLD FOUR SCOOPS OF CITRIC ACID BUT ONLY THREE SCOOPS OF EPSOM SALT,UHM THE WATER CAN HOLD FULL SKIPS OF SICRE ITED ASKET ASSAID BUT ONLY THREE S SRUPS OF EA SOME SOULT
9577,THEY'RE REACHING THEIR LIMITS OF HOW MUCH THEY CAN HOLD IN THE WATER,THEY ARE REACHING THEY ARE LIMINT SOME HOW MUCH THEY CAN HOLD IN THE WATER

9583,IT MAKES THE THINGS MORE CONTRASTED,W IT MAKES THE THINGS MORE CONTRAST
9584,I THINK THAT THE ONE ON THE RIGHT WILL WEIGH MORE THAN THE ONE ON THE LEFT,I THINK THAT THE ONE ON THE WRIGHT WILL WEAY MOLD HAN THE ONE ON THE LEF
9585,BY THEIR WEIGHT,BY THEIR WAIOT

9594,BECAUSE THE ONE ON THE RIGHT IS MORE CONTRASTED THAN THE ONE ON THE LEFT,BECAUSE THE ONE O THER RIGHTS IS MORE CONTRASTED THAN THE ONE ON THE LEFT
9595,THE GRAPE THING THE ONE TO THE LEFT IS MORE CONCENTRATED AND THE SALT WATER WATER ONES ARE,THE GREAT THING THE ONE TO THE LEFT IS MORE CONENTRATED AND THE SULT WANTER ONEE ASUCH
9596,I THINK THE ONE WITH THE MORE GRAPE POWDER WILL TASTE MORE LIKE GRAPE AND THE OTHER ONE WILL TASTE MORE LIKE WATER THAN GRAPE,I THINK THE ONE WITH THE MOLLE GREAT POUDER WILL TACE SMALLTE CRAPE AND THE OTHER ONE WILL TASE MORE LIKE WATER THAN GRAPE

9610,BECAUSE YOU DIDN'T ADD AS MUCH SOLUTE THAT YOU DID TO THE SOLVENT SO THEY'RE LESS THEY'RE MORE DILUTED THEY ARE DILUTED,BECAUSE YOU DIDN'T AD AS MUCH SOLLYOU THAT YOU DID TO THE SELVENT SO THEY 'RLESS THEY'RE MORE DELUDD THEY ARE DELUDE

9620,WE LEARNED ABOUT SATURATION,ATS WE LEARNED ABOUT STATUATION
9621,YOU CAN SAY THAT IT'S MORE CONTRASTED,OU CAN SAY THAT IT'S MORE CONTRASTED
9622,SO SOLUTION A IS MORE DENSE THAN SOLUTION B BECAUSE THE GRAM WENT TO THE BOTTOM AND THEN THE B WENT TO THE TOP,SO SALLUTION A IS MOREDANCE THEN SALLUTION BE BECAUSE THE GRAM WENT TO THE BOTTOM AND TH BE WENT TO THE TO
9623,IT JUST STAYS AT THE TOP,IT JUST STAYS AT THE D
9624,IT SAYS THAT THE BLUE IS TWELVE GRAMS WHEN THE GREEN IS TWO GRAMS SO IT HAS TEN MORE GRAMS THAN IT,IT SAYS THAT THE BLUE IS TWELVE GRAMS WHEN THE GREAN HAS TO GRAMS SO IT HAS TINMORE GRAS THAN
9625,BECAUSE THE THE HEAVIER ONE SUNK TO THE BOTTOM AND MIXED IN WITH THE LIGHTER ONE,BECAUSE THE THE HEAVIER ONE SUNK TO THE BOTTOM AND MIXED IN WITH THE LIGHTEL ONE
9626,ONE THE LESS DENSE ONE GOES STAYS TO THE TOP THE ONE THAT I'VE ALREADY DONE THAT THE ONE THAT'S MORE DENSE WILL,ONE THE LESTN ONE GOES STAYS TO THE TOP THE ONE THAT I'VE AREADY NELL THAT THE ONE THAT'S MORE DENCE WELL
9627,THEY ARE BEING SEPARATED CAUSE OF THEIR DENSITY,THEY ARE BEING SEPPERATED BECAUSE OF THEIR DENCITY
9628,I THINK THIS MEANS THAT SOLUTION A IS MORE DENSE THAN SOLUTION B,I THINK THIS MEANS THAT SULLUTION A IS MORE DENC THAN TO SULLUTION BE
9629,THEIR DENSITY CAME THE THEIR DENSITY BECAME THE SAME,THE DENCITY CAME THE THEIR DENCITY BECAME THE SAME
9630,THEY HAVE MORE OF THE SOLUTE IN THEM SO THEY ARE MORE CONTRASTED OR MORE DENSE,THEY HAVE MORE OF THE SOLU IN THEM SO THEY ALMOS CONTRASTED ALMOS DANCE
9631,WELL WHEN YOU MIX TWO SOLUTION SALT SOLUTIONS TOGETHER ONE THAT THE ONE THAT'S MORE DENSE WILL SINK TO THE BOTTOM AND THE ONE THAT'S LESS DENSE WILL GO TO THE TOP FLOAT,BUT WHEN YOU MIX TO SELLUSIO SOLT SELLUTIONS TOGETHER ONE THA THE ONE THAT'S MORE DENCE WILL SINK TO THE BOTTOM AND THE ONE THAT'S MOE LESS DENC WILL GO TO THE TOPFLOATE
9632,BAD,A

10090,IN THE MIDDLE OF THE RED COVERING THERE THIS THERE IS A SILVER COR SILVER CORD,IN THE MIDDLE OF THE RED COVERING THERE' TIS THERE'S A SIVPLE CSILVER CORD
10091,UM YOU NEED TWO CORDS AND A BATTERY,UHM YOU'D NEED TWO COARDS AND A BATTERY
10092,WELL THE THE CORD CONNECTS TO THE LIGHT BULB AND THE BATTERY IS PROVIDING LIGHT,WELL THE THE CORD CONNECTED TO THE LAYBOLD AND THE BATTERY IS A PRVIDING LIGHT
10093,SORRY,FURRY
10094,A METAL CORD CONNECTING TO WHERE THEY THE LIGHT IS PROVIDING,A MEDTAL CORD CONNECTING TO WEAR THEY THE LIGHT IST PERFIGHTING

10097,YES,YES
10098,BECAUSE THE TWO CORDS CONNECT FROM THE BATTERY'S ENERGY INTO THE LIGHT BULB THAT PROVIDES LIGHT,ECAUSE THE TWO CORSE CONECT FROM THE BATTERYE'S ENERGY INTO THE LIBL THAT PRVI LIGHT
10099,THE TWO CORDS ARE CONNECTING TO THE BATTERY AND THE BATTERY TH I MEAN THE WIRES ARE CONNECTING TO THE LIGHT BULB AND MAKING LIGHT,THE TWO COARTS ARE CONECTING TO THE BATTERY AND THE BATTERY THAT YOU MEAN THE WIERES ARE CONECTING TO THE LIGHEBULB AND MAKING LIGHT
10100,THIS CIRCUIT IS GOING TO CONNECT TO THE WIRES,THIS CIRCUT IS GOING TO CONECT TO THE WIRES I THINK
10101,THE TWO CORDS ARE CONNECTING TO THE METAL RODS AND MAKING A ELECTRICITY I MEAN ELECTRICITY,THE TWO CARSERETING TO THE MEDDAL BRODS AND MAKING A ELECTRISITY I MEAN ELECTRISITY
10102,UM THEY ARE FLOWING FROM FROM EACH LIGHT BULB AND GIVING MORE ELECTRICITY AND EQUAL POWER TO EACH LIGHT BULB,UHM THEY ARE FLOWING FR FROM EACH LAPUL AND GIVING MORE LECTRISITY AND EQUAL POWER TO EACH LAPOL
10103,WE HAVE BEEN MAKING CLOSED CIRCUITS OPEN CIRCUITS AND PARALLEL CIRCUITS,WE HAVE BEEN MAKING CLOSE CURCUETS ZERY CIRCUETS OPEN CIRCUTS AND PARLLE CUIRCUTS
10104,THE BOTH OF THE CIRCUITS ARE FLOWING PLUS TO MINUS BUT UM FROM THE LEFT SIDE IT LOOKS A LITTLE DIFFERENT,THE BOTH OFTHE CUIRCUTES ARE FLOWING PLUS DA MIN US BUT UHM FROM THE LEFT SIDE IT LOOKS A LITTLE DIFFERENT
10105,THEY UM WHAT'S SPECIAL ABOUT THE CIRCUITS ARE THEY MAKE EQUAL POWER AND THEY ARE CLOSED INSTEAD OF OPEN,THEY UHM WHAT'S SPECIAL ABOUT THE CURCUTS ARE THEY MAKE EAQUAL POWER AND THEY ARE CLOSED INSTEAD OF OPEN
10106,THAT THE PO THE ELECTRICITY IS FLOWING THROUGH EACH LIGHT BULB UM AND MAKING IT EQUAL LIGHT FOR EACH LIGHT BULB,THAT THE P THE ELECTRISITY IS FLOWING THRE EACH LAPAL UHM AND MAKING AT EQUAL LIGHT FOR EACH LAPALB
10107,I THINK THAT UM THEIR THE D CELL IS GETTING THEIR GIVING THE POWER TO THE TWO LIGHT BULBS,I THINK THAT UHM THERE THE DSAL IS GETTING THER GIVING THE POER TO THE TWO LYGHBULBS
10108,UM I COULD SHOW WITH MY FINGER OF HOW I SAW IT UM IT WAS A SERIES CIRCUIT AND WHY THE OTHER ONE IS A PARALLEL,UHM I COULD SHOW WITH MY FINGER OF HOW I THOUGHT UHM IT WAS A SERY CIRCET AND WHY THE OTHE ONE IS A PARRELLEL
10109,GOOD,GOOD
10110,THEN THE OTHER LIGHT BULB WOULD GET BRIGHTER IF IT WAS A SERIES NO A PARALLEL BUT IF IT WAS A SERIES BOTH OF THEM WOULD GO OUT,THEN THE OTHER LIGHT BOB WOULD GET BRIGHTER IF OS A SERIE NO A PARILE BUT IF IT WAS A SERIES BOTH OF THEM WOULD GO OUT
10111,WELL IT ALSO STARTS FROM COMING OUT THE NEGATIVE AND THEN IT GOES THROUGH THE POSITIVE AGAIN AND THEN COMES OUT THE NEGATIVE ON BOTH ENDS IT MAKES THE CIRCUIT,WELL IT ALSO STARTS FROM COMING OUT THE NEGGIVE AND THEN IT GOES THROUGH THE POSITI BEGIN AND THENT COMES OUT THE NAGGETIVE ON BOTH AND IT MAKES THE CIRCUET
10112,IF IF NOT A PARALLEL CIRCUIT THAT MEANS THAT THERE IS ONLY ONE CIRCUIT AND IT HAS TO BE AN OP CLOSED CIRCUIT,IF IT'S NOT A PARELLELL CIRCUTE THAT MEANS THAT THERE IS ONLY ONE CIRCUET AND IT HAS TO BE IN H CLOSE CIRCUET
10113,THAT UM IF THE OP THE CIRCUIT WAS OPEN THEN THE LIGHT WOULDN'T WORK,THAT UHM IF THE OP THE CIRCET WAS OPENE THEN THE LIGHT WOULDN'T WORK
10114,BECAUSE IF THERE'S MORE OF WIRES IT WILL MAKE THE LIGHT STRONGER,BECAUSE IF THERE'S MORE WIRES IT WILL MAKE THE LIGHT STRONGER
10115,WE HAVE BEEN TRYING TO LIGHT TWO PARALLEL CIRCUITS,WE HAVE BEEN TRYING TO LIGHT TO PARELE CIRCETS
10116,IT'S A CLOSED CIRCUIT AND THE THE ENERGY IS GOING THROUGH THE LIGHT BULBS AND INTO THE BATTERY,IT'S A CLOSE SEARCET AND THETHE ENERGY IS GOING THROUGH THE LIGPEBULBS IN INTO THE BATTERY

11207,I HAVE TWO,I HAVE TO
11208,THERE'S ONLY ONE WIRE ON THE BATTERY AND TWO WIRES WHERE THE LIGHT BULB IS,THRE WAS ONLY ONE AWAR AND BATTER THAN TIS WARE THE NI BULEST
11209,YES TWO LIGHT BULBS AND ONE BATTERY,THERES TWO I PULLBD THOM ONE BETTER
11210,CAN I SEE THE OTHER ONE AGAIN,CAN I SEE HE OTHE ONE AGAIN
11211,HMM IT'S A LITTLE DIFFERENT,IT'S A LITTLE DIFFERENT
11212,LIGHT BULB,I
11213,I TOOK THE METER STICK AND I PRETENDED THAT THERE IS TWO AND THEN SO THEN IT LOOKED LIKE IT WOULD BE T ABOUT TWO METER STICKS LONG,I TOOK THE MEATER STICK AND I PRETENDED THAT THERE WERE TWO AND THEN SUN LOOK LIKE IT WOULD BE ABOUT TWO MEATER STICKS LONGER
11214,WE MEASURED IT WITH UM WITH UM METER STICKS AND DECIMETERS AND UM CENTIMETERS,WE MEASURED IT WITH UHM WITH UHM MEATOR STICKS AND DESA MEUTERS AND UHM SAID THE MEATORS
11215,MMM YOU MEASURE YOURSELF AND THEN I CAN'T REMEMBER,YOU MEASURE YOURSELF AND THEN I CAN'T REMEMBER
11216,UM I'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT MEASUREMENTS,E DOCTOR I TEL OUR TAT WAT' YU N UHM I'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT MEASURMENT
11217,ONE METER LONG,ONE MEETER LONG
11218,UM I'VE BEEN DOING LIKE I'VE BEEN MEASURING OUR BODY AND DIFFERENT PARTS OF IT,UHM I'VE BEEN DOING LIKE I'VE BEEN MEASURING OUR BODY IN DIFFERENT PARTS OF IT
11219,WELL IT WAS FUN CAUSE WE GOT TO LEARN LIKE HOW BE HOW LONG OUR ARM SPAN IS AND HOW TALL WE ARE AND LIKE HOW LONG OUR FOOT IS AND IT WAS REALLY FUN,WELL IT WAS FUN BECAUSE WE GOT LEARNING LIKE HOW BIT HOW LONG OUR ARMS SPANDS AND HOW TALL WE ARE AND LIKE HO LONG OUR FOOT IS MOOALY FUN
11220,TWO METERS LONG,TWO METERS LONG
11221,HE'S MEASURING HOW LONG HE IS,HIS MEASURING HOW LONG HE IS
11222,YOU TR USE YOUR MATH SKILLS YOU TRY TO GUESS WHAT WHAT HOW MUCH SOMETHING IS OR WHAT THE ANSWER IS,YOU CHOU USE YOUR MOUSCALES YOU TRY TO GUESS WHAT WHT HOW MUCH SOMETHING ANSWERE WHAT THE ANSWER IS
11223,YES,YES
11224,YES,YES
11225,A DECIMETER A CENTIMETER AND A METER,A DESMEATOR A SENTMETER IND A METER
11226,I MEAN YOU TAKE THE METER STICK AND YOU PUT IT ON THE END OF THE THE METER STICK ON THE FLOOR AND THEN YOU PUT AND THEN YOU KEEP MEASURING AND THEN YOU KNOW HOW MUCH HE IS,I MEAN YOU TAKE THE MEATOR STICK AND YOU PUT IT ON THE END O THE MEUSTRIC ON THE FLOOR AND THEN YOU PUT AND THEN YOU KEEP MEASURING  LINAN YOU KNOW HOW MUCH HE IS
11227,FINGER,FINGER
11228,BECAUSE THE SPACE THAT DOESN'T HAVE THE METER STICK IT'LL THAT PART LOOKS LIKE THE SAME AMOUNT THAT THE METER STICK IS,BECAUSE THE SPACE THAT DOESN'T HAVE THE MEATER STICK ILLIN THAT PART LOOKS LIKE THE SAME AMOUNT THAT THE METER STICK IS
11229,YOU'RE MEASURING HIS FINGER SO IT'S ELEVEN CENTIMETERS,YOU'RE MEASURING HIS FINGERS SO IT'S ELEVEN SENTTMETERS
11230,THAT I WAS CORRECT,THAT I WAS CORECT
11231,HOW LONG HE IS,HOW LONG HE IS
11232,UM I THINK LEARNING ABOUT HOW YOU HOW LONG SOMETHING IS OR YEAH,UHM I THINK LEARNING ABOUT HOW YOU HOW LONG SOMETHING IS  YEAH
11233,YOU PUT THE END OF THE METER STICK ON THE FLOOR AND THEN YOU COUNT EACH CENTIMETER AND THEN YOU BRING THE METER STICK UP AND THEN YOU KNOW HOW MUCH IT IS,YOU PUT THE END OF THE MEATER STICK ON THE FLOOR AND THEN YOU COUN'T EACH SENT A METOR AND THEN YOU BRING THE MUTOSTICK UP AND THEN YOU KNOW HOW MUCH HE IS
11234,CENTIMETERS ARE ABOUT HOW THAT'S ANOTHER TOOL YOU CAN USE TO MEASURE SOMETHING,SENTA MEANTERS AR ABOUT HOW THAT'S ANOTHER CHILL YOU CAN USE TO MEASURE SOMETHING
11235,I DON'T KNOW,I DON'T KNOW
11236,SO WE KNOW HOW HOT OR COLD SOMETHING IS,SO WE KNOW HOW HAT IR COLD SOMETHING IS
11237,COULD MEAS THEY'RE MEASURING HOW HOT OR COLD IT IS,YOUR MEAS URE MEASURING HOW HOT OR COLD IT IS
11238,WE'VE BEEN DOING CAPACITY AND THE TEMPERATURE OF WATER,WEVBEN DO IN CAPASSITY AND THE TEMPERATURE OF WATER
11239,I THINK IT'S SIXTY DEGREE CELSIUS BECAUSE FIFTY DEGREE CELSIUS PLUS TEN DEGREE CELSIUS EQUALS SIXTY DEGREE CELSIUS,I THINK IT'S SIX DUTY SALCIOS BECAUSE FIFTY DAGREE SALCIAS PLUZS TENT AGREE SALCIUS EQUAL T SIXTY DAGREE SALCIOUS
11240,I THINK THAT IF ONE CUP IS FIFTY DEGREE CELSIUS AND ONE IS TEN DEGREE CELSIUS THEY'LL GO TOGETHER AND THEN IT'LL BE SIXTY DEGREE CELSIUS,I THINK THAT IF ONE CUP IS FIFTY DEGREE SSCIUS AND ONE IS TEN DEGREE SOCIUS WILL GO TOGETHER AND THEN IT WIL BE SIXTY DEAGRE SECIUS
11241,BECAUSE MAYBE THE WATERS THE TEMPERATURES MAYBE BECAUSE THEY WERE DIFFERENT THEY ENDED UP BEING A DIFFERENT THINGS AND DIFFERENT TEMPERATURE INSTEAD OF SIXTY,BECAUSE MAYBE THE WATER THE TEMPERATURESRE BECAUSE THEY WERE DIFFERENT THEY ENDED UP BEING A DIFFERENT THINGS AN  DIFFERENT TEMPERATURE INSTEAD OF SIXTY
11242,THAT SOMETIMES WE MEASURE STUFF IT COULD BE A DIFFERENT ANSWER THAN WHAT YOU REALLY THINK,THAT SOMETIMES WHEN YOU MEASURED STUFF IT CALN BE A DIFFERENT ANCH TAN WHAT YOU REALLY THINK
11243,WE TOOK A THERMOMETER AND WE PUT IN THE WATER AND WE MEASURED IT WITH UM CELSIUS,WE TOOK US THERMOMATUR AND WE PUT IN THE WATER AND WE MEASURED IT WITH UHM SELCIYAS

11664,GET THEIR ENERGY FROM EATING OTHER THEY CAN'T THEY CAN'T EAT THEMSELVES BECAUSE AND THEY CAN'T MAKE THEIR OWN FOOD SO THAT'S WHY THEY HAVE TO EAT THE OTHER ANIMALS AND THEY EAT PRODUCERS,L'S GET THEIR ENERGY FROM EATING OTHER THEY CAN'T THEY CAN'T EAT THEMSELVES BECAUSE AND THEY CAN'T MAKE THEIR OWN FOOD SO THAT'S WHY THEY HAVE TO  OTHER ANIMALS AND TE PRODUCEERS
11665,IT'S NOT A PRODUCER OR A CONSUMER IT'S A DECOMPOSER,IT'S NOT A PRODUSER OR CONCSUMER ITS A DECOMPOSUR
11666,THEY EAT IT ALL AND THEN THEY TURN IT INTO SOIL THAT'S WHY THEY ARE A DECOMPOSER,THEY EAT IT ALL AND THEN THEY TURN IT INTO SOIL THAT'S WHY THEY ARE DECOMPOSUR

11668,WHAT IT'S ALL ABOUT BECAUSE IT BREAKS DOWN HERE OR DIGGING UM ALL ORGANISTS OF MATTER,WHAT IT'S ALL ABOUT BECAUSE IT BREAKS DOWN HERE OR DIGING DICCARA UHM ALL ORGONISTS OF MATTER
11669,NO THEY ARE NOT,KNOW THEY ARE NOT
11670,I THINK WHY IT'S SO IMPORTANT IS JUST BECAUSE UM THEY RETURN NUTRIENTS AND WE NUTRIENTS IN OUR BODY,I THINK WHY IT'S SO IMPORTANT IT'S JUST BECAUSE UHM THEY RETURN NEW TRAINS AND WE NEW TRENS IN OUR BODY

11673,I THINK WHAT IT MEANS TO BE A DECOMPOSER THAT IT MEANS IT EATS IT AND THEN IT UM RETURNS NUTRIENTS TO THE EARTH,I THINK WHA BE MEANS TO BE A DE COMPOSURE THAT IT MEANS IT EATS IT AND THEN IT T UHM RETURNES NEW TRNS TO THE EARTH
11674,BECAUSE THEY BREAK DOWN BONES AND ALSO THEY CAN TURN IT INTO SOMETHING NEW LIKE SOIL JUST LIKE WORMS,BECAUSE THEY BREAKE DOWN BONES AND ALSO THEY CANT TURN IT INTO SOMETHING YOU LIKE SOIL JUST LIKE WORMS
11675,THE DECOMPOSERS ARE MUSHROOM OR FUNGI AND BACTERIA,THE DEEP COMPOSEURS ARE MUSHROOME OR FUNGGY IN BACKTEREIA
11676,I BEEN LEARNING ABOUT THE FOOD WEB ALSO PRODUCERS DECOMPOSERS AND CONSUMERS,I'E BEEN LEARNING ABOUT THE FOOD WE ALSO PRODUCEURSTY COMPOSERS AND CONCUMERS
11677,IT'S A DECOMPOSER IT EATS DECAYING AND DECAYING MATTER AND RETURNS NUTRIENTS TO THE EARTH,IT'S A DECOMPOSUR IT EAS DICCAN AND DICAIN MATTER AND RETURNS NEW TRANSE TO THE EARTH
11678,I THINK WHAT THE LUNGS DO IS THAT UM THEY GIVE US OXYGEN AND THE MAIN ORGAN FOR BREATHING IS IN HUMANS AND SO THAT'S WHAT I THINK ABOUT LUNG,I THINK WHAT THE LUNGS DO IS THAT UHM THEY GIVE US OXYGEN AND THE MAIN ORGON FOR BREATHING IS IN HUMANS AND SO THAT'S WHAT I THINK ABOUT LUNG
11679,THEY UH BRING IN OXYGEN WITH EXCHANGE OF THE CARBON DIOXIDE,A  BRING IN OXIJIN WITH EXCHANGE OF THE CARM DO SID
11680,WHAT THE LUNGS DO IS THAT ONCE WE BREATHE IN IT GETS KIND OF FATTER AND BIGGER AND ONCE WE GO OUT IT GETS SMALLER,WHAT THE LUNGS DO IS THAT ONCE WE BREATHE IN IT GETS KIND OF FATTER AND BIGGER AND ONCE WE BREATHE OUT IT GOES SMALLER
11681,THAT UM IT'S GOING THROUGH AND THROUGH LIKE I SEE LIKE SOME CIRCULAR THINGS AND IT'S GOING BY FROM THE HEART AND THE CAPILLARY AND OTHERS,THAT UHM IT'S GOING THROUGH AND THHROUGH LIKE A SEE LIKE SOME CIRCULAR THINGS AND IT'S GOING BY THE FROM THE HART AND THE CAT  PEARLY AND OTHER
11682,HOW THEY INHALE AND EXHALE IS INHALE IS LIKE ONCE YOU BREATHE IN FROM THE NOSE WHICH IS THE FILTER AND THEN EXHALE IS WHEN YOU BREATHE OUT,HOW THEY IN HAL AN EX AL IS IN HAIL IS LIKE ONCE YOU BREATHE IN FROM THE NOSE WHICH IS THE FILTER AND THEN EX HAILES WHEN YOU BREATH OUT
11683,I THINK WHAT IT'S ALL ABOUT IS THAT IT'S SHOWING HOW UM WHERE AIR GOES IN AND CARBON DIOXIDE GOES OUT IN AND OUT OF YOUR MOUTH OR YOUR NOSE,I THINK WHAT IT'S ALL ABOUT IS THAT IT'S SHOWING HOW UHM WHERE AIR GOES IN AN CARM DONS I GOES OUT IN AN OUT OF YOUR MOUTH OR YOUR NOSE
11684,WHAT THE RESPIRATORY SYSTEM DOES IS LIKE IT HELPS YOU BREATHE LIKE WHEN IT IT GOES IN AND OUT OF YOUR LUNGS WHEN OXYGEN GOES IN AND CARBON DIOXIDE GOES OUT,WHAT THE RESPERITORI SISTOM DOES IS LIKE IT HELPS YOU BREATHH LIKE WHEN IT IT GOES IN AN OUT OF YOUR LUNGS WHEN OXYGEN GOES IN IN CARM DOXSIDE GOES OUT
11685,I SEE LITTLE CIRCLES LIKE IT'S GETTING PASSED THROUGH LIKE A SYSTEM LIKE THE CARBON DIOXIDE IS GOING OUT AND OXYGEN IS GOING IN,I SEE LITTLE CIRCLES LIKE IT'S GETTING PAST THROOUGH LIKE A SISTOM LIKE THE CARB DIOCCIE IS GOING OUT AN OX I JENIS GOING IN
11686,DOING GOOD,DOING GOOD
11687,THEY'RE RESPONSIBLE FOR I THINK WHEN CARBON OXYGEN GOES IN AND THEY'RE RESPONSIBLE FOR CARBON DIOXIDE TO GO OUT,THEY'R RESPONSIBLE FOR I THINK WHEN CARM OXYGEN GOES IN AND THE'R RESPONSIBLE FOR COM DIY OXIT TO GO OUT
11688,WHAT THE EXCHANGE OF GASES IS ALL ABOUT IS WE SURVIVE WITH OXYGEN WE CAN'T SURVIVE WITH CARBON DIOXIDE CAUSE THAT'S KIND OF A POISON OXYGEN TO US,WHAT THE EXCHANGE OF GESSES ALL ABOUT IS WE SAGT SURVIVE WITH OXYGEN WE CAN'T SURVIVE WITH CARBN DY OX CAUSE THAT'S KIND OF  POIZON OXYGEN TO US
11689,FIRST OF ALL WE NEED TO SURVIVE SECOND OF ALL UM IT'S OUR ONLY WAY OF LIFE TO BREATHE,FIRST OF ALL WE NEED TO SURVIVE SECOND A BALL UHM IT'S OUR ONLY WAY FOE LIFE TO BREATH
11690,THAT WOULD PROBABLY BE OXYGEN,THAT WOULD PROBABLY BE OXYGEN
11691,THE GAS EXCHANGE IS FROM THOSE ALVEOLI AND UM THAT'S WHERE UM WHERE THE OXYGEN GOES IN AND THE CARBON DIOXIDE GOES OUT,A GASTICXCHANGEMENT IS FROM THOSE ABVLY AND UHM THAT'S WHERE UHM WHERE THE UH OXYGEN GOES IN IND THE CARBAN DI OXIDE GOES OUT
11692,I THINK IT IS E FOR LUNGS,I THINK IT IS EA FOR LUNGS
11693,I THINK THEIR BEHAVIOR IS SAFETY BECAUSE THEY DON'T WANT TO BE EATEN WHEN THEY ARE FLYING HIGH IN THE AIR,I THINK THEYRE BEHAVIORE IS SAFTY BECAUSE THEY DON'T WANT TO BE EATENTHEIR FLANK HIGH IN THE AI
11694,I'M DOING GOOD,I'M DOING GOO

11712,THAT THE SKUNKS TAIL IS ONE OF THE ADAPTATIONS BECAUSE IT SHOOTS THE SMELL OUT OF IT,JACK THE SUNS TAIL IS ONE OF THE ADIGTATIONS BCAUSE IT SHUTS UHM THE SMELL OUT OF
11713,THAT THEY ALL HAVE DIFFERENT REACTIONS ON DIFFERENT THINGS,THAT THEY UHM ALL HAVE DIFFERENT REACTIONS ON DIFFERENT THINGS
11714,BECAUSE USUALLY ANIMALS ARE SCARED OF BRIGHT COLORS OR PREDATORS ARE SCARED OF BRIGHT COLORS,CAUSE USUALLY UHM ANIMALS ARE SCARED O BRITE COLORS OR PREDITORS OR SCARED TO BRITE COLORS
11715,LIKE IT'S KIND OF LIKE THE SAME COLOR AS THE GROUND AND ALSO THE TURTLE CAN ACTUALLY HIDE IN ITS SHELL AND ALSO IT CAN COME IN SO NO PREDATORS CAN GET IT,LIKE IT'S CANT LIKE THE SAME COLOR AS THE GROUND AND ALSO THE TURTLE CAN ACTUALLY HIDE IN IT SHELL AND ALSO WIT CAN COME AND SO P NO PREORS CAN GET IT
11716,THAT MEANS WHAT THE REACTION PART IS I WOULD PROBABLY JUST GO AWAY FROM IT,THAT MEANS UHM WHAT THE RACTION PART IS I WOULD PROBABLY JUST GO AWAY FROM IT
11717,I THINK IT'S A MIGRATION BEHAVIOR BECAUSE THE BLACK THING IS STUCK ON THE HUMAN'S KNEE,I THINK IT'S AF MY GRATIONAL BEHAVIOR BECAUSE UHM THE BLACK THING IS STUCK ON THE HUMANS NE

11724,I SEE THE WATER I SEE THE ATMOSPHERE WHICH IS THE SKY I SEE THE MOUNTAINS I SEE SOME TREES AND SOME HOUSES,I SEE THE WATER I SEE THE ATMISFER WHICH IS THE SKY I SEE THE MOUNTAINS I SEE SOME TREES AND SOME HOUSES
11725,I THINK THE BIOSPHERE IS MADE OUT OF UM PROBABLY TREES AND HUMANS AND ANIMALS PROBABLY JUST TREES PLANTS AND ANIMALS,I THINK THE BILS FEAR IS MADE OUT OF UHM PROBABLY TREES AND HUMANS AND ANIMALS PROBABLY JUST TREESE PLANTS AND ANIMALS THAT'S WHAT I THINK
11726,THE BIOSPHERE IS PROBABLY ALL ABOUT LIFE LIKE TREES PLANTS AND US LIKE HUMANS,THE BIYER'S FEAR IS PROBABLY ALL ABOUT LIFE LIKE TREES PLANTS AND US LIKE HUMANS
11727,GOOD,A
11728,I THINK THEY'RE JUST TRYING TO SURVIVE NOT LIKE TO GET EATEN BUT PROBABLY THE MOST DANGEROUS ONES ARE A SNAKE A RED TAILED HAWK,I THINK THEY'RE JUST TRYING TO SURVI'VE NOT LIKED TO GET EATEN BUT PROBABLY THE MOST DANGEROUS ONES ARE  SNAKE IN A RED TAILED HAWK
11729,WELL PROBABLY MOST ANIMALS GO FOR PROBABLY BACTERIA MUSHROOMS AND UM THE OTHERS JUST GO FOR LIKE PLANTS,OH PROBABLY MOST ANIMALS GO FOR PROBABLY BACTEREIA MUSHROOMS AND UHM THE OTHERS JUST GO FOR LIKE PLANTS

11732,I THINK IT REPRESENTS THE CLIMATE OR WEATHER OR LIKE THE TEMPERATURE,I THINK IT REPPRESENTS THE CLIMATE OR WHEATHER OR LIKE THE TEMPERATURE
11733,WHAT IT NEEDS IS TO SURVIVE IS PROBABLY SOIL WATER AIR AND SUNSHINE,WHAT IT NEEDS IS TO SURVIVE IS PROBABLY SOIL WATER AIR AND SUNSH
11734,THEY DON'T GET THEIR OWN FOOD THEY MAKE THEIR OWN FOOD CAUSE THEY'RE A PRODUCER AND IT MAKES IT'S OWN FOOD THROUGH PHOTOSYNTHESIS,THEY DON'T GET THEIR OWN FOOD THEY MAKE THEIR OWN FOOD CAUSE THEYRE A PRODUCR AND IT MAKES ITS OWN FOOD THRUGH PO ASEMPTENCES
11735,THEY MAKE IT THROUGH THEIR OWN PHOTOSYNTHESIS,THEY MAKE IT THROUGH THEIR OWN POTOA SIMPECES
11736,IT KIND OF LOOKS GREEN BUT IT IT HAS SUNSHINE AND AIR BUT NO WATER SO THAT'S WHY IT'S KIND OF LIKE BENDING,IT KIND OF LOOKS GREEAN BUT UHM IT IT HAS SUNSHINE T AIR BUT NO WATER SO THAT'S WHY IT'S KIND OF LIKE BENDING
11737,I THINK ALL THOSE CELLS LIKE COMBINE TO MAKE ONE WHOLE LIKE TINY GRAIN OF SAND OF YEAST,I THINK ALL THOSE SELVES LIKE COMBINED TO MAKE ONE HOLE L CTINY GRAIN OF SAND AF EA
11738,IT'S LIKE WHAT EATS WHAT AND WHAT EATS THEM,IT'S LIKE WHAT EATS WHAT AND WHAT EATS THE
11739,WHEN WATER SUNSHINE AND AIR AND LIKE ALL THOSE COMBINE TOGETHER THE ROOTS GO DOWN INTO THE DIRT AND THEN WHEN WHICH COMES OUT IS LIKE A PLANT,WHEN WATER SUNSHINE AND AIR R LIKE ALL THOSE COMBINE TOGETHER THE ROOTS GO DOWN INTO THE DIRT AND THEN WHEN UHM WHICH COMES OUT IS LIKE A PLA

11741,DOING GOOD,DOING GO
11742,THEY DO NOT BECAUSE BECAUSE WHEN IT RAINS IN THE SPRING IT GETS WATER AND THEN SUNSHINE AND THEN IT GETS AIR WHEN IT BLOWS,THEY DO NOT BECAUSE UHM UH BECAUSE WHEN IT RAINS IN THE SPRING IT GETS WATER AND THEN SUN SHINE AND THEN IT GETS AIR WHEN IT BLOWS
11743,I THINK PLANTS I READ A BOOK ABOUT THIS AND IT PROBABLY NEEDS CARBON DIOXIDE WHICH IS KIND OF IT'S AIR,I THINK PLANTS IV READ A BOOK ABOUT THIS AND IT PROABLY NEEDS CARM DYOC SIDE WHICH IS KIND OF ITSA
11744,ACTUALLY NO BECAUSE WHEN I DID MY EXPERIMENT IN THE BAG WE DIDN'T USE ANY WATER AND IT'S AND IT'S STILL GROWING ON ITS OWN,ACTUALLY KNOW BECAUSE UHM WHEN I DID MY EXPERIMENT UHM IN THE BAG WE DIDN'T USE ANY WATER AND IT'S IN IT'S STILL GROWING ON ITS OHN
11745,YES THEY DO NEED IT,ES THEY DO NEED IT
11746,YES IT DOES,YES IT DOES
11747,IT'S BECAUSE THEY WERE ALL SICKLY AND NOT HEALTHY,IT'S BECAUSE THEY WEREL SICKLY AND NOT HEALTTHY
11748,IT WOULDN'T BE A PROBLEM BECAUSE LIKE I JUST SAID IT GOES THROUGH IT'S OWN PHOTOSYNTHESIS WHICH IT MAKES IT'S OWN FOOD IT CAN'T EAT ANYTHING,IT WOULDN'T BE A PROBLEM BECAUSE UHM LIKE A JUST SAID I'LL IT GOES THROUGH ITS OWN BOTA SIMPISES WHICH IT MAKES ITS OWN FOOD THEY CAN'T EAT ANYTH
11749,WHEN WE PUT THE PLANTS IN THE BAG IT HAD LIKE A TON OF AIR OR CARBON DIOXIDE IN IT AND THAT'S WHY IT NEEDS TO SURVIVE,WHEN WE PUT THE PLANTS IN THA BAG UHM IT HAD LIKE A TON OF AIR CURB IN DIOXSIDED IDNT IT AND THAT'S WHY IT NEEDS TO SURVIVE
11750,IT HAS TWO OUT OF THREE BUT NOT THREE OUT OF THREE BECAUSE THEY IT NEEDS WATER AIR AND SUNSHINE IT CAN NOT BE WATER AIR AND NO SUNSHINE,IT HAS TWO OUT OF THREE BUT NOT THREE OUT OF THREE BECAUSE UHM TH IT NEEDS WATER AIR AND SUNSHINE IT CANNOT BE WATER AIR AND NO SUNSH
11751,I THINK IT'S TRYING TO MAKE SOME KIND OF SIGNAL OR SOMETHING,I THINK IT'S TRYING TO MAKE SOME KIND OF SIGNAL OR SOMETTHING
11752,BECAUSE IT CAN'T BREATHE ANY CARBON DIOXIDE AND IT'S NOT BREATHING OUT ANY OXYGEN,BECAUSE UHM IT CAN'T BREATHE ANY CARMINDIOXSIDE AND IT'S NOT BREATHING OUT ANY OXYGEN
11753,I THINK IT'S KIND OF LIKE PLANTS LIKE THEY NEED SUNSHINE AIR AND WATER,I THINK IT'S KIND LIKE PLANTS LIKE THE UHM NEED SUNSHINE AIR IN WATER
11754,YES IT WOULD BE MISSING THREE THINGS SUN WATER AND AIR,YUES IT WOULD BE MISSING THREE THINGS SUN WATER AND AIR
11755,HOW IT RELATES TO ME IS LIKE IT GOES THROUGH IT'S OWN PHOTOSYNTHESIS IT NEEDS SUNSHINE WATER AND AIR FOR IT TO GROW,HOW IT RELATS TO ME IS LIKE UHM IT GOES THROUGH ITS OAT BONA BOAT OF SCAMPENCES AND NEEDS SUNSHINE WATER AN AIR FOR IT TO GROW
11756,WHERE FOOD WEBS START WILL PROBABLY BE AT THE PRODUCERS BECAUSE PROBABLY MOST CONSUMERS EAT THOSE PRODUCERS,WHERE FOOD WEPS START WILL PROBABLY BE AT THE PRODUCERS BECAUSE PROABLY MOST CONCUMERS EAT THOSE PRODUCERS
11757,THEY JUST STAY IN ONE PLACE THEY DON'T MOVE BESIDES THEY MAKE THEIR OWN FOOD THROUGH PHOTOSYNTHESIS WITH THE SUN CARBON DIOXIDE AND WATER,JUSTSTAY IN WONE PLACE THEY DON'T MOVE BESIDES  THEY MAKE THER OWN FOOD THROUGH POTOA CENTENCSES WITH UHM THE SUN COME CARPINT DI OXFIDE AND W
11758,THINK WHAT IT'S TRYING TO SHOW IS THAT SUNSHINE REFLECTS OFF THE PLANT SO IT CAN,I THINK WHAT IS TRYING TO SHOW IS THAT SUNSHINE REFLECTS OFF THE PLAN SO IT CAN
11759,BECAUSE GRASS AND THE PINE CONE ON THE TREE ARE PRODUCERS AND THE PLANTS ARE PRODUCERS THEY MAKE THEIR OWN FOOD WHICH THE CONSUMERS EAT,BECAUSE UHM GRASS I IN THE PINE CONE ON THE TREE ARE PRODUCERS AND THE PLANTS ARE PREDUCERS THEY MAKE THEIR OWN FOOD WHICH UHM THE CONCUMERS EAT
11760,YES THEY DO NEED IT BECAUSE IT'S KIND OF LIKE WHAT THEY NEED TO BREATHE,JESS THEY DO NEEDT BECAUSE IT'S KINDOF LIKE WHAT THEY NEED TO BREA
11761,WHAT I JUST REALLY THINK IS JUST WHAT EATS WHAT EATS THE PRODUCERS CONSUMERS AND THE DECOMPOSERS,WHAT I JUST REALLY THINK IS JUST WHAT EATS WHAT AND WHAT EATSTHE PRODUCERS CONSUMERS AND THE DECOMPOSERS
11762,IT'S BECAUSE IT DOESN'T HAVE ANY WATER,IT'S BECAUSE IT DOESN'T HAVE ANY WATER
11763,I THINK LIGHT WHEN IT REFLECTS SO IT HELPS IT GROW I THINK THE WATER WHEN YOU POUR IT SO IT STAYS HEALTHY AND THE CARBON DIOXIDE WHICH IT BREATHES IN AND OXYGEN IT BREATHES,I THINK LIGHT WHEN IT REFLECTS SO IT HELPS IT GROW I THINK THE WATER UHM WHEN YOU POR IT SO IT STAYES HEALTHY AND THE COWAR BINDHOCKS I WHICH IT BREAZES IN AN OXYGEN IT BREATHE
11764,I THINK THEY DO BECAUSE SOME ANIMALS EAT THEM AND THAT WILL PROTECT THEM FROM ANIMALS,I THINK THEY DO BECAUSE UHM SOME ANIMALS EAT THEM AND THAT WILL PROTECT THEM FROM ANIMALS
11765,I THINK WHY IS BECAUSE THERE'S NO WIND AND THERE'S JUST SUNSHINE AND WATER BUT IT HAS TO BE COMPLETE WITH WATER AIR AND SUNSHINE FOR IT TO GROW,I THINK WHY ITS BECAUSE UHM THERE'S NO WIND AND THERE'S JUST SUNSHINE IN WATER BUT IT HAS TO BE COMPLET WITH WATER AIR AND SUNSHINE FOR IT TO GROW
11766,IT HAS WATER SUNSHINE BUT NO AIR,IT HAS WATER SUNSHINE BUT NO AI
11767,THE SUN,THE SUN
11768,NO THEY DO NOT NEED FOOD BECAUSE THEY THEY HAVE THEY HAVE THEIR OWN PHOTOSYNTHESIS WHICH THEY MAKE THEIR OWN FOOD,KNOW THEY DO NOT NEED FOOD BECAUSE UHM THEY THEY HAVE THEY HAVE THEIR OWN POTA SUBENCES WHICH THEY MAKE THEIR OWN FOO
11769,LIKE SOME PEOPLE SAY SO IT DOESN'T DAMAGE IT,LIKE SOME PEOPLE SAY UHM SOE A DOESN'T DAMAG
11770,SOMETIMES WHEN CONSUMERS ARE EATING THEM THEY'LL HAVE TO PUT FERTILIZER AROUND IT SO THE ANIMALS CAN'T EAT CAUSE IF THEY EAT IT IT'LL KIND OF BE LIKE A GROSS TASTE,SOMETIMES WHEN CONCUMERS ARE EATING THEM THEY'LL HAVE TO PUT FURTALLIZER AROUND IT SO THE ANIMALS CAN'T EAT IT CAUSE IF THEY EAT IT CAN'T BE LIKE A GROSE TAST
11771,IT SHOWS LIKE A LIKE A LIKE A SOME KIND OF OF DRINK THAT MAKES IT GROW FOOD,IT SHOWES LIKE A LIKE A LIKE A SOME KIND OF OF DRINK THAT MAKES IT GROW FL
11772,IT'S BECAUSE THEY DO THEIR OWN PHOTOSYNTHESIS WHICH THEY MAKE THEIR OWN FOOD,IT'S BECAUSE THEY DO THEIR OWN PONETS IND IS TO SWISH THEY MAKE THEIR OWN FOOD
11773,IT HAS ALL THREE THINGS WATER AIR AND SUNSHINE,THAT HAS ALL THREE THINGS WATER AIR AND SUNSH
11774,I THINK ANYTHING ELSE TO POINT OUT TO ME IS LIKE WHEN THE YEAST KIND OF LIKE RISES FROM THE BREAD EXCEPT IT GETS IT PUFFY FOR THE AIR OR CARBON DIOXIDE THAT FLOWS IN THE BAG,I THINK UHM ANYTHING ELSE O POINT OUT TO ME IS LIKE WHEN THE UST KIND OF LIKE RISES FROM A BREAD EXCEPT IT GETS A PUFFY FOR THE CAR LIKE AIROR CARM DI OU SCIDE THAT FLOWS IN THE BA
11775,YES IT CAN BECAUSE IF IT DOESN'T HAVE ANY SUNSHINE IT WILL TURN LIKE FIRST DAY IT WILL TURN TAN THEN IT WILL TURN YELLOW NOT GREEN,YES IT CAN BE CAUSE UHM IF IT DOESN'T HAVE ANY SUNSHINE IT WILL TURN LIKE UHM FIRST DAY IT WILL TURN TAN THAT IT WILL TURN YELLOW NOT GRE
11776,IT'S ALL HEALTHY AND BECAUSE IT HAS ALL THREE THINGS WATER AIR AND SUNSHINE,IT'S ALL HEALTHY AN NEW TREE BECAUSE IT HASE ALL THREE THINGS WATER AIR AND SUNSHI
11777,WHAT I OBSERVE IS LIKE LITTLE TINY PARTICLES INSIDE THE YEAST WHEN IT'S LIKE KIND OF LIKE MIXED WITH THE WATER,WHAT A OBSERRVE IS LIKE LITTLE TITY PARTICLES INSIDE THE EAST WHEN IT'S LIKE HOW LIKE MIXED WITH THE WATER
11778,IT'S A HOUSE,IT'S A HOUS
11779,WHAT'S IMPORTANT ABOUT PRODUCERS IS BECAUSE THEY MAKE THEIR OWN FOOD AND ONCE A CONSUMER COMES BECAUSE THEY CAN'T MAKE THEIR OWN FOOD THEY HAVE TO EAT SOMETHING THAT'S WHY THEY EAT THE PRODUCERS,WHAT'S IMPORT ABOUT PRODUCEUSIS BECAUSE UHM THEY MAKE THEIR OWN FOOD AND THEY WANTS A CONCUMER COMES BECAUSE UHM THEY CAN'T MAKE THEIR OWN FOOD THEY HAVE TO EAT SOMETHING THAT'S WHY THE THE PRODUCERS
11780,THAT MEANS IT'S A ALL AND HEALTHY PLANT,THAT MEANS IT'S A ALL NEW TRATED AND HEALTHY PLAN
11781,IT'S BECAUSE THEY NEED LIGHT ENERGY CARBON DIOXIDE AND WATER SO ALL THOSE THINGS SO IT CAN PRODUCE IT'S OWN FOOD WITHOUT THOSE THREE THINGS IT CAN NOT GROW,IT'S BECAUSE THEY NEED LIGHT AN ERGY CARMDI OUTSIDE AND WATER SO ALL THOSE RINGS SO UHM IT CAN PRODUCE ITS OWN FOOD WITHOUT THOSE THREE THINGS IT CANNOT GROW
11782,THERE IS ONE OF LIKE PARALLEL THERE IS THAT IS PALMATE AND THERE'S ONE THAT IS PARALLEL,THERE IS ONE OF LIKE PARRELLELL THERE IS ONE THAT IS PALLMAY AND THERE 'S ONE THAT IS PARRELLELL
11783,SOME EXAMPLES ARE SIMPLE LEAF PARALLEL LEAF AND PALMATE LEAF,SOME EXAMPLES ARE SIMPIF PARLELIF AND PALL MA LEAF
11784,I THINK THE VEINS ARE FOR LIKE THEY ALSO USE LIKE THE BLOOD WHICH IT PUMPS IN KIND OF LIKE THE HUMAN BODY'S VEINS,I THINK THE VAINS ARE FOUR LIKE UHM THEY ALSO USE LIKE THE BUD UH WHICH IT PUMPS INKIN LIKE THE HUMAN BODYS VAINS
11785,I'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT VEINS FROM LEAVES AND FROM SAP FROM TREES AND ALSO SOME OTHER STUFF FROM SCIENCE,I'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT VAINS FROM LEAVES AND FROM SAP FROM TREES AND ALSO SOME OTHER STUFF FROM SCIENCE
11786,ONE IS CALLED SIMPLE ANOTHER IS PALMATE AND THE THIRD ONE IS PARALLEL,ONE IS CALLED SIMPLE ANOTHER IS PALMY AND THE THIRD ONE IS PARRELELL
11787,I THINK IT COMES FROM THE AIR CAUSE KIND OF LIKE FROM THE CLOUDS IT GIVES LIKE WATER OUT ONCE IT RAINS SO I THINK THAT'S WHY,I THINK IT COMES FROM THE AIR CUS KIND LIKE FROM THE CLOUDS IT GIVES LIKE WATER OUT ONCE IT RAINS SO I THINK THAT'S WY
11788,IT IS THE PATTERN OF THEIR VEINS AND ALSO THE OUTSIDE SHAPE WHICH IT WAS BORN WITH,IT IS THE PATTERN OF THEIR VAINS AND ALSO THE OUTSIDE SHAPE WHICH IT WAS BORN WITH
11789,THAT TELLS ME THAT IT IS A SIMPLE LEAF,THAT TELLS ME THAT IT IS A SIMBLLIEAF
11790,I THINK IT'S A SIMPLE LEAF BECAUSE IT'S KIND OF LIKE HALF AND HALF AND IT'S ALL PARALLEL AND IT'S KIND OF LIKE THE SAME ON HALF,I THINK IT'S A SIMBLLIEVED BECAUSE UHM IT'S KIND OF LIKE HALF AND HALF AND IT'S ALL PARELELL AND IT'S KIND LIKE THE SAME ON HALF
11791,I THINK IT IS A SIMPLE LEAF BECAUSE IT'S VEINS ARE GOING KIND OF LIKE A CIRCULAR OUTSIDE DIRECTION,I THINK IT IS A SIMPLLY BECAUSE ITS VAINS ARE GOING N LIKE A CIRCULR OUTSIDE DIRECTION
11792,HOW IT GETS IT'S NUTRIENTS AND THAT'S GETTING OUT OF IT KIND OF LIKE THE CARBON DIOXIDE IT'S BREATHE I MEANT SORRY THE OXYGEN IT'S BREATHING OUT,HOW W GET IS  NEW TREEAS AND THE XIAMS THAT'S GETTING OUT OF I KIN LIKE THE UHM CARBONDOXCIDE IT'S BREATHE I MENT SORRY THE OXYGEN IT'S BRETHING OUT
11793,I THINK IT WAS SOMEBODY THAT PUT A GUY A BAG AND POURED WATER IN IT OR MAYBE IT WAS JUST RAIN,I THINK IT WAS SOMEBODY THAT UHM UHM PUT A GOT A BAG AND PORED WATER IN IT OR MAYBE IT WAS JUST RAIN
11794,IT IS THE AIR AND WATER I SEE LIKE PARTICLES OF AIR AND PARTICLES OF WATER,IT IS THE AIRN WATER I SEE LIKE PARTICLES OF AIR AND PARTICLES OF WATER
11795,LIKE THE PHLOEM IS LIKE GOING DOWN IN THE PLANT LIKE IT'S NUTRIENTS AND PROBABLY THAT KIND OF LIKE THE OXYGEN THAT'S COMING OUT OF IT,LIKE THE POLEM IS LIKE GOING DOWN IN THA PLANT LIKE ITS NEW TREEINS AND PROBABLY AXLAN THAT UHM LIKE KIND OF LIKE THE OXYGEN THAT'S COMING OUT OF IT
11796,I AM DOING GOOD TODAY,I AM NOT DOING GOOD TODAY
11797,THAT IT HAS LIKE DIFFERENT THINGS LIKE LIKE THE NUTRIENTS GO INSIDE AND THEN SOMETHING ELSE GOES OUTSIDE OF IT,THAT IT HAS LIKE DIFFERENT THINGS LIKE UHM LIKE THE NEW TRAINS GO IN SIDE AND THEN SOMETHING ELSE GOATS OUTSIDE OF IT
11798,THE ESOPHAGUS IT DOES THAT PUSHES ALL THE FOOD DOWN INTO THE STOMACH,THE SOFFIST GESS IT DOES UHM THAT IT PUSHES ALL THE FOOD DOWN INTO THE STOUMIC
11799,MOUTH THE MOUTH USUALLY JUST CHEWS IT AND SWALLOWS IT,MOUTH THE MOUTH USALLY JUST CHUSE IT AND UHM UHM SWOLLOWS IT
11800,OH IT IT PUSHES DOWN ALL THE CHEWED UP FOOD LIKE IT LIKE THOSE LITTLE BITS SO IT COULD LIKE FIT THROUGH THAT KIND OF LIKE LITTLE TUBE OF THE ESOPHAGUS,OH IT IT UHM PUSHES DOWN ALL THE CHOD OP FOOD UHM LIKE IT LIKE THOSE LITTLE BITS SO IT K LIKE UMFIT THROUGH THAT C LIKE LITTLE TOUBE OF THES SOFI GESS
11801,I SEE,IS
11802,JUST TO USUALLY JUST TO BREAK DOWN THE FOOD AND ONCE YOU'RE HUNGRY YOU EAT SOME SO IT WON'T GO KIND OF LIKE HUNGRY FOR A LITTLE BIT,JUST O USUALLY JUST UHM BREAK DOWN THE FOOD AND WONCE YOU'RE HUNGRY YOU EAT SOME SO IT WON'T GO UHM KIND LIKE HUNGRY FOR A LITTLE BIT
11803,I THINK WHAT'S FOR THE MUSCLE CELLS IS LIKE THEY HELP YOUR MUSCLES GROW OR SOMETHING OR I THINK THEY'LL HELP YOU MOVE IT,I THINK WHAT'S FOR THE MUSCLE SELLES IS LIKE UHM THE HELPS YOUR MUSCLES LIKE GROW OR SOMETHING OR I THINK THE'LL HELP YOU MOVE IT
11804,THEY ARE PROBABLY MADE OUT OF MEAT,THEY ARE PROBABLY MADE OUT OF MEATS
11805,LIKE IN A DIGESTIVE SYSTEM IT HAS TO HAVE LIKE SOME KIND OF CELLS CAUSE MAYBE LIKE THE SALIVA THAT'S BEEN IN YOUR MOUTH ONCE YOU EAT IT MAYBE THOSE CELLS KIND OF LIKE BREAK IT DOWN,LIKE IN TA DIJUSTIF SISTOM IT HAS TO HAVE LIKE SOME KI OF SELLS CAUSE MAYBE LIKE THIS ALIVA THAT SPEND YOUR MOUTH ONCE YOU EAT IT MAYBE THOSE SELLES KIND LIKE BREAK IT DOWN
11806,THINK THE LEAF HAS LIKE A TON OF,AK BELIEF HAS LIKE A TON
11807,THERE ARE LIKE ALL SORTS OF CELLS AND MAYBE THEY CARRY THE NUTRIENTS FOR THE ARM SO THE SKIN'S HEALTHY,THEY ARE LIKE ALL SORTS OF SELLS AND MAYBE THEY CARRY THE NEW TREE NS FOR THE ARMS SO THE SKINS HEALTHY
11808,DOING GOOD,DOING GOOD
11809,THEY USUALLY JUST BREAK DOWN THE FOOD WHICH YOU EAT WHEN YOU'RE HUNGRY,A USUALLY JUST BREAK DOWN THE FOOD WHICH YOU EAT WHEN YOU'RE HUNGRY
11810,I THINK WHAT THEY ARE IS LIKE SOME KIND OF LIKE NUTRIENTS THAT HELP THE SKIN LIKE STAY LIKE HEALTHY AND STAYS SMOOTH,I THINK WHAT THEY ARE IS LIKE UHM SOME KIND OF LIKE NEW TREES THAT HELP THE SKIN LIKE STAY LIKE HEALTHY AND E SMOOTH
11811,IT'S TRYING TO SHOW ME THOSE BRAIN CELLS,IT'S TRYING TO SHOW ME THOSE BRAN BRAIN SELLS
11812,WHAT THE MOUTH DOES IS ONCE YOU CHEW IT GOES DOWN INTO YOUR BODY INTO THE STOMACH,WHAT THE MOUTH DOES IS WHEN ONCE YOU CHEW IT GOES DOWN INTO YOUR BODY INTO HE STOMICK
11813,WHAT I NOTICE ABOUT IT IS A HUMAN BODY AND I THINK IT'S POINTING TO CERTAIN THINGS WHERE THE CELLS ARE FOR MOST IMPORTANT STUFF,WHAT I NOTICED ABOUT IS A HUMAN BODY AND I THINK IT'S POINTIG UHM TO SERIN THINGS WHERE THE SELLVES ARE FORE MOST IMPORTANT STUFF
11814,I THINK THE BUTTERFLY HAS CELLS BECAUSE IT NEEDS SOME KIND IF THING LIKE IT LIKE SUCKS UP POLLEN,I THINK THE BUTTERFLY HASLIS BECAUSE UHM IT NEEDS SOME KIND OF THING LIKE IT LIKE SOOKS UP POLLEN
11815,WHAT IT TELLS ME IS LIKE THERE'S LIKE HUGE CELLS AND LIKE THERE'S LESS CELLS IN A LEAF BECAUSE THEIR ALL ALL THE CELLS ARE IN ONE SECTION,WHAT IT TELLS ME IS LIKE THERE IS LIKE HUGE SELLVES AND W THERE'S LESS SELLVES IND A LEAF BECAUSE ERE ALL ALL THE SELLVES ARE IN ONE SEXS
11816,I SEE ALL SORTS OF CELLS AND I SEE SOME VEINS PLUS I SEE THE SKIN,I SEE ALL SORTSOF SHELLS AND I SEE SOME VANGS PLUS UHM I SEE THE SKIN
11817,IT USUALLY JUST USUALLY JUST PUSHES IT DOWN INTO THE STOMACH THAT'S PROBABLY WHICH I ALL KNOW,IT USUALLY JUST USUALLY JUST PUSHES IT DOWN INTO THE STUMMIC THAT'S PROBABLY WHICH I ALL KNOW
11818,THEY ARE THEY ARE ALL SORTS OF CELLS,THEY THEY ARE ALL SORTS OF SELLS
11819,THEY BOTH DRINK,THEY BOTH DRANK
11820,LIKE IT'S KIND OF LIKE ALL IN THE DIGESTIVE SYSTEM LIKE ALL OVER YOUR BODY LIKE SOMEHOW IT COULD LIKE BREAKS IT DOWN OR HAS A CERTAIN JOB TO DO FOR THE WHOLE BODY,LIKE IT'S KIND OF LIKE ALL IN THE DIJUSTIF'S SISTOM LIKE ALL OVER YOUR BODY LIKE SOME HOW IT  LIKE BREAKS IT DOWN OR HAS ACERTIN JOB TO DO FOR THE WHOLE BODY
11821,I NOTICE THAT WHAT THIS IS SIMILAR TO THEM THAT THEY HAVE CELLS,I NOTICE THAT UHM WHAT THIS IS SIMALER TO THEM THAT THEY HAVE SELVES
11822,I THINK WHAT IT'S TRYING TO SHOW US IS LIKE ONCE YOU EAT IT WHERE IT GOES THROUGH AND HOW LIKE THE STEPS WHERE IT GOES THROUGH TO BREAK DOWN ALL THE FOOD AND THEN YOU PEE IT OUT,I THINK WHAT IT'S TRYING TO SHOW US IS LIKE W UHM WHENCE YOU EAT IT WHERE IT GOES THROUGH AND HOW LIKE THE STEPS WHERET GOES THROUGH TO BREAK DOWN ALL THE FOOD AND THEN YOU PEA IT OUT
11823,I SEE LIKE SHAPES KIND OF LIKE A AND MAYBE THERE WILL BE ALL SORTS OF CELLS KIND OF LIKE A TO TELL LIKE MESSAGES TO THE BODY,I SEE LIKE SHAPES KINDOF LIKE OF SPARKS AND MAYBE THERE'LL BE ALL SORTS OF SELVES KIND LIKE A MOVING TO TELL LIKE MESSAGES TO THE BBODY
11824,I THINK WHAT THE MUSCLE CELLS ARE LIKE THEY HELP YOUR MUSCLES MOVE,I THINK WHAT THE MUAL SELLES ARE LIKE THEY HELP YOUR MUSCLES MOVE
11825,I THINK THEY ARE BECAUSE THEY BOTH HAVE BLOOD INSIDE OF EACH OTHER,I THINK THEY ARE BECAUSE THEY BOTH HAVE BLOD INSIDE OF EACH OTHER
11826,I THINK THIS WAS TRYING TO SHOW IS KIND OF LIKE THE YEAST IS KIND OF LIKE THE SKIN OF A HUMAN BODY,I THINK IT WAS TRYING TO SHOW IS K LIKE THE EAST IS K LIKE THE SKIN OF A HUMAN BODY
11827,BUT I ALSO KNOW IS JUST TRAVELS ALL ALONG WITH THOSE CELLS LIKE WITH THE FOOD HOW LIKE SIDE BY SIDE OR LIKE IN A LINE OR SOMETHING,BUT I ALSO KNOW IS JUST TRAVELS ALL ALONG WITH THEMSELVES LIKE WITH THE FOOD  EKESIDED BY SIDE OR LIKE IN A LINE OR SOMETHING
11828,THAT IT HAS ALL CELLS BECAUSE IT'S A LIVING ORGANISM,THAT IT HAS ALL SELLVES BECAUSE IT'S A LIVING ORGONISOM
11829,I THINK WHAT THOSE BRAIN CELLS LIKE THEY LIKE SEND MESSAGES TO THE BODY LIKE LIKE TELL THE HAND TO MOVE,I THINK WHAT THOSE BRAINS SOS LIKE THEUHM LIKE SEMD MESSAGES TO THE BODY LIKE UHM LIKE TL THE HAND TO MOVE
11830,IT'S THE GASTRIC JUICE IN THE ACID,IT'S SA GASTIC JUCE IN THE ASID
11831,THE SKIN CELLS ARE FOR LIKE YOUR SKIN SO THEY STAY HEALTHY,THE SKINSELLS ARE FOR LIKE YOUR SKINS SO THEY STAY HEALTHY
11832,I THINK THEY'RE BOTH DIFFERENT CELLS BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT WORKING FOR LIKE LIKE YEAST CELLS ARE NOT WORKING FOR HUMAN CELLS,I THEYRE BOTH DIFFERENT SELVES BECAUSE UHM THEY ARE NOT UHM WORKING FOR LIKE UHM LIKE UHM GASH SHELVES ARE NOT WORKING FOR HUMANSELVES
11833,I'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT THE DIGESTIVE SYSTEM AND ALSO I'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT LIKE HOW IT WORKS THROUGH YOUR BODY,I'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT THE DIEJUSTIF SISTOM AND ALSO I'VE BEN LEARNING ABOUT LIKE UHM HOW IT WORKS UHM THROUGH YOUR BODY
11834,IT WAS IMPORTANT BECAUSE THEY HAVE TO BE GOOD IN HAVE TO PUT IN GOOD AND IF IF THEY'RE NOT WELL DONE THEY CAN BREAK,IT I'S IMPORTANT BECAUSE HEY HAVE TO BE GOODDING TEY HAVE TO PUT IN GOOD AND IF IF THEY'RE NOT WELL DOM THEY CAN BREAK
11835,I THINK WHAT I WOULD LIKE TO TEST IS SEEING SEEING HOW FAR IT GOES AND SEEING THE LI THE BLOCK CAN GO BE HEAVIER,I THINK WHAT I WOULD LIKE TO TEST IS SEEING SEING HOW FAR IT GOES AND SEING THE LITTLE THE BLACK AND GO BEHEAVIER
11836,I THINK IT'S,THANK YOU TO MUNDY
11837,WE HAVE SEEN A FLIPPER SYSTEM,WE HAVE TO SEENOUGH HOT FOR SISTOM
11838,GOOD BYE,GOODBYE
11839,YOU NEED A SOMETHING TO MAKE IT FLIP YOU NEED YOU NEED A STICK AND TO MEASURE IT,YOU NEED SOMETHING TO MAKE IT FLIP YOU NEED YOU NEED A STICK AND TO MEASURE IT
11840,I THINK YOU WOULD JUST BY UM FOR EXAMPLE YOU CAN SAY THE BROOK HOLDS THE STICK IN AND IT MAKES IT AND YOU MEASURE IT AND IT MAKES IT GO IN,I THINK YOU WOULD DESCRIBE IT BY UHM FOR EXAMPLE YOU CAN SAY THE BROOK COLDS THE STICKEN AND IT MAKES IT IN YOU MEASURE IT AND IT MAKES IT GOONE
11841,IT MAKES IT A SYSTEM BECAUSE THE PROPELLER'S SPINNING AROUND,IT MAKES IT ASISTAMT BECAUSE THE PROPELLER IS SPINNING AROUND
11842,I THINK WE HAVEN'T,I THINK WE HAVEN'T
11843,WE HAVE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT FLIPPERS AND WE HAVE BEEN YEAH WE HAVE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT FLIPPERS,WE HAVETER LEARNING ABOUT FLIPPERS AND WE HAVE ABAND YEHAVE YO AVE T IN LEARNING ABOUT FORPERS
11844,I THINK WHAT YOU CAN CHANGE YOU CAN,UA HEAVIER B BLOCK TO SEE IF IT GOS FARTHER
11845,I THINK WHAT THAT IS ALL ABOUT IS MEASURING IT AND SEEING HOW FAR IT GOES,I THINK WHAT THAT IS ALL ABOUT IS MEASURING I AND SEING HOW FAR IT GOS
11846,I THINK WHAT'S GOING ON THERE IT MAKES A GOOD FLIPPER SYSTEM BECAUSE IT BOUNCES OFF AND IT HOLDS IT TIGHT AND YOU DON'T WANT TO BOUNCE IT OFF THAT HIGH BECAUSE THE THE STICK CAN BREAK,I THINK WHAT'S GOING ON THERE IT MAKES AG FOUPER SISTOM BECAUSE IT BOUNDS IT SOFT AND IT HOLDS IT TIGHT AND YOU DO'T WANT A BOUNTS IT OF THAT HIGHT BECAUSE IT BIT SICK CAN BREAK
11847,I'M VERY GOOD,AND VERY GOOD
11848,YOU CAN ALSO UM DO A SMALLER STICK AND SEE YEAH YOU CAN DO THAT TOO,YOU CAN ALSO UHMDU A SMALLER STICK AND TO SEE THT YOU CAN DO THAT TOO
11849,WHEN YOU CLICK IT IT BOUNCES OFF,WHEN YOU CICK IT IT BOUNCE IS OFF
11850,THESE ARE ALL ABOUT MEASURING HOW FAR THE BROOK GOES AND SEEING IF IT GOES THAT FAR,THESE OBJECTS ARE ALL ABOUT MEASURING HOW FAR THE BROOCKGOES AND SEEING IF IT GOES THAT FAR
11851,I FOUND OUT THAT YOU GET YOU'RE MEASURING IT AND THAT YOU'RE SEEING HOW FAR THE BROOK GOES AND IF IT DOESN'T GO THAT FAR YOU PUT THE CAPACITY YOU WRITE THE CAPACITY AND YOU,I FOUND OUT THAT YOU GET YOU MEASURING M AND THAT YOU'E SEING HOW FAR THE BROOKOS AND IF IT DOESN'T GO THAT FAR YOU PUT THE CAPASSITY YOU READ THE CAPASSITY AND YOU
11852,UM YOU CAN FLIP,YOU CAN DO THIS EXPERIMENT YOU CAN D
11853,UM YOU CAN THINK OF,UHM YOU CAN THINK OUT
11854,I THINK WHAT THE BASE IS ALL ABOUT IS MEASURING IT AND LIKE SEEING IF IT GOES FAR,I THINK WHAT THE BASIS ALL ABOUT IS MEASURING IT AND LIKE SEEING IF IT GOES FAR
11855,I THINK WHAT IS UP WITH THAT OBJECT WOULD BE UM SEEING HOW FAR IT GOES MAYBE,AND I THINK WHAT IS UP WATH THAT OBJECT WOULD BE UHM SEEING HOW FAR IT GO MAYBE
11856,UM YOU CAN THE BLOCK THAT HOLDS THE STICK IT CAN BE SMALLER OR IT CAN BE HEAVIER,UHM YOU CAN THE BLOCK THAT HOLDS THE STICK IT CAN BE SMALLER OR IT CAN BE HEAVIER
11857,THERE IS SOMETHING ON THE ON TOP OF IT AND THAT YOU HOLD IT YOU PUT IT UNDER THE BLOCK AND YOU JUST FLIP IT AND YOU SEE HOW FAR IT GOES,THERE IS SOMETHING ON HE ON THE TOP OF IT AND THE YOU HOLD IT YOU PUT IT UNDER THE BLOCK AND YOU'D JUST SLIP IT AND YOU SEE HOW FAR IT GOES
11858,IT CONNECTS IT BY PUTTING THE STICK ON THE BOTTOM OF THE BRICK AND IF IT GOES FAR YOU JUST PUSH IT IN YOU JUST TAKE IT OUT AND IT'S AND THEN JUST PUT IT,IT CONVECS IT BY PUTTING THE STICK ON THE BOTTOM OF THE BRICK AND A FITGLS FAR YOU JUSPRESIDN'T YOU' JUST TAKE IT OUT AND IT' AND THEN JUST PUT IT
11859,SPINNING THE RUBBERBAND AROUND AND SEEING HOW HOW FAR IT GOES,I THINK IT IS ALL ABOUND
11860,SYSTEMS ARE ALL ABOUT MEASURING AND DOING SEEING SEEING WHAT HOW THE SYSTEM LOOKS,SISTOMS ARE ALL ABOUT MEASURING AND  SAYING SNG WH HOW THE SISTOM LOOKS
11861,WHAT'S GOING ON WITH THAT IS THAT WE HAVE TO LEARN ABOUT PENDULUMS WE HAVE TO LEARN HOW TO P HOW TO DO SCIENCE AND AND TO LEARN MORE THINGS,T'S GOING ON WITH THAT IS THAT WE HAVE TO LEARN ABOUT PENDALLAMS EN WE HAVE TO LEARN HOW TO PU HOW TODO SCIENCS AND AN TO LEARN MORE THINGS
11862,NO SOME OF THEM HOLD TEN OR NINE,NO SOME OF THEM HOLD TEN OR NINE
11863,VERY WELL,S VERY WELL
11864,YOU CAN BUILD THEM OUT OF LIFEBOATS YOU CAN BUILD THEM OUT OF WOOD,YOU CAN BULD THEM UT OF LIE BOARTS YOU CAN BULL THEM UD OF WOOD
11865,LEARN ABOUT O,RAN ABOUT O
11866,I I THINK I'M NOT SURE I THINK YOU HAVE TO MEASURE THIRTY CENTIMETERS ON THEM AND WE LEARNED HOW TO HOW MANY PENDULUMS THAT IT CAN HOLD AND HOW MUCH WATER IT CAN HOLD,I I THINK I'M NOT SURE I THINK YOU HAVE TE MEASURED THIRTY SENT METORS ON THEM AND WE LEARN HOW T HOW MANY PENDALLUMS THA IT CAN HOLD AND HOW MUCH WATER IT CAN HOLD
11867,ABOUT ELEVEN AND C COULD HAVE TEN AND THE SHORTEST ONE COULD HAVE EIGHT,ABOUT ELEVEN AND SLE COULD HAVE TEN AND THE SHURTEST ONE COULD HAVE EIGHT
11868,I THINK IT COULD CONNECT TO THE CAPACITY OF THE BOAT WOULD BE WE CAN JUST MEASURE MEASURE EM AND IT CAN BE EIGHTY MILLIMETERS OR SIXTY TWO MILLIMETERS THIRTY EIGHT FIFTY FIVE MILLIMETERS,I THINK IT CI CANET TO THE CA PASSIGE OF THE BOAT WOULD BE  CAN JUST MEASURE MEASURE IM AND IT CAN BE EIGHTY MLIMTERS OUR SIXTY TWO MILLMITERS THIRTY EIGHT FIFTY FIVE MILLIONETORS
11869,BYE,BY
11870,I'VE BUILT MINE OUT OF PA OUT OF PAPER CUPS,I BUILT MINE OUT OF PATE OUT OF PAPER CUP
11871,FIRST YOU HAVE TO MEASURE A THE BOAT AND SEE AND PUT IT IN THE WATER AND YOU I THINK YOU MEASURE THIRTY CENTIMETERS ON THEM AND THEN YOU'D NEED TO,FIRST YOU HAVE TO MEASURE UP THE BOAT AND SEE AND PUT IT IN THE WATER AND YOU I THINK YOU MEASURED THIRTY SENTS AN METERS ON THEM AND THEN YOU NEED TO
11872,WHY I THINK THEY GOT A DIFFERENT NUMBER OF PENNIES IS BECAUSE THEY CUTTED THEM SHORTER OR LONGER,WHY I THINK THE GARDD I FRONT NUMBER OF PENDACES BECAUSE THEY CAUGHT AT THEM SHORTER OR LONGER
11873,I WOULD THINK ABOUT PUTTING PENNIES IN IT OR WATER,I WOULD THINK ABOUT PUTTING PENNIES IN I OR WATER
11874,I DISCOVERED THAT THE BOAT CAN FIT TWELVE TWELVE PENDULUMS IN THE LITTLE BOAT,I DISCOVERED THAT THE BOAT CAN FID TWELVE TWELVE PENDALLUMSOM IN THE LITTLE BOAT
11875,WHEN I WHEN I NOTICED THAT A WASN'T DROWNING THAT MUCH I STARTED PUTTING MORE AND MORE UH PENDULUMS IN EM AND WHEN I DROWNED IT I I GOT MY ANSWER REALLY EASILY,WHEN I WHEN I NOTICED THAT I WASN'T DROWNING THAT MUCH I STARTED PARTING MORE AND MORAL PENDALLUMS AN HIM AND WHEN IT DROWNDED I I GOT MY ANSWER REALLY EASILY
11876,WE HAVE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT BOATS AND WE HAVE BEEN PUTTING PENDULUMS IN THE BOATS AND SEEING HOW MANY PENDULUMS CAN FIT INSIDE THE LITTLE BOAT,WE HAVE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT BOATS AND WE HAVE BEEN PUTTING PENDALLUMS IN THE BOATS AND SEEING HOW MANY PENDALLUMS CAN FITE INSIDE THE LITTLE BOAT
11877,WE,WE
11878,THE LIFEBOATS ARE ALL ABOUT YOU GO YOU CAN GO ON A ROMANTIC DATE YOU CAN,UHM GO TO THE RIVER AND GET ON THEN YOU CAN HAVE A PICK NICK IN THEM
11879,WHAT IS GOING ON THERE IS THE PROPELLER IS THE STRING IS MAKING IT BALANCE IT AND IT KEEPS GOING AROUND AND AROUND PROPELLER KEEPS GOING AROUND AND AROUND,WHER IS GOING ON THERE IS THE PPOLOR THE STRING IS MICKING A BALANCEA AND HIT KEEPS GOING AROUND AND AROUND TH PEOPLE WHOT KEEPS GOING AROUND AND AROUND
11880,I THINK IT WILL BECAUSE IT HAS TO HAVE MORE POWER ON IT AND IT HAS TO GO UP FARTHER AND I THINK THAT WOULD AFFECT IT,I THINK IT WILL BECAUSE IT HAS TO HAVE MORE POWER ANAT AND IT HAS TO GO UP FARTHER AND I THINK THAT WOULD EFFECT THIT
11881,SO IT HAS ALSO BEEN NICE TALKING TO YOU MARTY,IS ALL IT HAS ALSO BEEN NICE THALKING TO YOU MARDY
11882,WHAT WE'VE BEEN DOING IN SCIENCE WE WERE WE HAVE BEEN DOING AIRPLANES WE HAVE BEEN SEEING IS THE AIRPLANE PROPELLER CAN FLY,WH'VE EVEEN DOING IN SCIENCE WE WER WE HAVE BEEN DOING AIRPLANES AND WE HAVE BEEN SEEING IF THE AIRPLANE PERPELLER CAN FLY
11883,THANK YOU,PINKI
11884,THANK YOU,THANK YOU
11885,I THINK WHEN SETTING UP YOUR MY EXPERIMENT WAS IT WAS TRICKY TO PUT IT TOGETHER BUT IT WORKED REALLY WELL AND,I THINK WHENE SETTING UP THERE AT MY EXPERIMENT WAS IT WAS TRICK TO PUT IT TOGETHER BUT IT WORKED REALLY WELL AND
11886,IT'S GOING VERY WELL MARTY,'S GOING VERY WELL MARTY
11887,YOU CAN ALSO CHANGE THE PROPELLER YOU CAN USE FISHING YOU CAN USE FISHING WIRE AND YOU CAN MAKE THE PROPELLER SMALLER YOU CAN MAKE THE THE,YEAH
11888,YOU,DO
11889,OKAY SO HOW MANY SPINS IT TAKES SPINS ARE FORTY FIVE SPINS IT MADE AND THE DISTANCE IS HOW MUCH METER HOW MUCH METERS YOU MEASURE IT,OKASA HOW MANY SPINDS IT TAKES SPINS ARENT FOURTY FIVE SPENDS IT MADE IN THE DISTANCE IS HOW MUCH METOR HOW MUCH METERS YOU MEASURE IT
11890,SO WHAT THE PARTS OF THE PLANE I USE THE PROPELLER IS MAKING IT SPIN AND THE STRING THE STRAW AND THE STRING IS MAKING IT BALANCE IT,SO WHAT THE PARTS OF THE PLANE ARE USED THE PROPELLOR IS MAKING A SPIN AND THE STRING THE STRAW IN THE STRING IS MAKING A BALENCE IT
11891,I THINK THE KINDS OF THINGS THAT ARE IMPORTANT WHAT MAKES IF FLY IS THE PROPELLER MAKES IT FLY AND THAT THE STRING IS BALANCED AND A AND THAT THE STRAW IS GREAT IS PUT GOOD ON IT,I THINK THE KINDS OF THINGS THAT ARE IMPORTANT WELL MAKES IT FLY IS A PREPOER MAKES IT FLY AND THAT THE STRING IS BALLENCED AND A AND THAT THE STRAW IS GR IS PU GOOD ON IT
11892,I THINK WHAT THAT IS ALL ABOUT IT MAKES THE PROPELLER SPIN AND IF WE DON'T HAVE THE RUBBER BAND IN THE BOTTOM IT'S NOT GOING TO WORK,I THINK WHAT THAT IS ALL ABOUT IT MAKES THE PREPELLER SPIN AND IF YOU DON'T HAVE THE A BRUN IN THE WATER MITES LICKON A WORK
11893,YOU HAVE TO THE PROPELLER IS ALL ABOUT MAKING THE PROPELLER SPIN,YOU HAVE TO THE PREPELLOR IS ALL ABOUT MAKING THE PREPELLOR SPIN
11894,WHEN IT SPINS THE THING ON THE BOTTOM SPINS AROUND TOO WITH IT AND M AND THEN YOU MEASURE HOW MUCH FAR IT WENT,WHEN SPINGS THE THING ON THE BOTTOM SPINS AROUND TO WITH IT AND AND AND THEN YOU' MEASURE HOW MUCH FAR IT RONT
11895,I THINK THE NUMBER OF SWINGS ISN'T RIGHT BECAUSE YOU HA ALSO THE STRING HAS TO BE BALANCED AND THE PROPELLER HAS TO BE MOVING,I THINK THE NUMBER OF SWINGS IS  AM RIGHT BECAUSE YOU HA ALSO THE STRING HAS TO BE BALENCE AND THE POPELLER HAS TO BE MOVING
11896,WITH STRING,NSTRING
11897,THANK YOU,THINK
11898,MARNIE,MIRTY
11899,I THINK WHAT IS IMPORTANT ABOUT THE FLYING LINE IS BECAUSE AND IT ATTACHES TO IT AND IT MAKES IT BALANCE AND IF E YOU DON'T HAVE IT ON THE BOTTOM IT'S GONNA NOT GO THAT FAST,I THINK WHAT IS IMPORTAN'T ABOUT THE FLYIING LINE IT'S BECAUSE IM IT ITTACHES TO IT AND THIT MAKES IT BALLENCE AND IFYOU DON'T HAVE IT ON THE BOTTOM IT'S GUN NOT GO THAT FAST
11900,OKAY,K
11901,WHAT YOU CAN ALSO DO WHEN THE PARTS ARE ALL WORKING TOGETHER IS YOU CAN PUT THE STRING INTO THE STRAW AND THEN YOU CAN JUST SWING IT ACROSS AND IT BALANCE IT AND IF IT DOESN'T BALANCE IT'S GOING TO WIGGLE A LOT,WHAT YOU CAN ALSOW DO WHEN THE PARTS AR ALL WORKING TOGETHER IS YOU CAN PUT THE STRING INTO THE STRAW AND THEN YOU CAN JUST SWING IT ACROSS AND IT BALENCE IT AND IF I DOESN'T BALENCE IS GETN A WIGG LOT
11902,OKAY,K
11903,I THINK THAT IF THE STRING ISN'T BALANCED THAT WELL IT'S NOT GONNA WORK IT'S NOT GONNA SPIN IT'S IT'S IT'S JUST NOT GONNA WORK,I THINK THAT IF THE STRING IS IN BALLENCED THERE WELL IT'S NOCT GON O WORKIT'S NOC ANOUGH SPIN IT'S IT'S JUST NC GONE O WORK
11904,YEAH THAT'S IT,THE PREPELLER ON IT AND THEN YOU NEED TO JUST STAPELE THE TWO OTHER OTHER UHM
11905,I AM VERY WELL HOW ARE YOU MARNIE,I AM WIR WELL HOW ARE YOU MARD
11906,I THINK THE OTHER THINGS THAT ARE IMPORTANT WHEN YOU ARE FLYING YOUR PLANE IS THAT IT'S REALLY BALANCED AND IT'S NOT WIGGLING A LOT AND THAT YOUR PROPELLER SPINS,I THINK OTHER THINGS THAT ARE IMPORAN WHEN YOURE FYING YOUR PLAN IS THAT IT'S RALLY BALENCE AND IT'S NOT WHEN WIGGLING A LAWT AND THAT YOUR PREPELLER SPIDS
11907,I THINK THE PROPELLERS ARE ALL ABOUT I AM GUESSING THAT THE PROPELLERS ARE TO KEEP IT BALANCED,I THINK THE PREPELLERS ARE ALL ABOUT I AM GUESSING THAT THE PEPELLERS ARE TO KEEP IT BALLENCE
11908,ME TOO,ME TO
11909,UM WELL MAYBE IT'S YOU HAVE TO PUT THE AIRPLANE HANGING ATTACHED TO A STRING AND YOU HAVE TO SEE HOW IF IT CAN FLY,UHMWELL MAYBE IT'S YOU HAVE TO PUT THE AIRPLANE HANGING ATTACHED TO A STRANG AND YOU HAVE TO SEE HOW IF  CAN FLY
11910,BYE IT'S BEEN NICE TALKING TO YOU TOO,BUY I'S BEN NICE TALKING TO YOU TOO
11911,I THINK HOW I MIGHT AFFECT IT IS BECAUSE THE SECOND ONE ISN'T REALLY WELL DONE AND IF IT GOES UP IT'S GONNA GO BACK DOWN AND THE FIRST ONE IS GONNA KEEP GOING STRAIGHT,I THINK HOW I MIGHT AFFECT IT IS BECAUSE THE SECOND ONE ISN'T REALLY WELL DONE AND IF IT GOS UP IT'S GOING TO GO BACK DOWN AND THE FIRST WINE I'S GOING TO KEEP GOING STRAIGHT
11912,I THINK IT'S BALANCING IT AND IT'S MAKING THE AIRPLANE FLY,I THINK IT'S BALENCING AND IT'S MAKING THE AIRPLAIN FLY
11913,THANK YOU,NU
11914,THE STRING WAS ALL ABOUT SEEING HOW FAST THE AIRPLANE COULD H FLY AND THE STRING,THE STRING WAS ALL ABOUT SEEING HOW FAST THE AIRPLANE COULD HAFLY AND THE STRING
11915,I THINK WHAT THAT WAS ALL ABOUT WAS,I THINK WHE THAT WAS ALL ABOUT WAS
11916,IT CAN STAY A MAGNET AS UM FOR A BIT LONGER THAN IT CAN STICK TO THE MAGNET BUT IT LOSES ITS MAGNETISM,IT CAN SAY AND MAGNETA UHM FOR A BIT LONGER THAN IT CCAN STICK TO THE MAGNET BUT IT LOSES ITS MAGNETISOM
11917,THE MAGNET RUBBING THE NAIL WILL GIVE SOME MAGNETISM TO THE NAIL SO IT CAN PICK UP THE PAPER CLIP,THE MAGNET RUBBING THE NAIL GIVE SOME MAGNATIZM TO THE NAIL SO IT CAN PICK UP THE PAPER CLIP
11918,THEY CAN GO THROUGH THIN OBJECTS AND ALSO THEY CAN CONNECT TO EACH OTHER WHEN THEY'RE OFF BUT THE MAGNETISM IS SO STRONG BETWEEN THE TWO MAGNETS THAT IT CAN PULL THROUGH THE TABLE,THEY CAN GO THROUGH FIN OBJECTS AND ALSO THEY CAN CONNECT TO EACH OTHER WHEN THEY RE OFF BUT THE MAGNETISOM IS SO STRONG BETWEEN THE TWO MAGNETS THAT IT CAN PULL THROUGH THE TABLE
11919,THIS MAGNET THAT WE'RE SHOWING HERE HAS BEEN CONNECTED CAUSE THE PAPER IS VERY THIN,THIS MAGNET THAT WERE SHOWING HERE HAS BEEN CONECTED ECAUSE THE PAPER IS VERY THIN
11920,THE MAGNET CA IS LIFTING UP THE NAIL THAT IS SENDING ELECTRONS TO THE TO THE PAPER CLIP,THE MAGNET  IS LIFTING UP THE NAIL THAT IS SENDING LECTR TIT THE FAVORITE CLIFF
11921,IF YOU DO NOT HAVE THE STRONGEST MAGNETISM IN YOUR MAGNET IT CANNOT GET THROUGH THICKER THINGS,IF YOU DO NOT HAVE THE STRONGEST MAGNEATISOM IN YOUR MAGNET IT CANNOT GET THROUGH FICKER THINGS
11922,NAIL PICKED UP THE NAIL PICKED UP THE PAPER CLIP BUT THEN IT LOST ITS MAGNETISM AND THEN AND THEN THE MAGNET CAME BACK TO GIVE IT MORE MAGNETISM AND IT COULD PICK UP THE PAPER CLIP AGAIN,A NAILE PICKED UP THE NAIL PICKED UP THE PAPER CLIP BUT THEN IT LOST ITS MAGNETISOM AND THEN AND THEN THE MAGNET CAME BACK TO GIVE IT MORE MAGNETTO THEM AND IT COULD PICK UP THE PAPER CLIP AGAIN
11923,A NAIL HAS SOME MAGNETISM IN IT TO PICK UP THE UM THE PAPER CLIP,A NAIL HAS SOME MAGNEATIZ A MINUTE TO PICK UP THE UHM THE PAPER CLIB
11924,THE NAIL CAN ONLY S UM STAY LIKE A MAGNET SO LONG BECAUSE CAUSE IT DOES NOT IT CANNOT KEEP AS A MAGNET CAN THE MAGNETISM THAT STAYS IN IT FOREVER,THE NAIL CAN ONLY SUHM STAY LIKE A MAGNET SO LONG BECAUSE CAUSE IT DOES NOT IT CANNOT KEEP AS A MAGNET CAN THE MAGNETISOM THAT STAYS IN IT FOREVER
11925,THE NAIL IS USING MAGNETISM TO UM KEEP THE PAPER CLIP ON IT BUT THE PAPER CLIP CAN ONLY STAY ON SO LONG CAUSE THE MAGNETISM UM WEARS OFF AFTER A WHILE,THE NAIL IS USING MAGNATIZOME TO UHM KEEP THE PAPER CLIP ON IT BUT THE PAPER CLIP CAN ONLY STAY ON SO LONG ASE THE MAGNATIZOME UHM WEARS OFF AFTER A WHILE
11926,WELL MAGNETS CAN STICK TO EACH OTHER BECAUSE THEY BOTH HAVE IRON AND THEY CAN ATTRACT BECAUSE THEY'RE ON DIFFERENT SIDES,WELL MAGNETS CAN STICK TO EACH OTHER BECAUSE THEY BOTH HAVE IRN AND THEY CAN ATTRACT BECAUSE THEYARE IN DIFFERENT SIDES
11927,THE NAIL CANNOT ALWAYS BE A MAGNET AND THE MAGNET IS ALWAYS A MAGNET,THE NAIL CANNOT ALWAYS BE A MAGNET AND THE MAGNET IS ALWAYS MAGNET
11928,THE NAIL IS NOT A MAGNET SO IT CAN'T PICK UP THE PAPER CLIP WHEN IT'S NOT CONNECTED TO THE MAGNET,THE NAIL IS NOT A MAGNET SO IT CAN'T PICK UP THE PAPER CLIP WHEN IT'S NOT CONECTED TO THE MAGNET
11929,MAGNETISM IS WHEN UM THE MAGNET CAN STICK TO THINGS WITH IRON IN THEM,AGNATISOME IS WHEN UHM THE MAGNET CAN STICK TO THINGS WITH IRN IN THEM
11930,IT IS PICKING UP SOMETHING WITH IRON IT JUST LIKE THE THE MAGNET IS DOING TO THE NAIL,IT IS PICKING UP SOMETHING WITH IRN IT JUST LIKE THA THE MAGNET IS DOING TO THE NAIL
11931,THE NAIL IS ACTING JUST LIKE IT CAN BE IN ITS OWN MAGNET BECAUSE IT IS USING THE MAGNET'S FORCE,THE NAIL IS ACTING JUST LIKE IT CAN BE AN ITS OWN MAGNET BECAUSE IT IS USING THE MAGNETS FORCE
11932,WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT MAGNETS,WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT MAGNETS
11933,I HAVE PUT IT THROUGH PAPER IT HAS GONE THROUGH SOME THIN TABLES AND ALSO IT STICKS TO ALL IRON,I HAVE PUT IT THROUGH PAPER IT HAS GONE THROUGH SOME THIN TABLES AND ALSO IT STICKS TO ALL IRN
11934,MAGNETS GOING THROUGH THINGS CAN ONLY GO THROUGH CERTAIN THINGS CAUSE THEY'RE NOT AS THICK AS OTHER THINGS,MAGNETS GOING THROUGH THINGS CAN ONLY GO THROUGH CERTAN THINGS CAUSE THY'RE NOT AS THICK AS OTHER THINGS
11935,THE PAPER CLIP CAN STAY ON THE UM ON THE NAIL FOR MANY TIMES AND FALLS WHEN THE MAGNET HAS NO MORE MAGNETISM IN IT IN IT,THE PAPER CLIP CAN STAY ON THE UHM OM THE NAIL FOR MANY TIMES AND FALLS WHEN THE MAGNET HAS NO MORE MAGNETTIS IN ITIN IT
11936,THE MAGNETS BOTH HAVE IRON IN THEM AND THEY'RE ON THE R THE DIFFERENT SIDES SO THEY ARE STILL ATTRACTING,THE MAGNETS BOTH HAVE IRN AND THEM AND THEYRE ON THE R THE DIFFERENT SIDES SO THEY ARE STILL ATTRACTING
11937,THE MAGNETS ON THE SAME TIME AND THE TABLE THI IS NOT THAT THIN I MEAN IT'S NOT THAT THICK SO IT MUS THEY MUST HAVE BEEN PULLING EACH OTHER BECAUSE MAGNETISM,E MAGNETS ON ERTH ON THE SAME TIME AND THE TABLE  IS NOT THAT THIN I MEAN T'S NOT THAT STHICK SO IT MU THEY MUST HAVE BEEN PULLING EACH OTHER BECAUSE  MAGNATISOM
11938,THE PAPER CLIP IS DROPPING OFF THE NAIL BECAUSE THE MAGNETIN MAGNETIS MAGNETISM BECAUSE OF MANY THINGS,THE PAPER CLIPP IS DROPPING UP THE NAILE BECAUSE THE MAGNETE MAGNETIZES MAGNETISOM BECAUSE OF MANY THINGS
11939,BYE,BY
11940,I KNOW THAT MAGNETS STICK TO IRON,I KNOW THAT MAGNET STICK TO IRN
11941,IF YOU RUB THE MAGNET ON THE NAIL IT'LL COLLECT ENOUGH FORCE SO THAT IT CAN PICK UP THE PAPER CLIP,IF YOU RUB THE MAGNET ON THE NAIL IT'LL CLEC ENOUGH FORCE SO THAT IT CAN PICK UP THE PAPER CLIP
11942,IF THE MAGNET TOUCHES THE NAIL THEN THEN IT CAN COME UP AND CREATE ITS OWN MAGNETISM,IF THE MAGNET TAUTCHES THE NAIL THEN THEN IT CAN COME UP AND CRATE ITS OWN MAGNATISOM
11943,MAGNET DOESN'T HAVE ENOUGH FORCE PICK UP THE PAPER CLIP SO THE PAPER CLIP FELL ON THE FLOOR INSTEAD OF GOING THROUGH LIKE THE THIN PIECE OF PAPER AND CONNECTING TO THE MAGNET,MAGNET DOESN'T HAVE ENOUGH FOURCE TO PICK UP THE PAPER CLIPS SO THE PAPER CLIP FELL ON THE FLOOR INSTEAD OF GOING THROUGH LIKE THE THIN PIECE OF PAPER AND CONECTING TO THE MAGNET
11944,THE NAIL IS ACTING LIKE A MAGNET BECAUSE THE MAGNET CAN PICK UP PAPER CLIPS TOO BECAUSE THEY HAVE IRON IN THEM,THE NAIL IS ACTING LIKE A MAGNET BECAUSE THE MAGNET CAN PICK UP PAPER CLIPS TOO BECAUSE THEY HAVE IRN IN THEM
11945,THE MAGNETISM GOES THROUGH THE NAIL AND GOES INTO THE PAPER CLIP SO THAT THE NAIL CAN HOLD THE PAPER CLIP UP,THE MAGNEATISOME GOES THROUGH THE NAILE AND GOES INTO THE PAPER CLIP SO THAT THE NAIL CAN HOLD THE PAPER CLIP UP
11946,I'M GOOD VERY GOOD,I'M GD VERY GOOD
