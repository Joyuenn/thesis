1292,actually the wind might also be helping evaporate,actuated when might also be helping evaporate
1293,well jungle is for moistness cause it has more rain but desert has even if you did put a little water there it'd evaporate really quickly cause the temperature is so hot,well jungle is fo emoistnus cause it has more brain by a desert has even if you did butbe do water there and evaporate vealy quickly cause the temperature is so hot
1294,different,ifferent
1295,when it's warm it loses more because um when it's warm that helps the evaporation,when it is warm it wozes more because um when it's warmd it helps the evaporation
1296,it would easily come and evaporate the water,it would easily come and evaporate the water
1297,when the air's full of moisture or when it's humid when well when the air is full of moisture it has less chance of evaporating but it's humid it has a way better chance of evaporating,when the air is for mor sure an when it's humad when well when the air's fol of moisture as the streans evaporate like human it's a w better chan ef evaporating
1298,um because it's pushing it away from the heat,um because it's pushing it away from the heat
1299,it evaporates and sometimes it makes a little rain cloud,it evaporates and sometimes it makes a little rain craft
1300,it evaporates less than the desert,it evaporates west and a desert
1301,well cause well it kinda slows it down cause it pushes the water away instead of bringing it nearer for the um temperature to evaporate,well cause well it kind of soas it down't cause it pushes the water away instead of bring it nearr for the um temperature to evaporate
1302,good thank you,good thank you
1303,um we've been learning about evaporation,um we've been learning about evaporation
1304,when it's very cool like twenty two or twenty degrees or lower it only loses zero or one milliliter,well when it's a varible like twenty two or twenty degrees oror it only roses zero or one milliliter
1305,no i'm trying to say that more water evaporates in a desert than it does in a jungle,no i'm s trying to say ta more water evaporates in a desert than it doesin't te jungle
1306,well since you you can more see that b c d um that well the higher the temperature the more water loss,well sinc odomm you can more seed at b c t um that well the higher the temperature the more water was
1307,thank you marnie she's,thank you marnie she's
1308,well that's weird it's um the temperature is plus two for a and b then it's minus five for b and c and then it's minus two for d and c,well that's whe it it's um the temperature is plus two for a and b then it's minus five for b and c and thin it's minus two for d and c
1309,well we put em in different places to see if they evaporate faster,wul we pur in dfferent places to see if they evaporate faster
1310,we put one up high which is in the ceiling we put one by a computer which is near static electricity and we put one in the fridge which could be hot or warm or cold,we put one a phighe whish is in the steeling we put one by a computer which is neer steaic electricity and we put one in fridge which could be hot or warm or cold
1311,bye marnie it was very good to see you again um so um i hope other students get to have as much fun with you as i did bye spaghet spaghetti is what you say for spaghetti he he,bye marnie it was very good tosee you again um so um i hope isms to get the hous as mch for  if you as ey did bye pgspgacis what you say for s gt
1312,eah yes it is,uh yes it is
1313,the droplet is slowly getting out of the dropper and dropping on a penny which is gonna make a bigger dome dome is a scientific term and a normal,the drop weit is slow wiking o have the droppe and dropping on a penny which is going no make a bigger down don me the scientific term and a normal
1314,surface tension is when um is when water forms together to make a shape like a dome or um some other shape,survauce tension is when um is when water forms together to make a shape like a dome or m sunlighta shape
1315,um it makes uh form a small ball because all the water gathers together,um it makes a form a small ball because al th water gethers together
1316,the water drops all join together in one big object and um yeah so that's pretty much what it is basic,the water drops all during together and one big object and um yeah so it has pretty much what it is bs
1317,hydrone and oxygen are mixing and more water is gathering together,hydrona oxygen are mixing and more water is gaveling together
1318,um good thank you,i'm good thank you
1319,well cold water is making it move down but or south but hot water is making it move north or up,well cold water's making it move down but or south but hot water is making i move nor or up
1320,thank you,thank you
1321,cold,hold
1322,cork and cork um the cork and uh so it absorbs the water through the glass and it doesn't spill,cork and how work um the cork and um so it absorbs the water food to grass and it doesn't spell
1323,um room temperature is the temperature of the room,um room temperature is the temperature of the rom
1324,thank you,thank you
1325,it goes north or up cause the water is making it go up the heat actually um yeah so yeah basically,it goes north or up cause the water is making it go up to heat actually um yeah so yeah basically
1326,the temperature's hot so it's going up up up up up but if you make it go down then the temperature would going down down down and it would be have to be cold,the temperature is hot so it's going up up up u u but if you make it go down then the temperature would going down down down and it would be have to be cold
1327,i did an experiment in class and i know what happens,i didn't experiment in class and i know what happens
1328,i've been doing water uh,i've been doing water u
1329,hi,hi
1330,um i think it feels um cold,i think you feels um cold
1331,um temperature is all the hot and cold,um temperature is all about hot and cold
1332,d do you have anything else,do you have anything else
1333,when you make it colder it goes south way down but when you make it hotter it goes up or north,wen you make it colder equales south or down but when you make a hotter it goes up or north
1334,thank you and marnie can you say kitty cats,thank you and marnie can you say kidy cats
1335,chill he,trou
1336,more space marnie,more space marnie
1337,i no when um you're maybe doing a science experiment or again seeing when the temperature is outside,right no when um you're motor in ta science experiment oragain seen when the temperature is outside
1338,um something just came up oh okay,um seven just came up oh okay
1339,yes i have,yes i have
1340,temperature is um yeah it's hot and cold and when um it is hot it can make the water go up but when it's cold it goes down,ee
1341,yeah and yeah yeah but cause it would be um hurtful if,yeah i'd a yeah yeah but premrs aren't marceryanimore cause it would be um hurtful if
1342,thank you,thank you
1343,it goes down or um it takes up s a lot of space,it goes down or um ttakes up wes space
1344,we put a thermometer in it and then it tells you temperature if you want to be room temperature you let it stay in the room for a while maybe a day,well you put a thermometer in it and then it tells you  temperature if you want to be room temperature you wouldt stay in the room for a whire maybe day
1345,the temperature below it is hot,the temperature below it is higt
1346,it's about if it's i think it's not too hot not too cold and that would be room temperature wh and it's right there in the middle too hot would be too up too cold would be too down yeah,it's about if it's i think it's that to hot and ot too cold and that would be a room temperature wa and it's right there in the middle too hot it would be too up too cold  be too down yeah
1347,um thank you marnie can you say kitty cats,um thank you  marnie can you stay t get
1348,no cause i already knew about the thermometer so i just thought the thing would be the same,no cause i already knew but but the permoneter so i just what the thing would be the saing
1349,you are absolutely positively right,you are absolutely positively wright
1350,um it goes down like you just showed me or low low low low yes that was really cool,um it goes down like you just show me or elo  well yeah that as vey coal
1351,me i thought it was really cool,o mean i fough it was re ecool
1352,inside the tube is really water with green food coloring but then it goes up with hot water down with cold yes,incide tubes ery water with green food cooring but then it goes up with hot water down with cold yes
1353,yes,yes
1354,um when you wanna know what temperature will be outside so you can know how to dress,um when you wan know what temperature will be outside so you can know how to dress
1355,thank you,thank you
1356,that too,that two
1357,marnie this is jackie can you say something please,marnie this is jacke can you say something please
1358,well soil absorbs water gravel lets it go through but sometimes um gravel um gets wet by water that's most of the time what happens,well soa absorbs water gravel lets it go through but sometimes um gravel um gets wet by ler that's most of time what happens
1359,it has it kept some inside it and it let some out so that would basically double the mass the normal mass,it had it kept sem inside it and it wets them out so that would basically duble the mass the normal mass
1360,the water to the soil the soil absorbed the water,the water to te sord soil absorbed the water
1361,it's about um how the soil can absorb but a lot but the um gravel can absorb very little,t's about um how the soil can observe but a lots but the um gravel can absorb very little
1362,comes from us experimenting in the class,it comes from us experimentin in the class
1363,i see two triangular things they're kind of like um cones one is soil and one is gravel,i see two trangular things they're kind o like um cones one is soil and one is gravel
1364,we've been um we've been doing stuff with gravel and soil,we've been um we've been doing stuff with gravel and soil
1365,good thank you,good thank you
1366,thank you,thank you
1367,originally i think they came from um well soil came from dirt which god invented and um same thing with gravel except gravel did not come from dirt,we jn knowly i thinke it came from um well soia came from dirt which got ind pentin and um same ting if graph bocxause it gravel did not come from dirt
1368,well um soil can hold more water cause it absorbs it but gravel can hold less water because it does not absorb it,well um so you can hold more water cause it absorbs it but gravel can hold ress water because it does not absorb it
1369,i watered the gravel the water just went through,had water to gravel nd the water just went through
1370,well sometimes the earth material absorbs sometimes the water can go through,wl sometimes the ormat absorbs sometimes the water can go through
1371,well um it is shorter than the gravel because the soil absorbs the gravel does not cause the gravel is solid the soil is very very soft,well um it is shorter than the gravel because the soil absorbs the gravel is that cause the gravel is solid the soil is very very soft
1372,that um the um gravel absorbed actually ten milliliters,that um the um gravel absorbed dactualy ten milliliters
1373,to um complete further experiments with better experience,put it to um complete farther experiments with better experients
1374,well most of it went through and um some of it stayed on the rocks to like make the rocks wet wet and yeah the rest went through,well most of it went through and um some of it stayed on the rocks to like make they rocks wet wet and yeah the wrest went through
1375,the amount of water that drained through the gravel was less than the it was more than the soil because the soil absorbs the gravel does not,the amount of water that dringd food to gravel was less than he was more than the soil because the soil absorbs the gravel does not
1376,well the water drainage of the rocks really doesn't make them that heavy because they're already heavy and it did not absorb,wel the water drinage of the rocks rer doesn't make them that heavy because theyr are rely heavy and they do not absorb
1377,you put it on gravel and it goes through it go it doesn't absorb anything,you putit on gravel air it goes through itcause it doesn't absorb anything
1378,the hot water is less dense that is what it tells me,the hot water is west dense that is what it tells me
1379,um i would say it goes up or north and because the water pushes it up and that shows it's less dense,um i would say it goes up or north and because the water pushes it up and that shows it's west dense
1380,they float cause they have less density than the water,they float cause they have less density than the water
1381,we've been doing water and today we saw things float and sink actually didn't but we put hot water and cold water and hot water went to the top cold water went to the bottom cause they put food coloring in,we've been doing water intoday we saw things float and think after we didn't but we put hot wante and cold water and a hot wat or went tro isup coldoa went to the bttom cuse we bot food coloring tit
1382,good bye marnie,goodbye marnie
1383,um it is less dense,um it is restdene
1384,thank you,thank you
1385,um it's about the density of the cold water compared to the density of the room temperature water,um it's about the density of the cold water compared to the density of the room temperature water
1386,some of them will float some of them would not that's what what we were trying to do actually we were just doing hot water cold water,some of them  foap some of them were not that's what what we were trying to do actuall we're just doing ha at of cold water
1387,um that they are more dense than the water,um that they are more densed than tewater
1388,um it told me that the cold the cork um was less dense than the water which i did not know,um it told me that the ca the cork um was vess densed than the water which i did not know
1389,the cold water um the cold water is um in there and the cold water is actually more dense so it is floating to the bottom and can going all around too,the cold water um the cold water is um in there and the cold water's actually more dense o thes fiteen to the buttom and cain going all around too
1390,well they're all about density and which ones are less dense and more dense,well the're all about density and which one's have westemse and more denssee
1391,m that um not all of a lot of the red water floated to the top but not all of it be you have to even a vial kind of floated to the top when it was done,that um not all of a w of the red water forted to drop but not all of it be you hae actually even a vial kind of forted to the top when it was dum
1392,um it sinks and it sometimes also goes down and spreads,um it sinks and it sometimes also goes down and speds
1393,it means to have the things float instead of means um like they will sink cause they're more dense than the water,it means to'e have to think float instead of monce means um like they will sink cause they're more densed in water
1394,uh um hot water was more dense i mean less dense than the cold i mean than the room temperature water,um  hot the water was more dense i mean ress dense than the cold i mean in ta room temperature water
1395,they are both less dense and they are both both have the same density,they are both less dense and they are both boh oe the same density
1396,that they um would that they are lighter than that they are lighter than the uh less dense than the water,the day um wood that day are white ter than the they're wighter than the a wesst dense than the water
1397,true,dreaw
1398,it is about um how cold water is more dense than room temperature water yeah cold water is more dense than room temperature water,it is about um how cold water is more dense than inroom temperature water yeah cold water's more dense than room temperature water
1399,um they um they are sinking because they are more dense than the water,um they um they are sinking because they are more dense then the water
1400,the red water is floating out of the vial because it is less dense therefore it floats to the top why can't,the red water is flating out of the vial because it is westense therefore it fats to the top i ge
1401,a good thank you,good thank you
1402,they stay on the bottom of the cup because um they um are more dense than the water so yeah it all is um it all somehow connects to density,thace it on the bottom of the cup because um they um ar more dense an the water so yeah it all is um it alle some how connects to density
1403,it's exposed to air which co which is evaporating it,'s exposed to air which cwhich is evaporating it
1404,the hot air,de hot air
1405,in the wider cup cause it has more it has a more of a way to evaporate,in ha wider cup cause it has more it has a mor of a way to evaporate
1406,yes,yes
1407,um how big or round the surface area is,um how big or round the surface air yea is
1408,well uh yeah they all lost half as i thought,wellh oh they're they all last half as i thought
1409,go good thank you,good good thank you
1410,b is one hundred but c but a is sixteen but there still the same amount of water,well um you can rol over them and you can see that d is two hundred square centimeters c is twenty four
1411,um they are all um yeah they all uh they all have the same amount of water just in different cases,um they're all um yeah theyr all um they all have the same amount of water thr just in different cases
1412,the water on the surface is touching um the side of the container,the water on the surface is touching um the side of the container
1413,each one loses half,each one movses half
1414,this area is the area of the water,thi aa is the avea of the water
1415,um i've been um doing evaporation and today was the second day of where we put stuff in places like the refrigerator the ceiling the window sill the cortec computer,um i've been um through an evaporation and t' today was e second day of where we put stuff in places like the refrigerator de slind the windo csyda court to computer
1416,it's about how wide the thing is it was just half because it's so wide and available to be evaporated,it's about how wide the thring is it wases half because it's a wide and avariable to be evaporated
1417,two hundred square centimeters,two undred squre centimeters
1418,well the hotter the room and the wider the surface area the more is evaporating,well 'tho hotter the room and the wider the surfacariea the more is evaporated
1419,good thank you,good thank you
1420,t the paper towel got wet and soon the water was gone but you could see that it had taken the water into its material,the with the paper towel got wet and soon the water was goin but you could see that it had taken he water into its material
1421,um we've been learning about water and um doing lots of fun experiments and and we've played with normal and soapy and even salt water,um we've been learning about water and um doing lots of fun experiments an and we've pwied with normal and soapy and even salt water
1422,just a spot of water but if um but as it i put more drops and it looked started to look like a dome,just e spot of water but it's um but as it i put more drops when it will started to look like a dome
1423,yes it was really interesting to do that and learn all about the and you learned some about water that i didn't even know,yes it was really interesting to do that and learn all about the wered some about water that i didn't even know
1424,you have to tilt the paper and sometimes it doesn't work eventually if you tilt it enough it does,you have to ti the paper and sometimes it doesn't work but eventaly if you to to enough it does
1425,thank you you are very kind,thank you youre very kind
1426,because the all the um drops of water i think they go together and just they make that shape and cause it's a certain material it doesn't just fall flat,because they all the um drops of water i think they go together and just they make that shape and cause it's serta material it doesn't just fall fat
1427,water tension is the thing that makes it shape like anything it wants to be like,what attension is the thing that makes it shape like anything it wants to be like
1428,it i meant by like what as when you put in more drops on the um soapy water it can hold less than a penny can hold with normal water,it i ment by like  w as when you put more drops on te um soapy water it can hold wrest than a penny can hold with normal water
1429,it looks like a tear drop,it looks like a tea drop
1430,so the puddle was so cool it was just like a dome which i believe is the scientific term for something,so the peddle was so col it was just like a dome which a bub wheabe is a scientific term for something
1431,bye she's,bye she's
1432,good thank you,good thank you
1433,it goes up into the air,it goes up into the air
1434,um oh wait sorry i,uh please repeat o wait sorry i
1435,m cold cold water,in cold cold water
1436,well um in one it's cold water which causes surface tension to break and uh water vapor to be seen then eventually goes up to air and turns into what it was,well um and when it's called water which called a survauce atention to break in a water vapor to be seen then or then she goes up the r and turns into what it was
1437,well we've been doing condensation and evapora and then mostly condensation but a little bit of evaporation,well we've been doing condensation and evapor a and then most condensation but a little bit of evaporation
1438,um well some thing's that evaporate are water and water hot water cold water any kind of water,l um well somethings that evaporate are water and water hot water cold water any kind of water
1439,all about the wind carrying the water in the air to different places,all about the winds carrying the water in the air it's a different places
1440,like a big lake or yeah big lake and wet,like a big lake or you have big lake and wet
1441,k people make condensation chambers to see if condensation happens in the chamber,look people make condensation chambers to see if condensation happens in theur chamber
1442,um water evaporates and hot water and cold water evaporates too well that's still water but yeah,um water evaporates and hot water and cold water evaporates to or as the water but yeah
1443,t true,trou
1444,air,air
1445,true,troug
1446,water droplets form at whatever part has space they get separated into little little little ones make really big a really big one,water drop wat's form at whatever apart has space they conseparate into little litle little ones migkhte really bit a verly big one
1447,good,good
1448,um it's kind of like the vapor version of water,um it's kind af like the vapversion of water
1449,eleven twenty four see one one two four connection lost press okay and wait for marnie okay,wt i thik all about how the water vaper snaked in and now you can see wat apo wi a bubbles of air wot look like air anyway
1450,true,trou
1451,well condensation,a condensation
1452,um it's like little circles but when it goes on the hot surface you can actually see it and when you touch it it becomes little droplets like little rain drops tears that kind of thing,um it's like widdow circles but when it goes in hotvouse you can lectually see it and when you touch it it becomes swittow drop what's like whit rain drops ters like kind o thing
1453,um it was about seeing if condensation happened in the chamber,um it was about seeing if consr and happened in the chamber as ready
1454,hello my um,hell well marni um a
1455,yeah well it's not that loud,yeah well it's not that aloud
1456,mmm they attract to any piece with well it depends with any piece with iron if they have iron in it because there's a minus and a plus side,m they attract to any piece with well it depends with any piece with iron if they have iron in because there's a minus and a plus side
1457,yeah and it's a lot of com it's pretty complicated,yeah and it's a lot of c it's pretty complicated
1458,the it it doesn't work doesn't it it just doesn't do anything it just stays where it is,the it it doesn't work doesn't it it just doesn't do anything t just stays where it is
1459,the switch i just have to hit it,the switch i just have to hit it
1460,cause we don't have strong enough batteries we just use d cell batteries,cause we don't have strong enough batteries we just used de cell batteries
1461,just that the power was stronger and,just that the power is stronger an
1462,they just push it forward but there's like this magnetic field in it that's blocking it and just pushing it out but then when you clamp it just and then you let go it just flies out,they just push it ford but there's like this magnetc field in it that's blocking it just pushing it out but then  mi one clamp it just and then you let go just flies out
1463,a the repelling,uh they repelling
1464,y y if one of it has iron in it yes,if one of it has iron in it yes
1465,then the electricity is broken a circuit,theren the electricity is broken acircuit
1466,mmm yeah,yeah
1467,um the battery was just giving the electricity and power for it to flow through and then yeah do it make a circuit and then make also a magnet at the same time,um the battery was jus giving the electricity an power for it to flow through and then yeah do it make a circuit and then it make also a magnet at the same time
1468,um if you turned it well the switch can actually telegraph the thing you have to take the um switch and hit it against the metal part,um if you turned it u well the switch to actually telograph the thing you have to take tet um switch and hit it against the metal part
1469,magnetic f magnetic force uh i it um if the nother magnet then you can attach like not just be attracted and,magnetic magnetic force u it um if there's another magnet then you can attach like to ol just to be attracted and
1470,uh just like one centimeter away from you,uh just like one centimeter away from you
1471,it would like from far away like if you put the metal bar far away then it will con still do it and then you can show how how strong it is,it like from far away of like if you put the metal bar far away then itl can  still do it and then you can show how how strong it is
1472,it's a pathway for electricity,it's a pathway for electricity
1473,a,u
1474,so so when you kept hitting the thing with the bar that on the switch then the there's this bar here that was hitting on the rivet,so so when you kept hitting the thing with the bar that um the switch then the there 'as the sbar here that was hitting um the rivet
1475,yeah,yeah
1476,then it hits it but then it sticks so that's why you have to hit it back and forth really quick,them it hits it but then it sticks so that's why you have to hit it back and forth reall quik
1477,paper well paper clips do work but paper clips and paper clips don't stick together,paper well paper clips do work but paper clips and paper clips don't stick together
1478,they're inside the wires the electricity is flowing,they're inside the wires the electricity is flowing
1479,me maybe possibly yeah,maybe possibly yeah
1480,no,no
1481,th they would just being used,h they were just being used
1482,it makes the bar hit against the rivet,it makes the bar hit against the rivet
1483,yeah,yeah
1484,yeah it's a magnet but the magnet was used to also make um the talking clicks,yeah it's a magnet but the magnet was used to also make um they're talking clicks
1485,north and north won't attract south and south won't attract i think,north and north won't attract south and south won't attract i think
1486,the electricity did something to it,the electricity did something doing
1487,yeah yeah,yeah yeah
1488,well with other experience we did it,well with the other experiencs we did it
1489,yeah the electricity was f fing jumping,yeah the electricity was i thing jumping
1490,um south and north would attract,um south and north would attract
1491,yep,yep
1492,do,two
1493,yep,yep
1494,you couldn't it just screw it just just ricochets off it it doesn't stay,you couldn' just go i it just just wicke shas off it doesn't stay
1495,in five wires,in five wires
1496,yeah,yeah
1497,yeah but it also worked as a telegraph thing,yeah but it also worked as a tila graph thing
1498,uh nope,ui nop
1499,yeah so it just cutting the circuit,yeah so iy'e just cutting the circuit
1500,the negative and the a uwe well we should just say north and south,the negative and the and w whalt we should just say north and south
1501,yeah,yeah
1502,i just felt it as i don't know just more electricity and,i just felt it as i don't know just more electricity and

1511,uh we had a group and the we talked within each other,uh we had a group  and then we talked with in each other
1512,no we all used the same thing,no we all use the same thing
1513,you can do a manual one which you just take th the button and then just flick it and just ca e ca do the clicking thing,you can do a manual one which you just take the hthe bun then just flick it and there's ca and c they're thea clicking thing
1514,it would be a lot more powerful,it wuld be a lot more powerful
1515,the electromag yeah,the electro yeah
1516,the bar iron some sort of metal that magnets like and that stuff that attract like,the ba iron some sort of metal that magnet t's like and that stuff that attract like
1517,the but what the problem is is that we only had just three wires so we can't use three wires to a to attach two batteries to the switch,the but what the probblem iss that we only had just three wires so we can't use three wires to ad to attach two batteries to the switch
1518,the plus side is the positive and the minus side is the negative side,the plus side is the positive and the minus side is the negative ten
1519,mmm yes because if the positive side does not touch the bottom and the negative side doesn't touch the side it it won't turn on,yes because if the positive side doesnot touch the bottom and the negative side doesn't touch the side i it won't turn on
1520,okay,okay
1521,after that the the light bulb lights up,after that the the light bulb lights up

1523,yes,yes
1524,yes they're important,yes they're important
1525,i think it's about the just both sides have to touch the light bulb some,i think it's about the just both sides have to touch the light bulb someway
1526,you can use two wires and connect each wire to one of the sides to the negative and positive and connect both wires to the light bulb,you can use two wires and connect each wire to one in the side to the negative positive and connect both wires to the light bulb
1527,the wires and the battery didn't light the light bulb because because they weren't in the right places,the wires and the battery didn't light the light bulb because because they were in the right places
1528,yes it didn't light the light bulb,yes it didn't light the light bulb
1529,they're important because without the negative or positive side the light bulb can't light light up,they're important because without the negative or positive side the light bulb can light light up

1537,the other picture the pathways there was two pathways and in this one there is two other pathways,in the other picture in there pathways there was two pathways and in this one there's two other pathway
1538,mmm some type of circuits circuits only have one way for the electricity to flow through and some of the ones have two ways or more,some type of circuit i circuits only have one way for the electricity to flow through and some other ones have two ways or more
1539,in the other picture the energy of the battery was going to two different to two different light bulbs,in the other picture  the r o the bettery was going to two different  to two different light bulbs
1540,yes we did,yes we did
1541,and the flow always um always goes right back to the battery,that the flow always am rbers goes right back to the battery
1542,no,no

2478,i'm going to need help talking,it was basically just like
2479,good,good
2480,is very good uh could you be a little more pacific,is very go uh could you be little more specific
2481,bye bye bye ba ba bye bye bye,bye bye b bye bye bye bye
2482,and well i need help hi,because it's basically just doing something different like if i click on this it'll do something like if i get on the magnet
2483,if you have a magnet right here on this piece on the big piece of paper and a magnet right here on the thin piece of paper and a pencil right here it won't be strong enough to pull towards this with a pencil behind it,if you have a magnet right here on this piece on the big piece of paper and a magnet right here on the then piece of paper and a pencil right here it won't be strong enough to pull towards this with ha pencil behind it
2484,the force okay,the force okay
2485,well the nail has a magneta field around it so if you put the magnet on it and push it down it's like the magnet will stick to the paper clip always,well the nail has a magnec field around it so if you put the magnet on it and push it down it's like the magnet will stick to the paper clip always
2486,it's basically just it's basically the paper clip is always gonna be magnetized rather what you do it's going to be magnetized but if you have something too thick the magnet won't stick to the paper clip,it's basically just it's basically the paper clip is always gonn be magnetized rather what you do it's gonna be magnetized but if you have tsomething too thick the magnet will stick to the paper clip
2487,the nail isn't forcing the paper clip up to it because the magnet's off it and also the force is off it so the magnet still has a force and abserbed it like it up,the nail ist force eeing the paper clip up to it because the magnet's off it and also the force is off it so the magnet still has the force ant absorbed it like swelled it up
2488,well mostly i've been like just trying to discover what else is magnets by rubbing a magnet on something that's not magnetized and it worked,well mostly i've been like just trying to discover what else is magnets by rubbing a magnet on something that's not magnetized and it worked
2489,because of the force is forcing it to stick together,because o the force is forcing it to stick together
2490,okay so it's the gravity it's called a force and if it doesn't stick that's forcing it away from it,okay so it's i the gravity it's called a force and if it doesn't stick that's forcing it away from it
2491,the nail won't pick up the paper clip because it's not magnetized yet,the nail won't pick up the paper clip because it's not magnetized yet
2492,the nail isn't picking up the paper clip because the force is always in the magnet,the nail isn't picking up the paper clip because the force is always in the magnet
2493,netism basically is very very important,neti is only basically it's very very important
2494,cause the nail is getting the magnetic force from the magnet so for instance if you kept doing it it will make the paper clip stick,cause the nail is getting the magnetic force from the magnet so for instance if you kept doing it it will make the paper clip stick
2495,it's called a show flow,t' called a shiallflow
2496,everything will drop because most of the rings are getting stuck from the magnet,everything will drop because most of the rings are getting stuck from the magnet
2497,the rivet is um surrounded by all the wires that are tying it up,the rivet is um surrounded by all the wires that are tighing it up
2498,okay okay can we just move onto another thing,okay okay cond we just move on to another thing
2499,because all the energy flows around and around and around and around the rivet and goes back into the battery and does it again,because all the energy flows amounting round andaround around the rivet and goes back trough the battery and does it again
2500,cause if the switch is closed that means the circuit works cause it's an electromagnet,cause if the switch is closed that means the circuit works cause it's an electromagnet
2501,everything will fly up,everything will fly up
2502,clo ho hose,cloh oho

2644,if the water's too rough the boat could tip over but if it's calm it'll be easier to put the pennies and it'll stay up,if the water's too ruft the boat can tip over but if it's calm itll be easier t but the pennies then itw'll stay up
2645,then we um we would know how much water it would hold,in the boat and see how much it could hold and um if when it wants to go up went over or it' sothin then we
2646,the s the smaller ones well the smaller one won't hold as much and the biggers one will,the  the smaller ones will the smaller one won't hold as much and the bigger as one will

2649,the um the cap,that um we
2650,thank you,thank you
2651,f you drop them in it might not hold as much but if you set em in and you keep them even it'll hold more,you dropp them in it might not hold as much but if you set tem in and you keep hem eaven it'll hold more
2652,we made four different sizes to see um which one would,we made four different sizes to see um which one would
2653,if you like put them on one side it would sink over if you balance em it might ha be able to hold more,if you like put them on one side it would sink over if you balance them it might have be able to hold more
2654,they're about when we're trying to see um w how many pennies can fit into it without it sinking and um,and how much water it can go over can it can fip  before it goes over
2655,if you change too many,if you change too many

2658,if you don't use accurate measurements then it could um let's say you do one that's eight centi,if you don't use accurate measurements then it could um let's say you do one that's eat centimt
2659,um there we designed them to hold pennies and to hold a certain amount of water and to see how um much water they could hold,um they're we desined them to hold pennies and to hold a certain amount of water and to see how um much water they could hold
2660,okay i'm not sure on this one,okay i'm not sure on this one
2661,if the water is like ha it's really tall waves it'll knock em over but if it's calm and kind of flat and just sitting there then it'll be easier to stack them,if the water is like how s really tall was it will not come over but if it's coman kind of flat and just sitting there then it'll be easier to stack them
2662,if you only change if you change one variable at a time it will be easier to see if you're doing it right or wrong,if you only change if you change one variable at a time yitw'll be easier to see if you're doing it right or wrong
2663,that if you stack em it will stay evenly and that it could hold more and if you just kind of put them all over the place it doesn't really work that well without sinking,that if you stack tem it 'll stay evenly and then it could hold more and if you just kinda put them all over the place it doesn't really work that wal without sinking
2664,you're only stacking on one side and if you stack em on one side it's gonna sink if you stack em in the middle like the one on the left it'll stay up longer,you're only stacking one one side and if you tack em on one side it's gonna sink if you stuck um in the middle like the one on the left it'll stay up longer
2665,if let's see um we're,if let's see um we
2666,i can't i'm not sure,i can't i'm not sure u
2667,to see which one would work better if the smaller one or the medium sized one or the bigger one and so we could just choose different kinds and see what the results are for different ones,to see which one would work better if the smaller one or the medium sized one or the bigger one and so we could just chose different kinds and see what the results are for different ones
2668,that the smaller one might hold less amount of pennies and then the medium will hold a little more and a little more and a little more,that the smaller one might hold less amount of pennies and then the medium wil hold a little more and a little more and a little mork
2669,if you only change one thing at a time it might be easier to see if that thing made it worse or better,if you only change one thing at a time it might be easier to see if that thing made it worse or better
2670,if you set them down it might be easier to put more in if you kind a just drop em in it might you know make it sink,if you set them down it might be easier to put more in if you kinda just drop hem in it might gonna make it sink
2671,um let's see if w,um let's see if wai
2672,at one time you could,s at one time you could
2673,if they're smaller then it'll be harder to put more pennies in and if they're bigger it'll be easier since they're taller and you can put more pennies in without it sinking,if they're smaller then it 'll be harder to put more pennies in and if they'reare bigger it'll be easier since they're taller and you can put more pennies in without its sinking
2674,if you put them in the middle they'll be able to have more since it's balanced and if you put them kinda everywhere it'll sink faster,if you put them in the middle they'll be able to have more since it's balanced and if you put them kind a everywhere it'll sink faster
2675,um the smaller ones might not as hold as much pennies because they're not as taller and it'll overflow faster,um the smaller ones might not as hold as much pennies because they're not as taller and it will overflow faster
2676,know if they're wrong or right,o if they were wrong right
2677,you should stop there because if you put any more in you'll probably overflow the boat,you should stop there because if you put any more and you'll probably overfilw the boat
2678,if you would let's see um,if you would say um
2679,with string and then the other one's supposed to be eight too but if you do one that's accidentally nine it'll end up being a little different,s long the string and then the other ones supposed to be eight two but if you do one that's accidentally nine it'll end up being a little different
2680,um it was important to make sure there's different sizes and if they weren't different sizes they would just carry the same amount of water and pennies,um it was important to make sure there's different sizes and if they weren't different sizes they would just carry the same amount of water and pennies
2681,well you should um,well you should um
2682,like you could have if you added too many things you,like you could have if you added too many things you'
2683,how much how tall the boat was and how wide it was,how muh how tall the boat was and how wide it was
2684,once the boat sunk you took one penny out and then counted how many pennies you have left and see that's how many passengers your boat can hold,once ha boat sunk you took one ptenny i and then counted how many pennies you have left and see that's how many passengers your boat can hold
2685,when the boat,when the boat
2686,that the difference if they're wider or taller they'll will hold more water and more pennies,that the difference if they're wider or taller they'l will hold more water and more pennies
2687,the one that's under water has too many pennies because they're all piled up and they're spread out but the one um that's still above is even and it'll be easier,the one that's underwater has to many pennies because they're all piled up and they're spread out but the one um that's still above is even and itw'll be easier
2688,cause if they were the same then you don't even know if you know other kinds would work better or work less,cause if they were the same then you do't wouldn't know if you know other kinds would work better or work less
2689,well the smaller one might be um might not as m,well the smaller one might be um might not as
2690,if the boat is smaller it'll be harder to put the pennies in since if it had more pressure and weight on it and it's not as tall and it'll sink with more less pennies,if the boat is smaller tw'll be harder to put the pennies in since if uh had more pressure and weight on it nd it's not as tall and it'll sink with more less pennies
2691,u,
2692,this week in science we've been working on the capacity of boats with little paper cups and we've been seeing how much water they can hold and how much pennies they can hold,this week in science we've been working on the capacity of boats well little paper cups and we've been seeing how much water they can hold and how much pennies they can hold
2693,cause it depends how you put the pennies in if you kind of drop em in they might be less if you set em in it might be easier if you put em on one side it might be harder to do that and if you stack em evenly it might have more,cause it depends how you put the pennies in if you kinda drop them ien they might be less if you centimin it might be easier if you put em on one side it might be harder to do that and if you stack m even light it might have more
2694,bye,bye
2695,yeah we'll probably try out and launch those tommorow,yeah it will probably try out and lench ttheos tomorow
2696,well the um the straws hold up and the stick holds the rubber band and the propeller and the straws hold up the whole plane,well the um the straws hold up and the stick holds a rubber band and the propeller and the straws hold up the whole plane
2697,a i'm not sure since we haven't learned much about this,a i'm not sure since we haven't learned much about this

2699,well that's pretty much what we did so far and we're going to start um making this actually making it tomorrow,well that's pretty much whatwe did sso far ind we're gonna start um making the factually making it tomorow
2700,yep,yep
2701,well we um spinned the propeller like twenty five times and we added two paper clips each time to see how far it went with more paper clips,well we um sbend the propeller like twenty five times and we added two paper clipss each time to see how far it went wwith more paper clips
2702,can i see a picture of,can i ee a picture of
2703,yeah the rubber band,eah the  rubber band
2704,um probably the flipper base and the um stick that holds it up and the rubber stop,um probably the flipper base and the um stick that holds it up and the rubber stop
2705,well we could instead of a cork we could like use a ball of tin foil like mister suggested or we could use something heavier and that might affect how far it goes,well we could instead of a cork we could like use a ball of ten foil like miss rin a suggested or we could use something heavier and that might affect how far it goes
2706,hi,hi
2707,we'll probably make either a graph or we'll probably make a chart,witll probably make either a graph or will probably make a chart
2708,yep the weight may um affect how far it goes,yep the weight might um affect how far it goes
2709,can you show me a picture of the flipper,can you show me a picture of the flipper
2710,that they all have a different purpose the cork is what we're gonna launch and then the rubber stopper helps it um stay up and then,that they all have a different perpoce the cork is what we're gong ta lounch and then the rubber stopper helps it um stay up and then
2711,well we're gonna put a cork and then we're gonna launch it at different heights and see how far it'll go,well we're gonn put a cork  and then were goni lunch at at different heights and see how far it will go
2712,hold on,um you can use the flipper beace to um set up the um the
2713,yep,yep
2714,we've been making predictions and questions on the flipper and the launcher of the flipper,we've been making predictions and questions on the flipper and the loncher of the flipper
2715,stick is um holding it up and the flipper base is how we hold it up and launch it,lip stick is um holding it up  the flipper base is helping hold it up and thech it
2716,um we could see how it could when we spin it how far it could go,um we could see how it could when we spin it how far it could go
2717,well,well
2718,the straws tried to h to hold up the string and the popsicle sticks we narrowed it down so it would fit in to those little things that hold the rubber band and their propeller and that's how it works,the straws trye to  t hold up the string and the popsicle sticks  we neared it down so it wou'd fit into those little things that hold the rubber be in  ther pompeller and that's how it works
2719,well the one on the bottom's not as straight as the one on top up and i think that if the one on the top's straighter it'll be easier for it to fly but at the one at an angle it might be harder for,well the one on the bottom's not as straight as the one top and i think that if the one on the top straight or it'll be easier for it to fly but at the one a the angle it might be hardy for
2720,we used popsicle sticks and a propeller and straws and then were we were spinning the propeller twenty five times to see it how far it could get down the string,we used popsicle sticks and a propeller and straws and then  we were spinning the propeller twenty five times to see ick how far it could get down the string
2721,effects how much it can fly,t effects how much it can fly
2722,is that you you have the propeller and something that holds the propeller up and then you have,is that you you have the propeller and something that holds a propeller up and then you hl
2723,well me and my partner we put our string at an angle and we learned that if you put it at an angle it,well mean my partner we put our string at a angle and we learned that if you put it atn an angle it'
2724,body of it and then you have something that holds it up and makes it fly,body of it and then you have something that holds it up and makes it fly
2725,peller up so we could se,peler up so we could s
2726,well flight line hold,well  lin hold
2727,bye thank you,bye thank you
2728,they they held up the um propeller and it helped to spin it and it kept it from falling down and it helped a lot,they they held up the um propeller and it helped to spin it and i keped it from falling down and it helped a lot
2729,good,good
2730,and making planes with straws on a propeller and we took the string and tied it to two chairs and wind up the propeller and see how far it could get,en making planes with straws un a propeller and we took the string intite it to two chairs and wind up the propeller and see how far it could get
2731,what makes a propeller so,it makes up a planc
2732,well you need to think about how far you should spread apart your straws and what kind of string you should use and how many times you uh wind up the propeller,well you need to think about how far you should spead part your straws and what kind of streng you should use and how many times you uh wind up the propeller
2733,hello,hello
2734,what's important is the body the propeller and what the string and what's holding it up,what's important is the body the propeller and what the string and what's holding it up
2735,well how how big the boat is and how tall it is affects how much passengers it can hold,well how how big the boat is and how tall it is affects how much passengers it can hold
2736,we've been making paper boats and seeing the capacity and how much passengers they can hold and we've been doing graphs,we've been making pape r boats and seeing the capacity and how much passengers they can hold and we've been doing graphs
2737,well it depends of the size of the boat how much it can hold and how much you would be able to estimate how much you can it could hold,well it depends on the size of the boat how much it can hold and how much you would be able to estimate how much you can it could hold
2738,if you change too many at one time then you won't know if you got it right at the beginning or that you had too many change or you had just right amount of change,if you changed too many at one time then you won't know if you got it right at the beginning or that you had too many change or you had just right amount o change
2739,well the you can you can find that maybe one it like one boat can hold more passengers th and one can hold less but it depends on the size,well that you can you can find that maybe one it like one boat can hold more passengers  and one can hold less but it depends on the size
2740,the higher it gets the more passengers it gets and more capacity it can get,the higher it gets the more passengers it gets in  more capacity it can get
2741,what we did here is we we found one,what we did here is we we found
2742,um if you change one variable then the other if it works better or less then you don't have to change the other variable so you only ch so change one at a time,um if you change one variable than the other if it works better or less then you don't have to change a other variable so you only sh so i change one at a time
2743,we were in charge of seeing how much capacity it can hold and how much pennies we can hold and we did four different sizes of boats so we could see what the difference was,we were incharge of seeing how much capacity it can hold and how much pennies we can hold and we did four different sizes a boat so we could see what the difference was
2744,well on the bottom of the graph is how much the number of passenger no yeah is the number of passengers that it can,well on the bottom of the graph is how much the number of passenger no yeah is the number of passengers that i can
2745,well the s smaller the boat is the less passengers it can hold,well the ssmaller the boat is the less passengers it can hold
2746,good,good
2747,kay yeah,ay yeah
2748,well we,well we
2749,that as the capacity gets higher so does the number of passengers,that as the capacity gets higher so it does the number of passengers
2750,well on the bottom is uh how much capacity it can hold and the passengers and then,is usually the capacity and the passengers usually stay aroind the same amount and they really don't have some big difference in between
2751,well we put down how much capacity until we get to the highest number and how much the passengers until we got,well we put down how much capacity until we get to the highest number and how much the passengers until we goto
2752,well they're putting em in the middle so it can hold more but if you put em all to the side it'll tip over um with less amount in pennies than it actually can hold,well they're putting hem in the middle so it can hold more but if you put em ol to the side it'll tip over um with less amount and pendies than it actuallyo can hold
2753,the different size of the cup depends how much capacity it can hold and how many passengers it can hold,the different size of the cup depends how much capacity it can hold and how many passengers it can hold
2754,we,we
2755,well we did four different sizes so that we could tell which one could hold more and which one could hold less,well we did four different sizes so that we could help which one could hold more and which one could hold less
2756,alright so let's see,i okay so let's see yu
2757,that the more capacity it can hold the more passengers,that the more capacity it can hold the more passengers
2758,we did four different sizes of boats so we could tell which so if we did all four the same we wouldn't know if different sizes could hold more or less,we did for different size of the boat so we could tell which so if we did all for the same we wouldn't know if different sizes could hold more or less
2759,you well that the more if you look at the pattern the more the capacity is the passengers always less the capacity it can hold,but that
2760,it's how capacity is how much water it can hold,it's o capacity is how much water it can hold
2761,it shows you what where the where the the capacity and the passengers meet up on the graph,it shows you what where the where the the capacity and the passengers meat up on the graph
2762,uh um they're and uh um x and the y are matched up so they're pretty much the same,tha um they're boths the  me things and uh um x the y are matched up so they're pretty much the same
2763,well the more you add the passengers the distance will it it won't go as far,well the more you add the passengers the distance will an it won't go as far
2764,so you can um,so you can um
2765,hello oh my,hello
2766,okay bye,okay bye
2767,well we um listed the numbers of passengers and the distance and we realized that the more passengers you have the um it doesn't go as far,well we um listed the numbers of passengers an the distance and we reallized that the more passengers you have the um it doesn't go as far
2768,well it's um other side so it'll be easier to list,well it's placed like on the other sides it would be easier to lisst them
2769,we've been making pa we've been making planes and testing um them and seeing we've been changing some variables and seeing what it would do,we've been making pap we've been making pleans and testing um them and seeing we've been changing some variables and seeing what they would do
2770,the number of the numbers that it goes up to the number of passengers and the distance and how far that goes up to,the number of like ve  the numbers that it goes up to the number of passengers and the distance and how far that goes up to
2771,well you place the y there because it's on the line of the and then it'll be it'll be like right there so you it's easier,well you plase sot wy there because it's on the line of the red and then it'll be it'll be like rain there so  it's easier
2772,well x is number of motors or rubberbands and y is the distance,well x is number of motors a rubber bands and why is the distance
2773,it'll go pretty far,pands it'll go pretty far
2774,well we could change like how many rubberbands we had or put on some extra passengers or me and my partner made wings,well we could change like how many rubber bands we had or put on some xtor passengers or mean my partner made wings
2775,okay,oka
2776,well you can,well you can
2777,well um usually it doesn't matter but you have to like list like the number of passengers and the distance and it doesn't exactly matter what side you put it on though,well um usually it don't matter but you have to like west like the number of passengers of a distance and  does not exactly matter what side you put it on themh
2778,well that so we could tell which the difference is and it'll be easier to explain,well that so we could tell which to the difference s and it 'w'll be easier to explain
2779,and but he thought it was sixty two milligrams and he thought that it it was monster,and but he thought it was sixty two ilgrams y though that the it was a monster
2780,a hundred,a hundred
2781,a gram's about as much as a paper clip,up gram's about as much as a paper clip
2782,that there's a hundred grams there,that there's a hundred grams there
2783,milligram weighs as much as i don't know maybe a grain of sugar or a grain of salt maybe i don't know i don't really i'm not sure but,a milligramweigh is as much as i don't know maybe a green of sugar or a grean of salt maybe i don't know i don't really and then that's sure but
2784,um mmm let's see,um let's see
2785,okay,okay
2786,yeah let's see i wanna see the tips i wanna s look at the tips what does i mean,yeah let's see i wan na see the chips i wan na  look at the chips what does i mean
2787,i've been well i didn't know i think but on friday we we just heard about a gram we just heard about a gram like on friday,i've been well those i i didn't know i think u on friday we we just heard about a gram we just heard about a gram like on friday
2788,a hundred,a hundred
2789,okay,en
2790,yeah,yeah
2791,um like having it on there,um only like having at on there
2792,it was the interactive tips,i as the interactive clips
2793,i actually learned that from mother and father because i didn't learn any th uh i haven't learned that that much about grams from my teacher because well we,i actually learned that from a mother and father thingause i didn't learned any suh haven't learned that that much about grams for my teacher because well we
2794,no,no
2795,um that the net one of the beans equals a gram,um that the that one of the beans equals a gram
2796,and also i like x and i've also heard exograms my mother and father told me about that and also,and also i like x and i've also heard about x agrams my mother and father told me about that and also
2797,um twenty grams,um twenty grams

2809,um we would add one hundred if it wasn't enough,um we would add one hundred if it wasn't enough
2810,mmm you could hold it steady there no no oh um,you cou would hold it stady there no no mm ium
2811,mmm each side would weigh the same and it would be one line,each side would weigh the same and it would be one line
2812,milligram is a s thousandth of a gram with a thousandth of a gram,a milligram an there's thousands of a gram weighs a thousands of a gram
2813,a hundred beans equals,hundred beans equals

2820,we we can add more of that stuff,we we can add more of that stuff
2821,and we did weigh it with paper clips,and we did weight with paper clips
2822,wait,wait
2823,oh those things push out the water and it's wherever this little point is that's how much water is in there,well those things push out the water and it's wherever this little point is that's how much water is in there
2824,oh a hundred yeah a gram is equal to a hundred of those,oh a hundred yeah a gram is equal to a hundred of those
2825,one milliliter probably equals a millili a millimeter,one milliliter probably equals a millilit a millimeter

2878,before that looked like before sorry gr no not that one w did we do this one,before that looked like before us hury gr no not that one did we do this one
2879,well like well um because then some people say that it's this amount w of vials and some people say it's th a different amount,well like well um because then some people say that it's this amount  of vials and some people say it's a different amount
2880,um prob probably milliliters,um prob probably milliliters
2881,mmm that's a hundred that's a thousandth of it that's a tenth and that's tenth of it and that's a whole of it,that's a hundred that's a thousandhh of it that's a tenth and that's  tenth of it and that's a whole of it
2882,oh yeah those,oh yeah those
2883,what,what
2884,no no neither we haven't done it yet,no no neither we haven't done it yet
2885,um a hundred milliliters,um a hundred milliliters
2886,no let's s compare vials yeah that's like what ours were,no let's see compare vials  yeah h that's like what ours were
2887,mmm wha the what'd you say paying attention i was thinking about this thing,wha the whauh what d you say ereisn't pink demsiners then you mant this thing
2888,no no no a gram,no no no agram
2889,that like in the i'm th the thing about,that like in the unthe thing about
2890,yeah we used that thing,yeah we used that thing
2891,then for those you just pour it in for those you pour some you put water in those,and for those you just pour it in for those you pour some you put water in those u
2892,two hundred milliliter graduated cylinders equal what's that,two hundred milliliter graduated cylinders equal what's that
2893,yeah,yeah
2894,yeah,yeah h
2895,it's interactive or in soda look see it says orange soda,it's interactive or and soda likel i say ang soda
2896,that's two hundred milliliters but what what is it called is what i'm wondering oh a tray,that's two hundred milliliters but what what is it called is what it' onderng oh trey
2897,yeah,yeah
2898,mmm no no we have one cup and it has an a line a b line a c line a d line,hm no no we have one cup and it has an a line a b line an a c li ane a d line
2899,um how many oh that's a thousand in that big thing in one liter,um how many oh that's a thousa idn't that big thing and  one liter
2900,well because that's one's wide it's too flat and those two out it would be the same size as that,well because that one's wide if yo flat and those two out it would be the same size that
2901,what was the soda can the interactive soda can i like the interactive ones aw,who is the soda cand the interact iofe soda cannel i like the interact of ones h
2902,yeah that was a long time ago that was before winter break,yeah that was a long time ago that was before wenter break
2903,well by those things on the,well by those things on the
2904,well m l stands stands for milliliters and then the number in front of it that's how many milliliters it is,well m aalstounds stands for milliliters andthen the number in font of it that's how many milliliters it is
2905,yeah mmm well not well sort of that's sort of like what we did last time,yeah m well not well sort of that's sort of like what we did last time
2906,we what you do is you have to have you look at where the water's lined up and the one that the water is lined up to is the one that you're,y what you do is you have to have you look at where the water's lined up and the one that the water s lined up to as pon at yr
2907,but i wanna look at the int that's the only interactive thing though,but i wantna look at that int that's the only interactive thing abou oe
2908,milliliters are um are thousandths of a liter they're thousandths of a liter,milliliters are um are thousand of a liter they're thousands of a liter
2909,because the vials were different yeah s milliliters,because the vials were different yeah smilliliters
2910,uh huh but i wanna videotape my tonsils,but i wanno fo notate my tonsils
2911,milliliters,milliliters
2912,um fifty most of are graduated cylinders but those ones have a hundred,um fifty most of our graduated cylinders but those ones have a hundred
2913,and you pull water out of the you pull the water out of the cup and into the syringe and then you squirt it back in and then measure the amount of water that was in the cup with the syringe,an you pull water out of the up you pull the water out of the cup and into the syringeand then you squired it back in and then you measure the amount of water that was in the cup with the syringe
2914,uh the syringe is a is a thing that sorta sucks up water it's and then it tells you how much is in there that you sucked up,of the syringe is  is a thing it's soarte to sucks up water it's and then it tells you how much is in there that you sucked up
2915,and we weren't using vials we l used vials a long time ago,no we weren't using vials we used vials a long time ago
2916,wait how is that po pos i wanna look at that again i forgot how how is that possible oh yeah counting the top it was possible,wait how was that p possi i wanted look at that again i forgot how how was that possible oh yeah counting the top it was pos
2917,no but whoa a hundred millili that looks ne equals,no but well a hundred millili that looks neat equals
2918,it's the only interactive one,st ongly interactive ie
2919,one liter,one liter
2920,um um hmm not really,um um  not really
2921,um oh that one's really well that one is the same as that so that one weighs the same as that other one the middle one that we saw before in that thing and that was two hundred,um oh that one's really well that one is the same as that so that one was the same as that other one the middale one that we saw befoure in that thing and that was two hundred
2922,syringes yes you just ta i ju hey i just saw a syringe i just saw fifty and we also lews used fifty milliliter ones,syringe s yeah you just ha i this he i this sa syringe i thes sah fifty and we also losed used fifty milliliter ones
2923,maybe that's a wait but there's something a bit in inaccurate there they the it isn't exactly because look see that thing's the same amount wide as that oh it might be l longer that way,r but that's a wai but there's something about an interaccurate there they itdidn't it isn't exactly because look see that things the same amount why is that oh it might be longer that way
2924,yeah with no,yeah what's no
2925,um well because we wouldn't know if it was exactly two hundred milliliters,um well because you wouldn't know if it was exactly two hundred milliliters
2926,mmm oh yeah we measured our desk with straws,m oh yeah we measured our desk with straws
2927,um well,um well
2928,ten are in one ten millimeters are in one centimeter,ten are in one ten millimeters are in one centimeter
2929,those things marks centimeters okay,those things marks centimeters okay
2930,okay,okay
2931,um a meter is three point something feet,um a meter is three point something feet
2932,um it's a meter tape and you write your name there,um it's a meter tape and you'e what your nameis there
2933,mmm reading writing and math mainly,um reading wriding an math mainly
2934,a millimeter,one millimeter
2935,one ten millimeter equals one teeny centimeter,ine s ten millimeter equals one teeny send time
2936,by to yeah because to be a nine tenth is al i mean two and nine tenths is almost three,y two yeah because three and nine tenth is a i mean two and nine tenth i's almost three
2937,by to it because like most people desks were three by two but mine was two and nine tenths by two,y to it because like most people desks with three by two but mine was t an nine tenth by two
2938,no the it uh it isn't colored at all,no ti it d  it disn't colored at all
2939,because my desk seemed shorter than all the other ones at my table,because my desk semed tartand all the other ones at my table
2940,a centimeter is a hundredth of a meter it is a hundred and one meter going all the way,a centimeter is a hundredth of a meter there's a hundred and one meter going all the way i don't nike it
2941,maybe,maybe
2942,what a scale one millimeter,what is scale one millimeter
2943,oh well,uh well
2944,okay,okay
2945,mmm hmm okay,m hm okay
2946,no we just start we just started cutting it out and glued it together,no wed just start we just started counting it out to an glued it together
2947,i wanna see what else is there i don't wanna get,i want no see what else is there i don't wan no get rid of te
2948,no oh yeah we did we we did,no oh yeah we did we mills
2949,hi look that thing is going look that thing goes,hay lok that thing is going uh loks tats and goes oup
2950,no we already had rulers but we didn't use them we learned about the metric with meters and centimeters and all the oth and the rest of the world uses,no we already had rulers but we didn't use them we learned about the metric with meters and centimeters and all the othe i the rest of the world use it
2951,yeah probably,yeah probably
2952,nope not at all,nope not at all
2953,that's wha the red line is one centimeter one two three four five six seven eight nine ten of those,that's wha the red line is one centimeter one two three four six te and ten of those
2954,whoops aww,bs
2955,no,no
2956,yeah you might color it though i i have no idea we might color it sometime,yeah you might color it though i i have no idea or  might color it sometime

3860,i have been studying measurement,i have been studying measurement
3861,well if you use centimeters it's gonna be it's gonna be a lot smaller than it's gonna be with like straws because s most straws are bigger than centimeters,well if he se centimeters is gonna be it's gonna be a lot smaller than it is gonna be with like straws becuse mose straws are bigger thnhe centimeters
3862,a millimeter relates to a meter because i think it's um larger than it's like ten meters i'm not i think,a millimeter relates to a meter because i think it's um larger than it's like ten meters on what i think
3863,well the first time we did it y we used straws and we figured out that everybody's um measurement will be different because the straws were all different sizes,well the first time we did i't eat weas straws and we figured out that everybody's um measurement will be different becase the straws were all different sizes
3864,um you normally use meters when you want to measure something large not small like for example if you wanted measure the height of a whole door you'd use meters instead of centimeters or inches,um you new to use meterse when you want to measure something large not small like for example if you weant in measured the height of a hole door you'd use meters instead of centimeters or inches
3865,centimeter relates to a meter by because there are a hundred centimeters in a meter so a meter is actually just a hundred centimeters,a centimeter relates to a meter by because they're ale a hundred centimeters in a meter so a meter is actually just a hundred centimeters
3866,well i observed that it's um different um there's going to be a different length like you're gonna have a different number always no matter what,well i observed that it's um different um there's gong na be a different length like you can have a different number always no matter what
3867,you're trying to figure out how long it is or how wide it is,you  trind to figure out how long it is or how wide it is
3868,um well in one centimeter there are ten millimeters,um well in one centimeter there are ten millimeters
3869,um you can measure things um like with with um with millimeters you're gonna get a more precise answer than with centimeters,um wyou can measure things un like with with um with millimeters you're gonna get um more precise answer than with centimeters
3870,one thousand of them,one thousand of them
3871,uh measurement is when is when you see like how tall something is how wide something is or how long something is,um measurement is when is when you see like how tall something is how wide something is or how long something is

3877,well the dry sponge or the wet sponge so the the water the water is what makes is what makes the wet sponge heavier so that's why what i just told you works,well the dry sponge an the wet sponge so the the water the water is what makes is what makes the wet sponge heavier so that's why what it just told you works
3878,you um you use gra you put grams in the other side you put grams in the other side to figure out how heavy the sponge is,you um you use gra  you put grams in the other side you put grams on the other side to figure out how heavy the sponge is
3879,you don't want to measure too heavy things or else i ca or else you can't put enough grams in one side and you won't and it will be like extra heavy,you don't want to measure too heavy things or else i k or ele you can't put enough grams in one side and it wo't and it'll be like xtor heavy
3880,um well you have the dry sponge or the wet sponge so the wet sponge you minus the you minus the grams of the wet sponge and when you minus the grams of the dry sponge to the wet sponge,um well you have the dry sponge of the wet sponge so the wet sponge you minusse the you minusse the grams of the wet sponge i mean you minuse thegrams of the dry sponge to the wet sponge
3881,well when i looked through it i figured out that the wet sponge is heavier and it is sixteen grams,uh when it looks through it i forget out that the wet sponge is heavier and it is sixteen grams
3882,well i observed that there is three grams in one cup and then there's the sponge and the li and the two lines match up on the balance so that means that the sponge is three grams,well i observed that there is three grams in one cup and then there's the sponge and the l in the two lines t match up on the balance so that means the sponge is three grams
3883,a soaked sponge will be bigger a lot heavier because it's full with water and yeah,a soake sponge will be bigger a lot heavier because it's full with water and yeah
3884,it is going good,it is going good
3885,goodbye,good bye
3886,um i do what i just did but with a wet sponge,um i do what i just did but with a wet sponge
3887,the dry one will be the least heaviest the wet one will be heavier and bigger and the soaked will be the biggest and the heaviest,the dry one will be the least heaviest the white one will be heavier and bigger and the sacte will be the biggest and the heaviest
3888,um the wet sponge was heavier than the dry sponge,um the wet sponge is heavier than the dry sponge
3889,we find out that um the dry sponge is not very big um and it doesn't look too heavy,you find out that um the dry spongee is not very big um and it doesn't look too heavy
3890,um well we used a balance to figure it out and um with grams we would try to even everything out,um well we used a balance to figure it out and um with grams we would try to even everything out
3891,well the sponge in the middle would be little less heavier than the soaked cause it won't be soaked all the way and and it'll be big bigger and heavier than the dry,well the sponge and the meedtle would be a little less heavier than the saced becase it wouldn't be saked all the way and and it'lld be bigg bigger and heavier than the dry
3892,um uh what is going on is there's this sponge this sponge is heavier than the than the empty cup so so the cup with the sponge is going is um tipping over,um uh what it's going on is there's the sponge the sponge is heavier than the than the empty cup so so the cup with the sponge is going is um tipping over
3893,the wa the thing is um the thing in the right cup is a lot heavier than the air,the wot by the thing is um the thing and the right cup is a lot heavier than the air
3894,i noticed that the sponge is exactly three grams in this picture,i noticed that the sponge is exactly three grams in this picture
3895,you were trying to figure out how heavy how heavy each object was,you were trying to figure out how heavy how heavy each object was
3896,you can use your balance like to figure out how heavy for example you can figure out how heavy a piece of a cu a gold coin is or money,you can use your balance like to figure out how heavy for example you can figure out how heavy a piece of a c a gold coin is or munny
3897,um well you can measure,um well you can measure
3898,it tells me that um you would just basically um one gram is like half of a gram a kilogram is half of a gram,it tells me that um you would just kept basically um one gram is like half of a gra a kilogram is half of a  gram
3899,so um i don't know,so um  i don't know
3900,i found out that the shoe was one thousand one hundred grams,i soum nout that the shoe was one thousand one hundred grams
3901,i figured out that the orange was three hundred twenty five grams,i figured out that the orange was three hundred twenty five grams
3902,you couldn't do it because there's not enough gram pieces,you couldn't do it because there's not enough gram pieces
3903,you could um get you could make um one hundred gram gram piece and then you could put that in and see what how it was going then,you could um get you could make um one hundred gram gram piece and then you could put that in and see what how it was going then
3904,we were seeing like how many gram blocks it took to like weigh a pencil a glue stick a scissors a ruler and a thermometer,we were seeing like how many gram blocks it took to like weigh a penci a glue sick a ciser's a ruler and a thermometer
3905,you um so you i can't tell anymore i kind of said it all,you um so you b can't tell anymore i kind a said at all
3906,one thousand,one thousand
3907,you would use it when there like when it's bigger when something weighs more than one thousand,you would use it when they're like when it's bigger when something weighs more than one thousand
3908,i noticed that there are five twenties which equal one hundred and then there's gravel on the other side so the gravel must be one hundred grams,i noticed that there are five twentys which equal one hundred and then there's gravel on this other side som the gravel must be one hundred grams
3909,it tells me that the metal disk is eight grams,it tells me that the metal desk is eight grams
3910,grams are the um metric system of weight of weight and mass i think,grams are the um metric system of weight of weight and mass i think
3911,i observed that there is um i don't see i don't really observe anything,i observed that there is um i don't see i don't really observe anything
3912,you can f you i don't know,you can  i don't know
3913,you would get a really accurate um answer,you would get a really accurate um answer
3914,um two of the two of the five grams it equals a ten gram and then after you have two ten grams it equals a twenty gram,when you have um five blue little grams then it equals five um one as te five grams and once you have
3915,to use you would need to use the same if you were measuring a pencil you would need to use the same pencil and um and you would need to use grams,to u you would need to use the same if you were measuring a pencil you would need to use the same pencil and um and you would need to use grams
3916,you would you would um d do you would do um like you would measure s you would weigh it with something that's a thousand grams or more,you would you would um dduce you would do  um like you would measure sep you would weigh it with something that's a thousand grams or more
3917,i noticed that that um i don't that maybe that there is ten kilograms in one gram,i noticed that um i do that maybe that thereis ten kilograms and one gram
3918,i'm good thank you,i'm good thank you
3919,when you weigh an apple or an orange um you would need a lot more like materials that you can measure and actually get it balanced,when you wea an apple or an orange um you would need a lot more like material so you could measure it and actually get it balanced
3920,the car in the picture weighs seventy grams,the car in the picture weighs seventy grams
3921,you could use it as a reference because if you had a nickel you could know you can like if you had a lot of nickels you could put em in a cup and then measure it like that,you could use it as a reference because if you had a nickle you could know you can like if you had a lot of nickles you could put em in a cup and then measure it like that
3922,a kilogram is less than a gram you use it when something's less than a gram,a kilogram is less than a gram you use it when something's less than a gram
3923,um i would describe em that it would go down really far and then it started to go up up up,um i would describe em that it would go down really far and then it started to go up up up
3924,that um in ten minutes it dropped all the way to it dropped a the way to ten,that um in ten minutes it dropped all the way two it dropped uh the way to ten
3925,i discovered that it got much colder,i discovered that it got much colder

4094,i think about is it hot cold or just warm,i think about is it hot cold or just warm
4095,so that you can all know the exact temperature of the water and nobody will get confused in between which one is warmer and which one is colder,so that you can all know the exact temperature of the water and nobody will get confused in between which one is warmer and which one is colder
4096,we were seeing ha which cup was warmer and we figured out that the b cup was the coldest but a and c were the same temperature,we were seeing ha which cup was warmer and we figured out that d b cup was the coldest but a and c were the same temperature
4097,it's when it's hot when it goes up and it's cold when it's go dow when it goes down,it's when it's hort when it goes up and it's cold when it's goe down and when it goes down
4098,you u we're using celsius in this unit,you ou were using celsius in this unit
4099,um we we i found out that the it went in between fifty and ten which is thirty and yeah,um we  we've i found out that the it wone in between fifty and ten which is thirty and yeah
4100,we're mixing the ice and the co and the hot water together and we're gonna get a new temperature of water,we're mixing the ice and the coal in the hot water together and we're gonn get a new temperature of water
4101,we put a thermometer in,we put a thermometer in
4102,you use grams,you use grams
4103,i found out that the dry sponge was three grams and that but that it was three grams,i found out that the dry sponge was three grams and that what that it was three grams
4104,i forget and i don't know,i forget and i don't know
4105,a soaked sponge um i don't know,ah soake spon um i don't know
4106,i know that if you um put a dry sponge in water that it will like z absorb and get much bigger,i know that if you um put it a dry sponge in water that it will ab absorb and get much bigger
4107,um the s i observed that the sponge the dry sponge soaked up um thirteen grams of water,um this i observed that the sponge the dry sponge soaked a um thirtreen grams of water
4108,um i don't really know anymore,um i don't really know anymore
4109,the sponge in the middle is wet and it doesn't have as much water in it as the soaked sponge,the sponge in the middle is wet and it doesn't have as much water in it as the sat sponge
4110,i noticed that the dry sponge equals three grams,i notice that the dry sponge equals three grams
4111,you um when you don't you would count you count the grams and the cup without the sponge in it,you um when you don't you would count you count the grams ind the cup without the sponge in it
4112,i noticed that um that they were balanced and the white thing was in line with the blue um line,i noticed that um that they were balanced and the white thing was in line with the blue um line
4113,you can see how much water the sponge soaked up by um doing the answer you got minus the weight of the dry sponge,you can see how much water the sponge soaked up by um doing the answer you got minus the weight of the dry sponge
4114,it's going good thank you,it's going good thank you
4115,we were trying to figure out how much they weighed,we were trying to figure out how much they weighhed
4116,so these objects there's a dry sponge a wet s sponge and a soaked sponge and the dry sponge is the lightest then the wet sponge then the soaked sponge is the heaviest,so these objects there's a dry sponge oh wet sa sponge and the soaked sponge and the dry sponge is the lightest then the wet sponge then the soake sponge is the heaviest
4117,um a wet sponge is um soft is squishier and um it feels softer and yeah,um a wet sponge is um soft is squishier and um it feels softer and yeah
4118,when you have a balance and a sponge you can um put the sponge in one side and put gram pieces on the other side to see how much it weighs,when you have a balance in a sponge you can um put the sponge in one side and put gram pieces on the other side to see how much it weighs
4119,i found out that the dry sponge when it when it's soaked absorbed like um like ten times its own weight,i found out that the dra sponge when it went to soaked absorbd like um like ten times it's own weight
4120,it's when it stops absorbing water,it's when it stops absorbing water
4121,you can use a balance to measure the weight and the mass of something,you can use the balance to masure the weight and the mass of something

4139,but my arm span and my heighth,tha my arm spans and my heithe
4140,i measured from my wrist to my elbow,i measured from my rest to my elbow
4141,i don't know,i don't know
4142,you use a ruler or a meter stick or like something like that,you use a ruler or a meter stick or like something like thatt
4143,you would um have to measure it so you would get the right answer and be sure you know how like tall you are like measuring the heighth,you would um have to measure it so you would get the red answer and be sure you know how like tall you are sens war m like measuring the height
4144,you wou you could still use a meter stick but you would use the centimeters on it,you would you could still use a meter stick but you would use the centimeters on it
4145,you have to begin at a corner and end at a kind of corner otherwise you won't really have a quite accurate measurement,you have to be gin at a corner and end at a kindo corner otherwise you won't really have a quite accurate measurement
4146,i forget i think,i forget i think
4147,when i figured out how long no tall my ear was it was really cool because it was the same length as my nose,when i figured out how long nop tall my eair was it was really cool because it was the same length as my nose

4149,the person is measuring his pinkie and finding out that it is one centimeter wide,the person is measuring his pinkie and finding out that it is one centimeter wide
4150,you use centimeters to measure when something's not as long as a meter so you can find the right answer,we use centimeters to measure hen somethings not as long as a meter so you can find the right answer
4151,l it fits in because if you know how wide your pinkie is then you can tell like objects with your pinkie so you know how um wide or tall they are,wel if it's in because if you know how wide your pinkie is then you can count like objects with your pinkie so you' know how um wide or tall they are
4152,you would use em when there's for the millimeters you wouldn't use it when it then when it's smaller than a centimeter and you would use centimeters when it's smaller than a decameter,you would use them when there's  for the millimeters you wouldn't use it when it then when it's smaller than a centimeter and you would use centimeters when it's smaller than a decimeter
4153,um i don't know,um i don't know
4154,um you would you measured it twice because if you're like meter if you had a me meter measuring um tape then it will kind of go like,like it would just go bac it would be very rinklly so you couldn't really get ah quite precice answer
4155,yeah,yeah
4156,you could use a ruler and then like every rule most rulers are the same size so you would get a more accurate answer,you could use ar ruler and then like every rul most rulers are the same size so you would get a more accurate answer
4157,it was about um to see how um how long it how wide it was and how long it was,it was about um to see how um m how long it how  wide it was and how long it was
4158,lot of sense,lot of sense

4163,it worked,it worked
4164,hi my name is nicky and i'm nine,hi my name is snoke and i'm nine
4165,you got uh a much different answer so it would be a really bad um strategy to use straws,you got  um much different answer so it would be a really bad um stratagy to use straws
4166,hi,hi
4167,it isn't a real good um strategy because um there's a lot of different sized straws in the world so it's really not a good strategy,it isn't a real good um stratagy because um there's a lot of different size straws in the world so it's really not a good stratagy
4168,marty i have to go,already i have to go
4169,yeah,yeah
4170,uh when you use group a's and for the width it only take four straws and when you use group b's straws it takes um i think twelve,uh when you use group as and for the width it only takes four straws and when you use group bee straws it hags um i think twelve
4171,i used a straw and then i used um a measuring tape with um centimeters on it,i used a straw and then i used am a measuring tape with um centimeters on it
4172,yes,yes
4173,i would be trying to figure out how long that is the thing you asked me to measure is,i would be trying to figure out how long that is the thing you asked me to measure is

4175,a yard stick,a yard stick
4176,um we then we read a book it was about how we think feet got to be,um we then we wread a book it was about how we think fee got to b
4177,yeah i did learn uh we had like this long thing with meter,yeah i didn't learn to  and we had like this long thing with meter
4178,no we just uh the straws were just uneven,no we just  the straws were just uneven
4179,um we imagined pictures like it a light would be like a l kilometer um we imagined things that might be a kilometer,um we a mage n pictures like if a light would be like a lo kilometer um we amma  thing that might be a kilometer
4180,uh mile is very long it's very big um would probably be about half a mile,uh a  mile is very long it's very big t would probably be about half amile
4181,thousand a thousand wait um a hundred,thousan ex shouvan wlit um a hundred
4182,right there uh huh,right there
4183,that means you would start using feet um or centimeters or any other,that maydo t start your the feet um or centimeters ore
4184,well i learned that um part of it is a centimeter,well i learned that it's um part of it is a centimeter
4185,like there would be one straw that was this long and then another straw that was this long,like there'ld be one straw that was this longer than another straw as this long
4186,um the least amount would be a meter,um the least amount would be a meter
4187,it has a thousand in a millimeter i mean wait a millimeter there's a thousand m um millimeters in a meter,and tere's a thousand and a millimeter  it's a millimeter theyre's a thousand um millimeters in a meter
4188,um they're centimeters and they're very small they are like the length of a bug um they're but there is something smaller than a centimeter,um they're centimeters and they're very small theyre like the lengs of  bug ellm they're but the're is something smaller than a centimeter
4189,but my desk is like way back there so,but my desk is like pay back there so i o't really menit
4190,um no,um no
4191,um he's three feet long,um he's three feet long
4192,um because straws are uneven and a meter is a um a good way because it's even it's always even,um because strawter an even in a meter is a um a good way because it's even it's always even
4193,thousand,shouvand
4194,um you could measure a bug,um you can measure a bug
4195,hi,hi
4196,yeah cause we learned that,yeah cause we learned that
4197,a y a yard stick a meter,a a yard stick a meter
4198,well we would use them so that if you hike you would know how far you would need to go or how long you have hiked,well we would use them so that if you higke you would know how far ywoul need to go or how long you'l have height
4199,uh the tip of a pencil um how skin skinny a pencil is,um the tipe of a pencilm um i skin ts skinny a pencil is
4200,you would,you
4201,um a hundred,uh hum a hundred
4202,it is a millimeter,it is a millimeter
4203,but they could be uneven straws,but they could be unev straws
4204,well when we we kinda like felt it and we i think it was like the same except yeah,well when we  kinda like ealtayd we i think it was like the same except yeah
4205,um grams wa and water oh yeah li yeah,um grams water and water oh yeah yeah
4206,um we used the metric system,um well use e metric system

4219,well i know that we now we i know we that in u s a we don't use it um,well i know that we now wa i know we that in the erth way we don't use it um
4220,well actually they were saying um a and c were the same and then b was cold,wel t tro they're the same um a and c were the same and then b was cold
4221,um i think so,um i think though
4222,well we thought that it was re we thought it was warm and then we got really cold really cold then it just started to warm up,well we thought that it was real we wa thot sought it was warm and then wit got really cold and maye cold ad then it started warm up

4230,yeah i'd like to,yeah i liked o
4231,um i've liked how we got to d use the thermometer the first one to use it,um i've liked how we got to't use a thermometer  it 'idn't me like the first one to use it
4232,well yeah um the important thing about that is if you don't use the same you don't get an accurate thing,well you have um the plert thing about that if if you don't use the same you don't get enaccurate samg
4233,it burn boiled,it wer boil
4234,yep,yep

4242,um grams,um grams
4243,um we had like little bags and we put sand in there so we ha each group had each team had two bags and then we put them into a giant bag and,um we had like little bags and we put the in in there so we h each group had each tem had two bags and then we put them into a giant bag and
4244,um oh grams,um uh grams
4245,we knew it,or the we nw
4246,well hmm,well
4247,yes we know that um it's a wet sponge because of the size that would mean that this much grams equals a wet sponge,yes we know that um it's a wet sponge because of the size that would mean that this much gram's equals a wet sponge
4248,well this i we know that's that's a wet s sponge from let's see where is that picture,well this is we know that that's a wet ssponge from see where's thi pickt ture
4249,uh hi cool,uh hi tu uh
4250,um we did measurement today um,um we did measure ent today um
4251,n mmm,n mm

4253,grams eighty three grams,grams eighty for grams
4254,um it's about h how much you think it is the closest you think it will be,uh um it's about how much you think it is the closerst you think it will be
4255,yes before we me um estimated the weight of the sponge um the dry sponge we estimated,yes before we met um estimated the weight of the sponge um the dry sponge we estimated
4256,yeah we knew that the spon the dry sponge was two grams so we minus two grams from eighty five and we got eighty three,yeah we knew that the sponge the dry sponge was two grams so we migntus two grams from eighty five and we got eighty three
4257,oh i don't really remember,oh i don't really remember
4258,well we knew it i know it's not a kilometer cause that's in me like um,well we knew it i know it's not a kilometer cause that's imi like haght um
4259,yeah gram gram piece like,yeah gram gram piece like
4260,yup,yep
4261,um well we our teacher um did that but i think it's still drying out think so,um well we d our teacher um did that but i think it's they were drying out  think so
4262,we did um weighing how much sponge ca e um water can take up,we did um learning how much sponge ca um um water can tpacke up

4272,i don't know,i don't know
4273,um it was squishy we didn't really feel it though yeah i didn't really feel,um it was squisy we didn't really feel though yeah i didn't really feel
4274,um well when put it in the water we saw it like a giant but when you took it out it was smaller,um well when we put it in the water we saw it like a giante but when you took it out i was smaller
4275,yeah,ah
4276,what,what
4277,i haven't done that i don't know yet,i haven't learne tat i don't know yet
4278,um it's keeping all the water in there until you can squeeze it out,um it's keeping all the water in there until you can squeeze it out

4282,um stan a standard unit when you use liquids would be water or like the kinda liquid that you're using,um sta a standard unit when you use liquids would be water or like the kind of liquid yet you're using
4283,the vile,the vial
4284,yeah like you could like um use like take the smaller and put it somewhere else and like take turns using it,yeah like you could like um you wousd like take the d smaller then put it o somewhere else ind thike take turms using it
4285,i think this one is,i think this one is
4286,like pour it and then see how many milliliters it is,like pourit and then f um and the milliliters it is
4287,well because it's higher and it kinda looks like like it was then and it like it looks like then and like looks the same,well because it's higher and it kinda ooks like like there's then and ou look it looks like that it looks looks the same
4288,of something it's like a k like a think like that looks like kinda like this,oh something it's like oklike a thing like that looks like kind like this
4289,well,well
4290,and this these two things,and this these two things
4291,well you look at it and like go like this with your hands and then like,well you cd th look at it and like go like this with your hands and then like
4292,guess what um estimating would be,guess we um estimating would be

4295,uh well you could do the cup and like could have,uh well you could use the cup and like a cup
4296,i know,i kno
4297,because if you don't want the same one you're not accurate,because if you don't want the same one you're not accurate
4298,uh no we didn't it was not um we didn't do it with f we didn't it wasn't full we just poured water and was like empty,uhm no we didn't it was not um we didn't do it with f we didn't it wasn't full but just poured water wif like emty
4299,um we fi we figured out we went like this and this and then we did all of it well we went to a and then class b like went like we would take the thing and pour in more and more,um we fic we figured out we went like this andthen this and then we did all of it well we went to ai and in class we like went like we would take the thing and pour and more and more
4300,well uh well milliliters are um a liter is i think a thousand milliliters and milliliters are li like a drop,well ah well milliliters are um a liter  i think a thousand milliliters and milliliters are  like a drop
4301,um you could use um this,um you could use um this
4302,um i don't know,um i don't know
4303,um well we figured out that it we that the soda company the um people who made these w w left a little space because um because uh,um well we figured out that it wa thet an soda company the um people wo made these w wer left a little space because um because he
4304,i think graduated cylinder,i think graduated cylinder
4305,well then you know that it's well then if you pour and it gets all the way up there and then you still have extra you could pour it into a one liter beaker and then pour the rest into here,well then you know that it's well then if you pour it and gets all the way up there and then you stal f xtra you could pour it into a one liter beaker and then pour the rest into here
4306,um es measure stuff smaller than a liter,um as measure stuff s smaller than a liter
4307,yeah,yeah
4308,you could like,you could like

4461,to help it grow because like it has to have fresh air nice cool water and sunlight to to grow,tohelp it ggrow ecause like yi has to have fresh air nice cool water and sunlight to grow
4462,well it has everything it has a water the air the sunlight and everything it needs to grow and look,well it has everything it has a water the air the sunlight everything it needs to grow and i look
4463,it needs sunlight to grow because if it doesn't have any sunlight it just flops,it needs sunlight to grow bcause if it doesn't have any sunlight it just flops up
4464,well it just needs water oxygen carbon dioxide sunlight and yeah that's about it to survive,well it just needs water oxygen carbon dioxide t sunlights and that's about it type survive
4465,well it looks a little better but it still needs water to grow because like that's the main thing that it needs it needs the water to get it all like all like woo awake so it can grow more,well it looks little better but it still needs water to grow cause like that's the mein thing that it needs it needs the water to get it like l like wol awake so it can grow more

4479,not learned because you're not just taught you're just not taught like you're just oh it's time to come out now they just they just come out whenever they want to come out,non learned ecause you're nice o erin just not tap like youre just like a it was time to come out now they just they just come out whenever they want to come out
4480,the grass the trees the water rocks dirt leaves lot of the leaves lots of water you know,the grass the trees the water rocks dirt leaves lots  leaves lots of water nd o
4481,i am good i know why i guess so,i'm good and away i gues
4482,it depends because sometimes it just an instinctive but sometimes they have to be taught,it depends cause sometime it's just a n instinctthing but sometimes they have to be tougt
4483,i think there's a little is a a learned behavior,i think this  little isa learned behavior
4484,it's his adaptation,it's his adaptation

4493,well they like work together to make a system i think,well they like work together to make a system i think
4494,i think it makes it a system but i the way what was i think i i don't know i've not very sure about that,i think it makes a system bu the by um the way it moves i think i i don't know i'm not very sure about that
4495,i don't know,i don't know
4496,the eyes the heart and the organs,the eyes the heart and the organs
4497,i think i think it has to do with systems is because that there's a lot of things that can move like a human body a suitcase car the earth i don't know i'm not very sure,i think i think it has to do ith systems is because that there's a lot of things that can move like a human body a suitcase car the earth i don't know  not very sort

4522,yeah,yeah
4523,that's about from the back of this chair to olivia back there,that's about from the back of this chaire to alivia back there
4524,yeah that means that it's ten straws across from me and then three straws this way,yeah that means that it's ten straws across for me and then three straws this way
4525,no,no
4526,we measured our desks in straws,we measured our desks and straws
4527,well that they are that they sometimes do wrong measurements cause they get bent and stuff and then that shrinks em a little bit,well that they are that they sometimes do wrong measurements cause they get bent and stuff and then that shrinks them a little bit
4528,that t the dry sponge is two grams the wet sponge is sixteen grams and the water wa so the water was fourteen grams,thet to the dry sponge is two grams the wet sponge is sixteen grams and the water w so the water was fourteen grams
4529,t for scrubbing for scrubbing because you can get a lot of water in it and then when you push down the water comes out and then you can do the same thing to put soap in it,for scrabbing for scribbing because you can get a lot of water in it and then when you push down the water comes out and then you can do the same thing to put soape in it

4583,they're designed to float and hold people,they're designe to float and hold people
4584,it sh they each show um how many milliliters of water they each hold,ich they each show um how many milliliters of water they each holder
4585,each are different height and um they each sink uh lower and higher in to the water depending on how tall they are,each are a different height and um they each sink uh lower andhigher into the water depending on how chall they are
4586,they might have been um different cups and they might not have been equally um made and uh cut levelly,they might have been um different cups and they might not have been equally um made and uh cut levely

4588,um i was amazed to see that when we put the passengers in um um just a little cup of you put a circle around it and even the balance then it may it you could get a lot of passengers in there,m i was maze to see that when we put the passengers in um uh just a little cup if you put a circle around it and even the balance then it mae it you could get a lot of passengers in there
4589,we made two boats that were three centimeters long,we ned two boats that were three centimeters long
4590,by um doing them um correctly and orderly and uh slowly so that you can get uh accurate data,by um doing them uhm correctly and orderly and uh slowly so that you can get a accurate dat of
4591,um i had another day in science and uh we worked on boats and um we uh had variables and other like things and it was in like a little tub,um i had another day in science and oh we worked on boats and um we uh had variables and other like things and it was in i like a little tub
4592,well when we measured them we made sure that they were each uh different um height and yeah,well when we measured them we made sure that they were each a different um height and yeah
4593,good,good
4594,you could may be add more pennies or take away the penny and add something um different like a different object to it,you could maybe add more pennies or take away the penny and ha it's something um different like a different object to it
4595,you have to pick it up and then let it swing and when it goes back and forth and like,you have to pick it up and then let it swing and when it goes back and forth and like
4596,that with the higher swings um the um in fifteen seconds it did um it had more cycles,that with the higher swings um the um in fifteen seconds it did um it had more cycles
4597,when you put it at the top it starts but gradually it'll start to um decrease um in how high it goes cause there's not enough force and the weight is weighing it down,when you put it at the top it starts but gradually it'll start to um dcrease um and how high it goes cause there's not enough force and the weight is weighing it down
4598,well when it swings back and forth the weight would cause it to sink lower and not go as high when it comes back around and completes the cycle,well when it swings back and forth the weight would cause it to sink lower and not go as high when it comes back around and completes the cycles
4599,it means that it's a certain thing in an experiment that you could change or keep the same and it's part of the experiment,it means that it's a certain thing an an experiment that you could change or keep the same and it's part of the experiment
4600,well there is more um there is one on one and then like it goes in the number of how many there are and i think well well of course it will it would cause more weight,well there's more um there's one on one and then like it goes in the number of how many there are end i think that well of course it will sit would cause more weight
4601,when i click the bob goes to where i clicked,when i click the bob goes to where i clicked
4602,what's the table for,what's a tableing
4603,the cycle is when it goes back and back and then back again to where it used to be,the cycle is when it goes back and back and then back again to where it used to be
4604,yes,yes

4606,uh at the end of the string there is its weight and it will keep the string moving,uh at the end of the string there's it's weight and it will keep the string moving
4607,well since it's at the end of the string it will cause the string not to go flimsy and around,well since it's at the end of the string it will cause the string not to go frumziing around
4608,it goes down and up and then down and up again to uh the place where it was but it's still lower than,it goes down and up and then down and up again to uh hplace where it was but it's still lower tha
4609,i may put um something that's not a penny and may be it would cause more weight,i might put um something that's not a penny and maybe it would cause more weight
4610,may be if you um had a bigger pencil to hang it from then um it might uh affect may be how high it goes,maybe if you um had a bigger pencil to hang it from then um it might u affect maybe how high it goes
4611,when i did it two times uh i realized that the cycles were the same both times,whone i did it two times uh i reallized that the cycleswere the same both times
4612,you can see how many times it will s make a cycle um in fifteen seconds,you can see how many times it will uh smake a cycle um in fifteen seconds
4613,you can collect it on a data file,you can collect it on a da ta fial
4614,that would depend on what kind of variables they were and what they were changing,that would depend on what kind of variables they were and what they were changing

5367,it's flowing and from the bottom of the lighht bulb,it's flowing in from the bottom of the of thelight bulb
5368,that the top one is showing that it's not showing a pathway in the bottom one that showing a pathway then top one is bright and the one is dim,that the top one is showing is not showing the pathway and the bottom one is showing a pathway and  top one is bright and the bottom one one is dim
5369,well it's showing energy from a light bulb from the other light bulb,well it's it's showing energy from te light bulb from the other light bulb
5370,well it's a going out of that the negative side going into both the batteries and then coming back into the d cell,well it's going out of the negative side going into both the batteries and then coming back into the d cell
5371,ah umm the top two they would be the best,the the top to they would be the best
5372,they both are using the same pathway,they both ae they both ae using the same pathway
5373,well it's showing the same it's showing the same the same pathway so though not going to get much electricity into them,well it's showing the same it's showing the same pathway so the' noit goinna get as much as electricity into them
5374,well the tube light bulbs were showing the same pathway of energy and they won't be as bright that by it,well the two light bulbs are showing the same pathway of energy and they won't be as bright that way
5375,well the top ones are bright the bottom one is not so bright and but like the bottom one is showing a pathway what just to it the top ones out,well the top ones are bright the bottom one is not so bright and but like the bottom one is showing a pathway of electricity the top ones solved
5376,well the flow they should the same flow so they repels was going to be as light,well the flow they show the same flow so the light bulbs arn' going na be as light
5377,the series circuits impel good,theyre selies circuits and plelel circuits
5378,energy,energy
5379,bye mornie,bye marni
5380,they give the light bulb energy,they give the light bulb energy
5381,the negative side,the negative side
5382,it lights up,it lights up
5383,electricity,electricity
5384,it takes the it takes the energy all though electricity from the battery in it ended though and it like mix the light bulb light,it takes the it takes the energy a the electricity from the battery and it and the and it like makes the light bulb light
5385,it gives the energy to the light bulb,it gives it gives the energy to the light bulb
5386,it wouldn't give it any electricity because though can be any going out into the positive side of the d cell,it wouldn't give it any electricity becausethere couldn't be any going out into the positive side of the d cell
5387,they light up if it has a source of energy,they they light up if it has a source of energy
5388,the negative,the negative
5389,a battery wires and then light bulb,a battery wires and a light bulb
5390,that the d cell gives like if wires are connected to it and the wires are connected to the light bulb it gives it like energy to make the light bulb light,that the d cell gives like if th wires are connected to it and the wires are connected to the light bulb it gives it umlike energy to make the light bulb light
5391,if though connected to the d cell they transfer the energy to the light bulb,if they're connected to the d cell they transfer the energy to the light bulb
5392,the power comes from the negative and it goes to the light bulb and comes through the positive,the the power comes from the negative and it goes though the light bulb and comes through the positive
5393,a battery,a battery
5394,it goes toward with the side of the light bulb and it goes up to the filament and it goes down it goes keep going forward then it goes to the positive side,it goes towards the side of the light bulb and it goes up to the filament and it goes d it goes uit goes keeps going foward and it then it goes to the positive side
5395,it's the source that gives us the light bulb energy,it's the source that gives the might bub energy
5396,energy,energy
5397,both of the wire those one wire going from the bottom and those one wire going from the side,b both of the  there's one wire going from the bottom and there's one wire going from the side
5398,how do make a light bulb light,how to make a light bulb light
5399,the battery turned and now its going the opposite way and like its going into different direction all in though the light bulb is still lighting,the battery turned and now it's going the opposite way a and like it's going in different direction now and the the light bulb is still lighting
5400,good,good
5401,the d cell is giving the light bulb energy through the wires,the d cell is giving tethelight bulb energy through the wires
5402,the light bulb now lead up want to changes to the side,the light bulb now lit up when i changed it to the side
5403,it means that it will recieves but it will recieves the energy from the d cell,it means that it was ss the it receives the energy from the d cell
5404,okay,okay
5405,it moves the opposite way,it moves the opposite way
5406,yup,yep
5407,its flowing all in one direction to the light because the positive side is going through the battery into the negative side,it's flowing all in one direction to the light because because  hthe pus the positive side is going through the battery into the negative side
5408,it's to the left and like center to the left and so it connected to the metal pole it won't the motor won't move so that means the switch is making it off,it's it's to the left and like since it's to the left and it's not connected to the metal pol it won't the motor won't move so that means the switch is making it off
5409,the motor is moving,the motoris moving
5410,the solar panel was giving it electricity to d cell can move,the solar panels giving it electricity so it can move
5411,its sunny all in the solar panel is giving the electricty to the motor,it's en and the solar panel is giving electricity to the motor
5412,it doesn't move,it doesn't move
5413,it doesn't give electricity to get it doesn't give electricity,it doesn't give t electricity to ge to it doesn't give it electricity
5414,the motor starts moving,the motor starts moving
5415,that is that its off i think it means that is off,that it's that the the it's that's it's off i think it means that it's off
5416,makes the motor move,makes the motor move
5417,the motor starts running,the motor starts running
5418,no i do not,no i do not
5419,they the sun come if the sun is shining on them it gives the electricity to all those things,they the sun come if te sun is shining on it it gives electricityty to other things
5420,we have been learning about motors and wires and when they connect the motor moves and we think,we've been learning learning about motors and wires and when they connect the motor moves and everything
5421,now the electricity goes into the motor because it's not travelling through the metal and it is make the motor run,no electricity goes into the motor becase i's not traveling through the metal and it doesn't make the motor run
5422,it gives the solar panel electricity to give it to the motor so it moves so the motor runs and moves,it gives a solar panels electricity to give it to the motor so it moves so the motor runs and moves
5423,the motor is working,the motor is walking
5424,bye mornie,bye marnie
5425,open,open
5426,the flag is moving and its important because that means the motor is working and its moving,the flag is moving and it's important because that means the motor is working and it's moving
5427,the switch needs to be closed,the switch needs to be closed
5428,those two wires connected to the part even negative side of the d cell and its making the motor moves,those two wires connected to the positive and negative side of the d cell andit's making the motor move
5429,that it turns to the sun shine untill that just being gives the electricity to all those things,that it turns the sun shine into electricity and gives te electricity to other things
5430,i will no electricity would come through it because at there was no sun on it make a interval electricity,it w no electricity would come through it because it thors no sun on it to make it into electricity
5431,its in the close position,it's in the closed position
5432,those are electricity going into it,there's electricity going into it
5433,the track giving the electricity to move,it's not giving itelectricity to move
5434,so that ended the positive side of the d cell that while is going through the metal connecting to the other side of the wire is going to the motor and that's giving the power,so that and the positive side the d cell  that wire is going through the metal connecting to the other side of the wire an it's going to the motor and that's giving a power
5435,the motor starts moving,the motor starts moving
5436,it showing that the d cell is giving the motor electricity so the motor moves,it's showing that the d cell is giving the moto electricity so the motor moves
5437,the motor starts moving,the motor starts moving
5438,the solar panel has to get sunshine,the solar panel has to get sunshine
5439,magnet,brnit
5440,the switch has to be on,the switch have
5441,the flag moves,the flag moves
5442,well if sun is sharing the cell then its working but when it goes off there is no work and the flag will,when the sun is hitting the cell then it's its working but when it goes off the it win't work and the flag wol
5443,the electricity will go through the d cell and it will turn on the flag,the electricity won't go through the d cell and it wiln't turn ot the flag
5444,the d cells electricity makes the flag move,producers electricity makes i
5445,the electricity goes through the wires and until it's cell and then it goes interact when will contraction and then it makes the flag move,the electricity goes through the wires and into the fel and then it goes into that little cotraction and then it makes the flag move
5446,it makes the flag move,it makes the flag move
5447,no nail,o
5448,and electricity go through the two wires to make a flag move because the flag is metal on both sides so the metal touches that it turns on make through electricity,it's the electricity gon trough the two wires to make he flag move because the flag is metal bon both sides so when metal touches it it turns out an way to electricity
5449,the cell has behind the sun and then the wires connect all the way to the contraction and then make reflective so electricity goes through the few thing over and over and over,the cell has to be hidting the sun and then the wires connect all the way to the contraction and then makes the flag move so e electricity goes through the fold thing over and over and over
5450,it's on the metal where the wire is so it doesn't count all the way but it goes on like so there just it is electricity pass there so they was on top what a pretty as much electricity,it's on the metal where  the wire is so it doesn't go all the way but it goes on  like phalthway so then itci the electricity faster so if i was on top i wouldn't pretty u t lec te electricity
5451,the electricity going through,that electricity's ging through
5452,because they didn't then it what if work as well as a it's down so while we its dark anything outside will not work,because fit didn't then it wouldn't work aas wells as it is now so when it's dark and it's outside woll not work
5453,it's not going to till because the switches off and it's not creating a circuit to make the flag move,it's not gongna go through because the switch is off and it's not creato the circuit to make the flag meve
5454,no,h
5455,it's not touching metal so where electricity won't go to the flag and it will make a circuit,it's not touching metal so  wh electricity won't go to the flag and it won't make a circit
5456,because the d cell has electricity in it so when then two connecters connect to the metal find on both sides as the switch touches metal then it will start working and create and put it would electricity to the flag,cause the d cell has electricity in it so when the two connectors connect to the metal flag on both sides and the switch touches metal then itill start working and create and prese electricity to the flag
5457,the d cell is at a circuit,the d cell isn't a circuiti i the cell
5458,those are also that electricity so when you put two wires on they and put a set to a d cell and putting into sun then vibrating to be like that electricity going through that cell,those art also about the electricity so when you put two irs on i and s it to a d cell and put it in t sun then it is tat vibrating like a on sstu diit's the electricity going through that s
5459,it has to be on the metal,it has to be on the metal
5460,we've has been creating circuit,we've a creating circuit
5461,then it doesn't work,that it doesn't work
5462,that when i touch it it moves and then i touch it again it moves off the circuit so it will produce the electricity but won't does touch the metal and produces electricity,that when i touch it it moves and then when i touch it again it moves off if the circuit so it will produce  the electricity w cause tuchhe  it produces electricity
5463,because when the wire fix the d cell and other electricity doesn't like contracted like they contracted too,bcause when the wire its the d cell i add on electricity goes its the contraction makes the tract shin work
5464,the flag moves,the flag moves
5465,it wouldn't work because that's be semi and mike has been getting it,it wouldn't work because it has to be sunny and might have  be hidin
5466,electricity is going through it to make it move,electricity is going through it to make it bo
5467,the d cell and the electricity,the d cell and the electricity
5468,the d cell has to be attracted two wires to go through the electricity to get to the move,cell has to be aci to te wires to go  to gos o the electricity to get toth
5469,the flag stops moving because it does the sunlight and it is have electricity between the wires,the flag stops inthe i because it it doesn't have light and it doesn't heavy electricity betwe
5470,no metal is put touching those two wires and like that and connect still just ready to get the,metal is ur touching to the iron so it is i con ec he electricity to get the oe
5471,i talk to you later bye,ill tto youlater bye
5472,you're separate no and there its it's like we better so yeah,ous a put a nail in there it's it's like  way better so yeah
5473,i don't know,i don't know
5474,its flowing through electricity,it's flowing through electricity
5475,electricity is going through it okay,electricity is going through it oka
5476,and finnaly met before,i'm fine we've meent before
5477,we've been learning science you can talking to me about it,we've been learning science ever since youve been talking to me about it
5478,your down,you're dung
5479,because there not metal like all the other once,cause they're not metal like all the other ones
5480,it works because it's a metal,it works cause it's metal
5481,we seen each other before,we've seen each other before
5482,just draw the tape the spiral that rock in stuff are all insulators but a other stuff is conductors,the straw the tape the sponge the rock and stuff are all insulators but iall the other stuff is conductors
5483,one the metal is touching the switch so i already know that,tushing thiswing the metal is touching the switch soyea
5484,the nail,the nail
5485,metal is something if something's metal then and it sticks to something all sides metal then it would work and it would complete conductor,metal if something if something's metal then d it sticks to something else that's metal then it would work and it would complete a conductor
5486,because the switch is metal so that's metal so it's make in a work,cause the switch is metal so that's metal so it's making it work
5487,insulators are some stuff that's not metal but conductors are things are metal that makes just sitting,insulators are some stuff that's not metal but conductors are things that are metal that makes electricity
5488,it's not going because if that's not metal then work,it's not going ecause if that's not metal then it won't work
5489,i don't know can you repeat that please,i don't know can you repeat that please
5490,electricity is going to through the nail,electricity is going through with a nail
5491,its open,it's open
5492,all the objects will not make electricity go,all the objects will not make electricity go
5493,yeah i'm good how are you i know you we met before but no i don't want to meet you,yeah i'm good how are you i know we've been before but no i don't want to meat you
5494,because the switches off and it's creating a circuit electricity all away to that motor,ecause the switch is off and it's creating a circuit and electricity all the way to that nortatig motor
5495,the flag is been moving because the d cell has to be,the flag is  moving ecause the d cell has to be hooked up to the switch
5496,when i click the switch and it goes on the metal it works and goes to the motor circuit it create electricity over that it is on it won't work,when i click the switch and it goes on the metal it works and goes to the motor so it can  create electricity but when t is on it won't work
5497,the cell is hitting the motor so when the cell hits the motor the wires it always to that cell and that it's start working,the sun is hitting the motor so when the sun hits the motor the wire's hit all the way to the cell and then it just starts working
5498,it will stop working because it's not creating electricity,it will stop working because it's lot creating electricity
5499,it is having the electricity going to the motor make a flag move,it is having electricity going to the motor and mak ing flag movve
5500,it doesn't work,it doesn't work
5501,it works,it works
5502,it doesn't work,it doesn't work
5503,we've been learning about circuits,we've been learning about circuits
5504,because if it doesn't have if the sun has to hit that little contraction there then it will work,cause if it doesn't hit if the sun doesn't hit the little contraction there then it won't work
5505,when you click on the cell its starts working will a stops working,whet it when you click on the sun it starts working but when it's a cloudy day t stops working
5506,let the switch has to be off,let the switch has to the off
5507,the d cell is put does the electricity all away to the motor and making the flag move,the d cell is producing electricity all  the way to the motor and making the flag move
5508,no,no
5509,and till,you to
5510,the cell is hitting the motor and the motor set up the two wires all the way to the cell so while though that cell does hitting it it starts working,the sun is hitting the motor and the motor shocked up the two wires all the way to the cell so when the sun is hitting it it it starts working
5511,what,what
5512,it doesn't work,it doesn't work
5513,the flag moves,the flag moves
5514,it doesn't work,it doesn't work
5515,electricity,lctricity
5516,that put does the electricity,theyre producing electricit
5517,it's creating a circuit that makes the motor run and makes the flag move,it's creating a seccond that makes the motor run and makes the flag move
5518,that it runs when the flag moves because the cell is gain electricity from the sun that two wires are hitting the motor so was the two wires make electricity to the motor then the flag move,that it runs an the flag moves because the cell is gettng electricity from the sun the two wires are hitting the motor so when hwhen the two wires making electricity to the motor then the flag moves
5519,that it's off the d cell it's off this the metal so it won't move the flag,that it's off the d cell it's off the the metal so it won't move the flag
5520,it makes it work,it makes it work
5521,it would because it's not really sunny,it wouldn't work because it's not really sunny
5522,okay,okay
5523,the cell has to be hitting it,the sun has to be hitting it
5524,good,good
5525,they make electricity go through,they make electricity go through
5526,it wouldn't work,it wouldn't work
5527,now its going the opposite way but its going same way but if was turned around they would be go in the opposite way,now it's going the apposite way but it's still going the same way but if it was turned around it would be going the opposite way
5528,its going the different way its going like then positive side go in the negative side going these way so its going to the positive and negative side but even light bulb is must be one to the that's i but anyway its going the other,it's going the different way it's going like the e positive sides  go and the negative side's going this way so it's going through the positive othe negative side but even though though light bulb is must be going through that side but any way it's going the other
5529,light,light
5530,okay,okay
5531,than it would work because if it was just at the ba are the two bases of bulb around lights must go up the light bulb so i were work easier,then it wouldn't work because if it was just at the base a ther two bases of the bulb then it wouldn't work cause the wires as t go up the light bulb so it will work easier
5532,the two wires are connected to the negative and positvie side and then the negative goes to the side of the metal of light bulb and then positve side goes up in light bulbs are produces the electricity through the light bulb,the two wires are connected to the negative and positive side and then hthe negative goes to the side of the middle of the light bulb and then the positive side goes up and the lightbulb soit produces the electricity through the light bulb
5533,i'm good,i good
5534,the electricity,electricity
5535,two wires have to be connected to make a complete circuit,two wires have to be connected to a to make a complete circuit
5536,it has to take a path when you collect it,it has to make a path when you connect it
5537,complete circuits,complete circuits
5538,it light up like in her on a lamp electricity goes through and it goes through up and then still make us back up,it lights up like in her on a lamp electricity goes through and then it goes up and then it it goes back
5539,both side,both side
5540,it as how you electricity was to wires,it has to have electricity with two wires
5541,that there is like the electricity the light bulb,that there's always the electricity flowing through lhitl light bulb
5542,electricity,electricity
5543,its negative in positive side connected to light bulb,it's a negative and positive side connected to thelight bulb
5544,i noticed that the flip this that should i noticed that if you'd put put it to the not the negative side they will go up that way but the people on the positive side then you know go the same way that it was in the begin,i noticed that if you flip it this thei notice that if you  put it to the negative side then it will go he opposite way but if you put it on the positive side then it will go the same way that it was in the bign
5545,its flowing throught the light bulb and to the positive side,it's flowing through the light bulb into the positive siide
5546,electricity,electricity
5547,if the circuit,it's a
5548,do you think electricity,do thing electricity
5549,the two wires are connected and the metal is touching,that two wires are connected and the metal is touching
5550,they see a later,see a later
5551,battery light bulb and wire,battery light bulb and wire
5552,i don't know,i don't know
5553,the negative,the negative
5554,electricity,electricity
5555,that they can conncet to each of them but if there if the two wires both at the base of the side of the light bulb it going to light up has it doesn't know,that they can connect to each of them but if they were  if the two wires were both at the base at the side of the light bulb it wouldn't light up as it does now
5556,the ply is that it has to be touching metal with the two wires as we touching the light bulb then order of two,the point is that it has to be touching metal with the two wires has to be touching the light bulbs in order for it to lightp
5557,the really through the wires into the light bulb back into the one positive,through it through the wires into the light bulb back into thepositive
5558,yeah,yeah
5559,like if everybody got the same answer it might've taken a longer time to test out this experiment,like if everybody got the same answer it might have taken a longer time to test out this experiment
5560,well um that's just kind of how she told us to set it up,well um the just kind of how she told
5561,like if i said if i was going one two three and i was doing it like maybe by myself then um i may've miscounted one and that would mess up the whole experiment,like if i said if i was going one two three and i was doing it like maybe by myself then um i made ave miss counted one and that would miss up the whole
5562,but it are you asking me like where it's set up,but it iyou asking me like where it's set up
5563,well if you like do it i guess if you kind of today uh we're gonna do it outside um,well if you like do it i guess if you kind of today um we're gongna do it outside um
5564,n mmm as long it's as long a it's the string is tight and the plane is on mmm hmm,m as long it's as long as it's the string is tight and the plate is ot
5565,uh mmm cause i think we're gonna do one at a time mmm a ca and uh each table group is a different variable so that kinda covers it i guess we could try that,uh cause i think we're gonna do i when at a time  at and uh each table group is a different variable so that kindaf coveres it i guess we could tryth
5566,to if everyone was doing like the same variable it would take a longer time to do the experiment if everybody did the same variable and there's so many variables so i guess it's uh,til if everyone wis doing like the same variable it would take a longer time to do the experiment if everybody did the same variable and there so many variables so i guess so
5567,mmm hmm like um we have rubber bands and some people are gonna do like three rubber bands and they think that it'll be in less lines for the propeller,mm hmm like um we have rubber bands and some people are goinna do like three rubber bands and they think that it'll be in less winds for the propeller
5568,yeah yeah mmm hmm i know,yeah yeah mm hmm i know
5569,we're expecting it to um make like maybe a twenty maybe like in twenty spins for the propeller since the fan is helping it push maybe that'll help,we're expecting it to um make like maybe and twenty maybe unlike and twenty spins for the propeller since the fan is helping it push maybe that'll help
5570,um like what do you mean,um like wouldn't you me
5571,sorry what,sorry
5572,sorry um i guess to get different answers for each one,sorry um i guess to get different answers for each one
5573,yeah,yeah
5574,like,like
5575,then we wind it up and we test all of our variables,then we wind it up and we testis
5576,we're gonna do that today though,we're gonna do that today
5577,cause that will everybody wants a different answer,cause that will everybody wants a different answer
5578,i'm kind of still wondering why it goes to the side and why the pennies just obviously we pu we tried to put it in the middle but then they like go to the side,i'm kind of still lundering hy it goes to the side and why the penniy's just vously we p we trie to put it in the middle but then th go to the side
5579,well i i wasn't here for yesterday like i told you so if they did science,well i i wasn't here for yesterday like i told you so if they did science
5580,the milliliters we had to see how much water could fit in our cup three centimeters,the milliliters we had to see how much water could fit in our cup three centimeters
5581,five inches,five inches
5582,well um we w first of all everybody did a thirty eight centimeter wait no everybody did three centimeters of a cup and they cut off the rest,well um we w first of all everybody did at thirty eight centim meter we know everybody did three centimeters of a cup and they cut off the rest
5583,um we did um how boats float,um we did um how boats float
5584,a sandwich,a sandwich
5585,well i think this one can hold more water,well i think this one can hold more water
5586,one more time,na
5587,that like the,that like the
5588,yeah,yeah
5589,the height,the height
5590,i feel like a superstar like i already knew that no i'm kidding,ifel like a super star lk i already knew that noing canning
5591,fifty s a hundred and three and fifty six,fifty sa hundred other  and fifty sex
5592,well it's basically the mass and how much the lifeboat boat can hold,well it's basically the mass and how much the lefft coat boat can hold
5593,so this one holds more water so i'm guess well i'm not what i found out is it also holds more pennies as well and this one holds less water and it also holds less pennies,so this one holds more water so i'm guess well i'm n what i found out was it also holds more pennies as well and this one holds less water and it also holds less pennies
5594,i can't really remember,i can't really remember
5595,um good we got more than the ones that just stayed in the corner and started to sink to the side and,um good we got more than the ones that just stayed in the corner and started t sank to the side and
5596,um well w there wasn't that many other than the height and the mass those were the only very big variables and we we didn't really do any more,um well w l there wasn't that many other than the height and the mass those were the only vary big variables and we we didn't really do anymore
5597,yeah,yeah
5598,maybe,maybe
5599,well this one holds more,well an this one holds more
5600,is this thing on right,i is ton
5601,oh um well i think the difference is that if you already have the pennies where you wanna place them then the mass is like um it's like not as big sorta,oh um well i thin the difference is that if you already have the pennies where yo want no place them then the mass is like um it's like not as big sart af
5602,and we got it up to fifty,and we got it up to fifty
5603,is there like something i can hear myself in,is there like something i can hear myself in ye
5604,i guess the higher one might sink faster,i guess the higher one might sink faster
5605,well we we just placed the pennies in all different corners,well we we just placed the pennies in all different corners
5606,e i think i did it wrong because i think i started i think i started the right way but then i thought i had to do it down here so,i i think i did it wrong because i think i started i think i started the right way but then i thought i had to do i down here so
5607,i guess it if everybody would just go one two or one two three four the the whole thing wouldn't be like that anymore,i guess i if everybody would just go one two or one two three four the the whole thing wouldn't be like that anymore
5608,say that was twenty five and then for two fifteen i would i would i would probably end up,say that was twenty five and then for two fifteen i would i would i would probably end up
5609,um yes but um our teacher had us count all together like like i have shown you the whole cycle,um yes but um our teacher had us count all together like like i have showen you the whole cycle
5610,yes even the two hundred fifteen the hundred the ninety five the me,yes even the two hundred fifteen the hundred the ninety five the mea
5611,sorry,
5612,mmm the two fifteen would make about,u h the ten fifteen would make about
5613,yeah,yeah
5614,yeah,yeah
5615,um i for the thirty eight or the different length,um i for the thirty eight or the different lengths
5616,the shorter swings uh swing more times than the um longer ones,the shorter swings ah swing more times than the um longer ones
5617,you would probably get seventeen,it wouldprobably get seventeen
5618,yeah,yeah
5619,yeah,yeah
5620,the numbers of the s your your swings and then these numbers are the number of your length,the numbers of the syrger swings and then these numbers are the number of your length
5621,and the the two hundred and fifteen string with the paper clip and a penny it got five,and the the two hundred and fifteen string with a paper clip and depending it got five
5622,so like the uh with one penny the two hundred and fifteen would still get five,so like the uh with one penny the two hundred fifteen would still get five
5623,yeah,yeah
5624,well we did try um i think two days ago uh everybody got a different um length and then she gave us the two more pennies and um that didn't seem to change,well we did try um i think two days ago uh everybody got a different um length and then she gave us the two more pennies and um that didn't seem to change
5625,and then,and then
5626,thirty eight,thirty eight
5627,you would you would find your length cause everybody got their own and you would first find yours so for mine,you would you would find your length cause everybody got their own and you would first find yours so permine
5628,um i guess we just i i don't really understand the question,um i guess we just i i don't realy understand the question
5629,all the way up to twenty five and it was a graph like this,all the way up to twenty five and it was a graph like this
5630,right right mmm hmm,right right
5631,or,or
5632,can i hear mys,kay hermi
5633,um sorry,um sorry
5634,that well the two hun and fifteen was dangling from here kinda just going like this and then mine was going,that well the two hundr and fifteen was stayinging from here kind just go ing like this and then mine was going
5635,how many swings you've gotten and then on this side you would write down your length and how many swings you got,how many swings you have gotten and then on this side you would write down your length and how many shings you got
5636,so if that was the length then,so if that was the length then
5637,yes,yes
5638,um we've been working with swingers um a pendulum,um we've been working with swingers um a pendulum
5639,like um our flip stick is a popsicle stick and there's six centimeters on it until these two come in so it's like one two three four five six,like um our flobstick is the popsicle stick and there's six centimeters on it until these two come ins so it's like one to three four five six
5640,cause that's the only way you can get your result,cause that's only wayking i yu result
5641,for each inch so like for six inches we did four times and then we divided it by four cause we did it four times and then we got our results,four each inch so like for six inches we did four times and then we divided it by four cause we did it four times and then we got our results
5642,yeah yeah everybody does four trials on each centimeter,yeah yeah everybody does four trils on each centimeter
5643,oh oh we most of the time we make it hit to the like this part all the way down to the the next,oh oh we most of the time we make it hit to the like this part all the way down to the the next
5644,twenty,twenty
5645,by four,by four
5646,the more far it's out it go the aluminum ball goes higher as in like it uh that we're we're having a measuring tape and sometimes it goes higher than the limit,a more far it's out it'd go the aluminum ba hal goes higher as in like i um that we're we're having a measuring tape and sometimes it goes higher than the limite
5647,yeah um like we kinda did two variables but it's coming together as one so we're seeing how far in or out the stick is and how it affects the ball,yeah um like we kinda did two variables but it's coming together as one so we're seeing how far in or out the stick is and how it affects the ball
5648,yeah,yeah
5649,it's like um it's how far the stick is so total the stick is total six inches so we keep pushing it in and in in more and more,it's like um it's how far the stick is so total the stick is total six inches so we keep pushing it in and tin ind more and more
5650,well because the weight if it's like forty centimeters it'll definitely change everything but ten and twenty aren't that far away but if it was like forty from ten that would make a huge difference,well because the weight if it's like forty centimeters it 'lld definly change everything but ten and twenty aren't that far away but if it was like forty from ten that would make a huge difference

6667,it's showing how it's water is eroding away one spot and then it's the depositions ending up in the middle of the river and it's forming an alluvial fan,it's showing how it's water is eroding away one spot and then it's the depositions ending up in the middle of the river and it's forming an aluvial fan
6668,it's because it's showing that highlighted part is showing deposition in the stream table,it's because it's showing that highlighted part is showing deposition in the stream table
6669,oh this is deposition,oh this is deposition
6670,it shows little movement because in the deposition area it shows little movement because the deposition is making like the river tinier and then it goes slower and yeah,it shows little movement because in the deposition ara it shows little movement because e deposition is making like the river tinyer and then it goes sloweryeawn
6671,by deposition and erosion,by deposition and erosion
6672,these are created by erosion,these are created by erosion
6673,when water's gone through it and eroded and eroded away all the rock to make a really big valley,when water's gon through it and eroded and eroded away all the rock to make a really big valey
6674,valleys are created by erosion which is tiny particles being taken off of something and then just floating away,valees are created by erosion which is tiny particles being taken off of something and then just floating away
6675,that would mean that erosion was happening here,that would mean that erosion was happening here
6676,by i mean by erosion,by deposite i mean by erosion

7381,so the one on the left has all those,so the one on the left has all those o tem
7382,it is dissolving and an never comes back,it is disvolving and it never comes back
7383,think the jelly beans on the left is called a mixture and one on the rigth are not mixture at all,the jelly beans on the left is called a mixture and the ones on the right are not mixtured at all
7384,it changed because you put him you,they changed because you put em
7385,the,the salt
7386,so you mix water any put and now open the and you pour it in the water change out put some marble stay,so you mixed the marble with water cand you put in it over the bol and you pour it in the water jrains out but the marble stay
7387,it is dissolving into other things,it is dissolving into other things
7388,it is dissolving,it is diolveing
7389,that the when the salt when you pour water in the salt it disappears and not disclosing make sure but you don't know it just looks like clean water in that in the water looks like get started,that the when the salt when you pour water in the salt it disappears and that's called a mixture but you don't know it just looks like plean water in the dirt and the water looks like that the dirt didn't get start up
7390,no because it is mixed in there and when you drink it he does not come out,no because it is mixed in there and when you drink it it does not come out
7391,it is the different mixture because it is dissolving and to a different thing with the motor,i ise a different mixture because it is disvolving into a different thing with the gravel and water
7392,it is dissolving into other things,it is dissolving into other things
7393,it has separated and the,it has separated and tha
7394,the,that
7395,i've been learning about mixtures,i've been learning about mixtures
7396,its not mixture anymore,it's not mixtured anymore
7397,it was mixture but now you have separated everything there is only one is mixture,it was mixtured but now you have separated everything to where there 'is only one pile that is mixtured

7401,good how are you,good how are you
7402,that when you pour water and the salt it exhaust and disappears,that when you pour water in the salt it dissolves and disappears
7403,yes,yes
7404,to dissolving into other things like material,dissolving into other things like material
7405,that it has treated from being a mixture,that it hascerated from being a mixture
7406,its called dissolving,it's caled dissolving
7407,it is something otherwise that will never come back,it is something otherwise that will never come back
7408,i'm put the sand and you pour the water sand in there and all the water turned out in the sand the filtered was in the filter,put the sand and you poured the water and sand in there and all the water strained out and the sand the dirt was in the filter
7409,well it looks like it looks like that there was,it looks like it looks like that theyres
7410,its importnat because we are separating the stuff and because so we know what mixture,it's important because we are separating the stuff and because so we know what mixtures e
7411,that when two are more things are put together its called a mixture,that when two or more things are a put together it's called a mixture
7412,and use there is no way the you think it get back,iis disvolving thevo thing and  there's no way that you can get it back

7686,what did you say oh wait let me repeat you let me let me can i move my bar please no,hwhat did you say owat lme repeat you et me let me can i move my bab please no
7687,we've been doing water,we've been doing
7688,the salt is saturated in the water,the salt is saturated in theter
7689,well we've been trying to saturate salt in water so we put fifty millimeters of water in a cup and then we added as much salt as we could until it couldn't evaporate,uhwell we've been trying to saturate salt in water so we put fifty millimeters of water in a cup and then we added as much salt as we could until it couldn't evaporate
7690,it's saturated asked you like the same question do you have to ask the same question,it's saturated d at'uld you like the same question do you have to ask the same question
7691,that it's saturated,that it's saturated
7692,the sugar isn't dissolving and that means that it dissolves better than the epsom salt,the sugar isn't dissolving and that means it dissolves better than the epsom salt
7693,the fifty millimeters of water is heavier because they added salt and the other fifty milliliters of water doesn't have any salt and there's nothing else in it so it's just water and they both have,ifty the fifty millimeters of water is heavier because they added salt and the otherty milliters doesn't have any salt and there's nothing else in it so it's just water and they both have
7694,not hi how are you,not hi um how are you
7695,by using weights,by using weights
7696,the salt and the water and that the salt at the bottom is saturated because the water can't dissolve any more salt and that means that there's too much salt in the water,the salt and the water and that the the salt at the bottom is saturated because the water can't dissolve anymore salt and that means there's too much salt in the water
7697,the sugar heads to the bottom,the sugar heads to the bottom
7698,so the water with fifty millimeters is saturated which means there's too much salt for it to dissolve so it can't dissolve anymore so the salt that's not dissolving is at the bottom,so the water which fifty millimeters is saturated which means there's too much salt for it to dissolve so it can't dissolve anymore so the salt that's not dissolving is at the botom
7699,well the water is saturated which it means it can't it can't dissolve anymore salt because that means it's saturated and it has too much water i mean salt into the water so it's not so it's not gonna dissolve and then yeah and so it's saturated so they,well the water is saturated which it means it ca it can't dissove anymore salt because that means hat's saturated ad it has too much water i mean salt into the water so it's not so it's not gong tossolve an then and so is saturated so
7700,that means it's saturated salt,that means it's saturated s
7701,you weighed it with the weight,you weighed it with the weight
7702,you made it heavier by putting the salt in the water and you just had so you had the same amount of water which they weighed the same so if you put salt in the other one that makes it heavier and if you didn't put any salt in the other one then it's gonna be the same,you made it heavier by putting the sat in the water and you just had so you had the same amount of water which they weighed the same so if you put salt in the other one that makes it heavier and if you didn't put any salt in the other one then it's going a be the sames
7703,the salt solution and the water so the the the water has salt in it so that means it's heavier and the one the,the sell solution and the water so the the water has salt in it so that means it's heavier and the one the
7704,it's sixty seven grams because you used the weights to measure it and then you would count how many weights,it's sixty seven grams because you use the weights to measure it and then you an count how many weighs
7705,and it it you guys are measuring the water that and then and and it's sixty,your guis ar measuring the water that and ten and it's sixty

8414,smells like gas because um it's uh it's a smell energy and it smells really bad because it's dust,smells like gas because it's ait's a smell energy and its smells really bad because it's guas
8415,the an apple and three apples and a solar pan,tean apple n three apples and a solar pen
8416,can you repeat that,can you repeat that
8417,it it didn't sound much it just went the wax melted and dropped i heard that but it doesn't make,it it din't sound much it just when the wax melted and dropped i heard that but it doesn't make
8418,the apple and her feet,the apple and her feets
8419,that um the they both have a they both use a battery and they both need the sunlight or heat lights in order for them to work,that th they both have they both use a battery and they both need the sunlights or keep lights in order for them to work
8420,you're giving our your energy because you're going you're getting it all focused on the sound and how you want it,you're giving out your energy because you're you're getting it all focuse on the sounds and how you want it
8421,i see three apples um like a little desk a candle two logs and gas,i see three apples umlike little desk a candle two logs and a gas
8422,no,no

8435,because you let me go what you were talking and i am,good because you let me go where you were talking and
8436,the ethylene work anymore because it's like already dried out and start,the it doesn't work anymore because it's like already dried out and stuff
8437,that's reason,ask me the
8438,it's not working anymore,it's not working anymore
8439,these wires hold like energy and stuff,wires holds like energy and stuff
8440,it will work may be,it won't work maybe
8441,light bulb broke and it doesn't,light bulb broke and it dosn't
8442,no body and can i put to use just with what is,omarni and could i please usi
8443,because it doesn't work,cause it doesn't work
8444,because the switch is,because the switch is out
8445,it breaks,it breaks
8446,i see that light bulb is not working because the switch is in on is like holding the electricity is going through light bulb,i see that the light bulb is not working because the switch is nt on s like holding the electricityfor going through the light bul
8447,i noticed that it doesn't work anymore because one of the light bulbs,i've noticed that it doesn't work anymore because one of the light bulbs
8448,series circuit,rcircit
8449,we really it doesn't work anymore because like well what are light bulbs does work but the other one,it doesn't work anymore because like well one of the light bulbs does work but the other oul
8450,we had seen a series circuit and a parallel circuit,e seen a series circuit and a parallel
8451,light is,string ligh is
8452,i will not know actually,i do not know actually
8453,it will work anymore because it's like that strategies hold back,el it won't work anymore because it's like like  the energy is hold fack
8454,because the switch is in because the switch is in there,because the switch ist because the switch isn' there
8455,to that current stops,ti the curnt stops
8456,i don't know,i don't know
8457,a series,a serie
8458,i think that the battery,i think that the battery
8459,may it doesn't work or really the other one doesn't work,maybe it doesn't work or  other one doesn't work
8460,a parallel circuit,a parallel circuit
8461,i don't know,i don't know
8462,light bulb grow so it doesn't work so that it has to be different another,thbulb broke so it didn't work so they n it has to change nfrnt of them
8463,may be because it's getting too much light,maybe because it's getting too much light
8464,you know that is,no w thata
8465,we know that there is a battery that this three wires there is a switch,we know that there'is a battery d that there's three wires is the switch
8466,i don't know,i don't know
8467,of the battery,thers o the battery
8468,that one of the light bulbs broke,that one of the light bulbs broke
8469,the light the two light bulbs are lighting because the other one is broken and then what they do what they will was it doesn't work,doit the light the two light bulbs are lighting because the other one is broken and then what they dow what they do wh it doesn't work
8470,there were the light bulbs were lighting but there is the other one broke as they did a stuff light i get that they got it other one and it started lighting and that,they were the light bulbs were lighting but then the other one broke and they did s stop lighting and the they got ather one and it started lighting m yet
8471,break,breiht
8472,bulb starts working because like with the switch was out it was hold that energy from the light bulb,b starts working because like when the switch was out it was holding the energy back from the light bulb
8473,work anymore because it's standard is doesn't work,don't work anymore because it's stead ad it's doesn't work
8474,it's not a complete circuit,is not a complete circuit
8475,the flow the electricity is going through all three wires,the flow the electricity is going to all the three wires
8476,there is a switch for a new one,the ing a switche for a new one
8477,any more this can no light getting,oreand there's no ight et it
8478,any more,the more
8479,would you speak a light is party,what a strialight is marni
8480,series circuit,series circuit
8481,see that i had received a parallel circuit a series circuit,see thei've seen a parallel circuit a series circuit and
8482,we've been learning how to complete a circuit,we've been learning how to complete circuit
8483,so,so
8484,insulators are helpful,insulators are are healpthu
8485,its starts to move because it's like like happy its energy,it starts to move because it's like like happy it's getting energy
8486,i see that the motor is moving because when i put the paper clip on top of the switch it started to move,i see that the motor is moving because when i put the paper clip on top of the switch it started to move
8487,because it's not a source of electricity or a piece of energy,because it's not a source of lectricity or a piece of energy
8488,good,good
8489,the motor is moving its little flag because the switch is turned on,the motor is moving its little flag because the switch is turned on
8490,the circuit will run because it is like its metal and in order for it towards that needs metal,the circuit will run because it's like it's metal and in order for it to work it needs metal
8491,all inside it and then it want,inside it and then it won't
8492,i mean that is not getting energy because the switch is at on and the wood stick is like isn't a type of metal so it won't work,it means that it's not getting energy because the switch isn't on and the wood stick is like isn't a type of metal so it it won't work
8493,conducting materials are helpful but the rest of that aren't where it's to other way over can you tell that marnie,conducting materials or help fe but the rest of them aren't or it's the other way around can you tell me that marnie
8494,that when you put the wood on the wood stick it is not working anymore because it's not type of metal or its type of source to make it,that when you put the wood wood the wood stick it isn't working anymore because it's not a type of metal or type of source to make it
8495,it doesn't work because it's not like store of energy and because a battery works because that has stored energy inside it so,it doesn't work because it's not asor of energy and because a battery works because it has tore energy inside it so
8496,i said that you need a battery which has stored energy inside it and then you need two wires a switch and a motor,i said that you need a battery which has stoled energy inside it and then you need two wires a switch and a motor
8497,well i think that the light the dots are the energy and like that's was just speaking the light bulb brighter,well i think that the like the dots are the energy and like that's what's making the light bulb brighter
8498,it's just to be in a circle is very helpful because they has because the battery is giving in energy to the d cell that's how the light bulb is getting the energy improvement,electricity in a circuit is very helpful because it has because it the batteryis giving energy to the d cell and that's ow the thog light bulb is getting the energy and brt
8499,i don't know,i don't know
8500,that when those one light bulb it just one focus and like when there is a one battery it doesn't light as much as the second one because there is two for each one,at when there's one light bulb it's just one fokas and like when there's one battery it doesn't light as much as the second one because there's two for each one
8501,its it was the light bulbs turn brighter because it's using two batteries and so that is two stored energies into light bulbs,it's  it was the light bulbs turned brighter because it's using two batteries and so the is two stored energys in two light bulbs
8502,there are one two three four there is four path ways to a series circuit,there are one two three four there's four pathways to a serious circuit
8503,i think the work may be,i think it work maybe
8504,the energy stored in that because it's giving energy to the light bulbs,the energy is stored and stuff because it's giving energy to the light bulbs
8505,i think the light bulbs are going to be brighter because it's using to tube a d cells and like they have stored energy so it will work,i think the light bulbs are gonto be brighter because it's using to to  d cells and like they have sort of energy so it wi work
8506,can you repeat that,can you breat
8507,flow in like the battery and it has to has to go through the light bulb the wires the d cell as to go through light has to go through it has lot of things,flow in like the battery and it has to g through it has to go through the light bulb the wires the d cell t has to go through ight it has to go through air it has t go through a lot of things
8508,i think that is the wire is getting energy and its going into the light bulbs so the little blue dots are like the energy coming,i think that is the the wire's getting energy and it's going into the light bulbs so the little blue dots are like the energy coming
8509,it's to be touching d cell and the wires because the wires are going to gain energy and by that one is going to be like a really fun and stuff like that so just get on the last part,s to be touching d cell and the wires because the wires are gong na help it get  energy and y to oit's gongnto be like really fun and stuff i guess i just guessed on the less part
8510,because they needs another wire connecting to the plus of the wires and there are not supposed to be touching,because it needs another wire connecting to the plus of the wires and they dare't supposed to be touching
8511,connecting the series circuit like it would not be the bright anymore well it will be bright because it's only used i think it won't work and i think really work light bulbs,k the series circuit like it  it would not be that bright anymore will it will be bright because it's only use i think it won't work and it will will work but the light bulb won't
8512,may be because if the wires are the battery is giving energy to the wire and that's why the light bulb is shining and its very very very very bright,maybe because if the wires are the battery's giving energy to the wire and that's why the light bulb is shining and it's very very very very bright
8513,he is a complete format for a light bulb to work,it is a complete format for a light bulb to work
8514,it's like the energy is giving the energy it's called to the light bulb and that's how its giving energy i guess,it's like the energy is giving the energy it's got to the light bulb and that's how it's doing energy i guess
8515,that the energy flowing,the the energy is flowing

8819,like what,like what
8820,yeah,ye
8821,when i clipped on the batteries,when i clicked on the batteries
8822,it tells me the bulbs are lighting up because of the energy flo is flo,it tells me the bobs are lighting up because of the energy fisf
8823,why is that your favorite question,why is that your favorit  question
8824,what else do you want to know,what'll seyeu one
8825,um hmm that's a hard question um it it can on like i said it can only flow from the negative to the positive,um  that's a hard question um it it can only like a sid it can only flow from the negative to the positive
8826,we put two batteries on two bulbs,we put two batteries on two bobs
8827,no but i know it's flowing cause the bulbs are lighting up,no but i know ite flung cause the bulbs are ligning up
8828,hmm we tried to light um a bulb two bulbs with one battery,we tried to light ha bulb two bulbs with one battery
8829,it light dimly,it lick  dily

8986,i'm sorry marney um but i just haven't told that i need to go back to my class but i'll see you next time,soary marnie um but i just have been told that i need to go back to my class but i'll see you next time
8987,yes,yes
8988,nineteen,nineteen
8989,is talking about how many washers it took to break the force of the magnet,it's talking about how many washers it took to break the force of the magnet
8990,um we used a manage pushed a magnet in plastic cups and um plastic spacers and washers,um we used a magnag post uh magnet and plastic cups and um plastic spacers and washers
8991,bye marney,bye marnie
8992,can you please repeat that,l you please repeat that
8993,good,kood
8994,the magnet's force,the magnets force
8995,okay,
8996,what do you mean,what do you mean
8997,i've been seeing how much weight it takes it er you need to break the force,i've been seeing how much weight takes it or you need to break the force
8998,and we used a um measure to um we put one,um  used uh um measure to um we put one
8999,i think it was,i think it was
9000,it's a graph and we can mark it to um the magnet finally um o um just couldn't take it,it's a graph and we can mark it to the um the magnet finally um  um just couldn't take it
9001,at m maybe on our board,at  maybe on our board
9002,well i it broke because under the weight um it kept getting um heavier and heavier,well  it broke because under the weight um it kept getting um heavier and heavier
9003,um as i put in more washers the force from the magnet is getting weaker and weaker until it finally breaks,um as i put in more washers the force from the magnet is getting weaker and weaker until it finally breaks
9004,good,good
9005,the washers made it really heavy and the scale turned the other way towards the washers,the washers made it really heavy and the scale turned the other way towards the washers

9011,it is um charging the motor so the motor goes and that's pretty much it,it is um charging the motor so the motor goes and that's pretty much it
9012,the d ce cell is a energy disputer which um send which the ener which sends energy through the wires,the d ci cell is the energy desputer which um send which the  which sends the energy through the wires
9013,well the symbol for the battery one side is one line is a little big longer so that probably means that it's the um positive side and the other side is shorter so it probaby means the negative sign,well the symbl for the battery one side is one line is a littl bit longer so that probably means that it's the um positive side and the other side is shorter so it probably means the negative sin
9014,those are the wires which the energy travels through to make the motor start,those are the wires which the energy travels through to make the motor start

9018,um well it charges things,um well it charges things
9019,if they weren't n um next to the m for the motor or the d cell symbol then it wouldn't run,if they weren't um next to the m for the motor or the d cell symbol then it wouldn't run
9020,pretty good,pretty good
9021,you have to make it in a s sort of in a circle or else th it won't flow correctly,you have to make it in a s sort of in a circle or else the it won't flow correctly
9022,the electricity has to um not be it has to run out for it to,um actually it has to
9023,if you turn it if you by the switch then it sort of turns the electromagnet on sort of like a light bulb,if you turn it if you cy the switch then it's sort of turns the electromagnet on sort of like a light bulb
9024,it is closed,it is closed
9025,then it will work,then it will work

9032,it cuts it off,it cuts it off
9033,i have to go marnie,i have to go marnie
9034,well,the electricity has to be flowing around or else the energy won't reach um the magnet so it won't work

9036,temporary magnets don't last very long,temporary magnets don't last very long
9037,you can make an electromagnet,you can make an electromagnet
9038,well um you're really um good about talking s um clearly and but you kind of but you're still a little bit choppy,well um you're really um good about talking s um clearly and but you're kind but you're still a little bit choppy
9039,um we added more well we had spacers and washers as you know and we put the spacers between the magnets and the washers on the other end,um we added more well we had spacers and washers as you know and we put the spacers between the magnets and the washers on the other and
9040,it has too many washers so that the magnets lose their magnetic field,it has too many washers so that the magnets loe their magnetic field
9041,we um group a group b and group d have the same results cause they probably did the same thing and group c has really low um,um group a group b and group d have the same result cause they probably did the same thing and group c has really low um
9042,getting further apart,'getting further apart
9043,well they had better um,well they had better um
9044,yeah because there was such a big drop like from nineteen nine that's ten washers so th the spacers must have a a lot of use,yeah because it was such a big drop like from ninetteen to nine that's ten  washers so the sspacers must ave had l a lot of use
9045,they're sticking together,they're sticking together
9046,i'm good,i'm good
9047,yeah they're really fun especially the messy ones,yeah they're really fun especially the mussy ones
9048,we have been um we have been testing the strength of the magnets,we have been um we have been testing the strength of magnets
9049,magnets get further apart because the more um spacers you put in between the um less room they have,magnets get further apart because the more um spacers you put in between the um  less room they have
9050,they should do the same things,they should do the same things
9051,washers were heavy and they made the magnets lose their strength,washers were heavy and they made the magnets lose their strength
9052,yeah because then it would kind of um hit the cup and then the magnets would kind of separate because of the force and then they would come back together,yeah because then it would kind of um hit the cup and then the magnets would kind of separate because of the force and then they would come back together
9053,it's broken because um the washer's thrown in there so hard that it kind of forces that cup down and the other cup to come with the magnet to separate from the other magnet,it's broken because um the washer is thrown in they're so hard that it kind of forces that cup down and the other cup to come u with the magnet to separate from the other magnet
9054,the magnetic the magnets get weaker and weaker as the washers get as the more washers get in the other cup,the magnetic the magnets get weaker and weaker as the washers get as mthe more washers get in the other cup
9055,c didn't,c and
9056,you need to follow the directions or whatever you're being told to do correctly or else you'll get really different results,you need to follow the directions or whatever you're being toled to do correctly or else you'll get really different results
9057,if you don't follow the directions or whatever then you won't get the same results as maybe the other people who are doing it right,if you don't fallow the directions or whatever then you on't get the same result as maybe the other people who are doing it right
9058,i answered that already,i answered that already
9059,well the there's the base the wire the c d cell or the source and the light bulb the receiver and the wire the pathway,well the there's the base the wire the s d cell or the source and the light bulb there's  and the wire's the pathway
9060,the d cell um is the energy part um the wire carries the energy to the light bulb and the light bulb makes the electricity,the d cell um is the energy part um the ire air carries the energy to the light bulb and the light bulb makes the electricity
9061,well they attach to the magn to i mean to the um,
9062,i see a d cell a light bulb um really small light bulb and some wire,i see a d cell a light bulb a really small light bulb and some wire
9063,pretty good,pretty good
9064,i it's kind of like a root,i it's kind of like a rouot
9065,well today we um we made an electromagnet and a lot most of our class got electricity,well today we um we made an electromagnet and a lot most of our class got electricity
9066,it's the um energy source that travels through the wire to create the electricity,it's the um energy source that travels through the wire to create the elelectricity
9067,um there are only two,um the're only two
9068,then uh the other one will burn out as well as the other one,then the other one will burn out as well as the other one
9069,then they all burn out sort of like how uh um bunch of houses i if one light if one house burns out and if it's and it's a series circuit then all of the houses will burn out,then they all burn out sort of like how a um bunch of houses if one ligkhet if one house burns out and if it's and it's a series circuit then all the houses will burn out

9073,one is a series circuit and another is a parallel circuit,one is a series circuit and another is a parallel circuit
9074,um it has to travel through both light bulbs before it gets back to the battery,um it has to travel through both light bulbs before it gets back to the battery
9075,um it's important because if one light bulb burns out then it doesn't affect the other light bulb,um it's important because if one light bulb burns out then it doesn't affect the other light bulb
9076,well the pathways are pretty much sort of two pathways because um they go through one light bulb instead of having to travel through the whole um circuit,well the pathways are pretty much sort of two pathways because um they go through one light bulb instead of having to travel through the whole um circuit
9077,the one on the right side is sort of separate from the other one,the one on the right side is sort of separate from the other one
9078,today we made electromagnets but ours didn't work,today we made electromagnets but ours didn't work
9079,a parallel circuit,a parallel circuit
9080,um the light bulb on the right is burned out,um the light bulb on the right is burned out
9081,well one thing is that this is a probably a parallel circuit because when i clicked on one of the light bulbs the other one didn't burn out,well one thing is that this is a probably a parallel circuit because when i clicked on one of the light bulbs the other one didn't burn out
9082,today we made electromagnets but ours didn't work probably because we had a dead battery,today we made electromagnets but ours didn't work probably because we had a dead battery
9083,if one of the light bulbs burn out oh then um none of the light bulbs will light up,if one of the light bulbs burn out then um none of the light bulbs will light up
9084,um it is a series circuit so the light bulbs didn't burn very bright,um it was a series circuit so the light bulbs didn't burn very bright
9085,yes i have,yes i have
9086,then the energy can't flow through to the to the light bulb so um the light bulb cannot light up,then the energy can't flow through thoh to the light bulb so um the light bulb cannot light up

9097,the electricity doesn't have to pass through another bulb it can just go straight back to the battery so it is very good,the electricity doesn't have to pass through another bulb it can just go straight back to the battery so it is very good
9098,um there are two,um there are two
9099,hi marnie,hi marnie
9100,yeah,yeah
9101,the,they
9102,well actually they only have one energy source because that is the d cell but they have two different wires that connect to the d cell so they can both light up the exact same amount,well actually they only have one energy source because that is the d cell but they have two different wires that connect to the d cell so they can both light up the exact same amount
9103,they are about using one d cell or battery to make two different light bulbs light up,they are about using one d cell or battery to make two different light bulbs light up
9104,yeah that that whe that uh left is the way that uh,ah tha that what that uh left is the way that uh
9105,um well we knew that we'd try the halfway point at twenty first and if that went too far we'd start going lower and then we figured out the halfway point was seventeen,um well we knew that wed tried the half way point at twenty first and if that went too far we'd start going lower and then we figured out the halfway point was seventeen
9106,um you need a certain amount of twist which is forty yeah mmm hmm um the string you have to have it on the string,um you need a certain amount of twist which is forty yeah m hm um the string you have to have it on the string
9107,yeah,yeah
9108,it's sometimes confusing cause we don't know when to change em or when to keep em the same,it's sometimes confusing cause we don't know whend to change em or when to keep tem the same

9115,how far it would go with two passengers and then four passengers and so on,how far it would go with two passengers then four passengers and so on
9116,um maybe the it'd be another speed one but it wouldn't be with the fan it'd be with more propellers,um maybe the it'd be another speed one but it wouldn't be with the fan it'd b with more propellers
9117,uh because it's half of forty,uh because it's half af  forty
9118,uh well because if you change two variables at the same time it might not go out go as well as you predicted it would,uh well because if you changed two variables at the same time it might not go out go as well as you predicted it would

9126,yeah,yeah
9127,um because they knew that it was gonna get a lot more speed with the fan,um because they knew that it was goinna get a lot more speed with the fan
9128,mmm hmm yeah,hm yeah
9129,we wanted to see the halfway point and all the other points on the strings,we wanted to see the halfway point and all the other points on the strings
9130,uh well we tried to we figured out the halfway point and the,uh well we tried to we figured out the halfway point and the
9131,uh well we put it on wrong so or i twisted it wrong and so when i twisted it one way it started going backwards,uh well we put it on wrong so er i twisted it wrong and so when i twisted it one way it started going backwards
9132,yeah mmm hmm,yeah mmmm hm
9133,uh they are like the standard thing that makes it fly or in what you need to make it fly,uh they are like the standard thing that makes it fly ar and what you need to make it fly
9134,yeah,yeah
9135,te,two
9136,mmm that we c um,that realy could um
9137,that it goes backwards when you twist it and right is the way it goes forward yeah yeah,that it goes backwards when you twiste it and right is the way tit goes forward yeah mm ham
9138,uh well because we couldn't really change that s yet and so we just kept it you at the time you could only change one variable and so,uh well because we couldn't really change thats yet and so  we just kept it you at the time you could only change one variable  so
9139,and then our standard was we didn't really have any passengers so when we put more passengers on we changed the variables a lot,and then our standard was we didn't really have any passengers so when we put more passengers on we changed the variables a lot
9140,we changed like one part of the whole standard thing,we changed like one part of the whole standard thing
9141,yeah,yeah
9142,it really just affected it a lot because usually without e with the same amount of weight that it had before it kept it on the same thing,it really just affected it a lot because usually without  with the same amount of weight that it had before it kept it on the same thing
9143,hi,hi
9144,er no it made it not as go not as far,or no it made it not a sgoe not as far
9145,uh well we just used the standard propeller speed,uh well we just used the standard propeller speed
9146,we just ha we had to change the amount of spins for the propeller yeah or else it wouldn't get across at all,we just ha we had to change the amount of spins for the propeller yeah or else it wouldn't get across at all

9148,yeah mmm hmm,yeah m hm
9149,um we spun it eighty times and it got all the way across yeah,um weve spone it eighty times and it got all the way across yeah
9150,um well it if it well there you twist okay there's a couple ways that you can twist it if you twist it one way it'll go backwards and another way it'll go forwards,um well it if it well there you twist okay there's a couple ways that you can twiste it if you twiste it one way it'll go backwards in another way it'll go forwards

9152,uh i love to write and do math,uh i love to right and do math
9153,um yeah,u hm yeah
9154,if you like changed how many propellers or something that was on there it might go farther or faster,if you like changed how many propellers or something that was on there it might go farther or faster
9155,um well those toothpicks it helps hold the propeller in so it'd stay on and won't fall off mmm hmm,um well those touth picks it helps hold the propeller in so it' stay on at won't fall off
9156,hmm i would have to say reading,i would have to say reading
9157,yeah we haven't cha we're gonna like put little paper clips on it,yeah we haven't cha we're gonna like put little paper clips on it

9164,yeah,yeah
9165,i don't really understand how it'd fly i just does it like suck in the a i just don't know if it sucks in the air to make it or pushes out air to make it go,i don't really understand how it'd fly i just does it like suck in the a i just don't know if it sucks in the air to make it or pushes out air to make it go

9177,uh i'm the i have been the best reader in my grades for the past seven years yeah,uh i am the i have been the besst reter and my grades for the past seven years yeah
9178,because the paper clips make it a lot heavier and usually it's just lights and it it'll just fly across but with the paper clips,because the paper clips make it a lot heavier and usually it's just light and it it'll just fly across but with the paper clips
9179,they're like about that big and you hook em onto the plane and we're gonna see how many can get across without making it stop,they're alike about that big and you hook em on to the plane and we're gonnao see how manyy can get across without making it stop
9180,yeah,yeah
9181,yeah,yeah
9182,um well the straws just help it keep it on the strings so that it can fly,um well the straws just help it keep it on the strings so that it can fly

9193,yeah if,yeah if
9194,we um we changed the variables by making the mass of the tin foil squares bigger like we'll go to thirty centimeter tin foil sheets and then so on,we um we changed the variables by making the mass of the ten foil squares bigger like well go to thirty centimeter ten fil sheaeds and then so on
9195,it would go a lot farther cause it has less weight and,it would go a lot farther cause it has less weigh an
9196,uh all the way in yeah is yeah,uh all the way in yeah is yeah
9197,yeah yeah,yeah yeah
9198,it wouldn't you couldn't really compare anything cause your answers to it would be all different and yeah,it wouldn't you couldn't really compare anything cause tyour answers to it would be all different and yeah
9199,it really depended on the place where you had put it cause really if you didn't have it it wouldn't go anywhere,it really depended on the place where you had put it cause really if you didn't have it it wouldn't go anywhere
9200,yeah,yeah
9201,cause uh then it tells you uh more about it and what you're gonna really do in the science project,cause uh h then it tells you a more about it and what you're gonna really do in the science projects
9202,yeah,yeah
9203,ball uh i forgot what it's called yeah or except we made ours square cause it'll stay on the stick better,ball uh i forgot what it's called yeah or except we made our square cause it'll stay on the sticwater

9215,aluminum foil,alumimivore
9216,it would be way off because they would go like across the room and other people would only go maybe like a quarter of the way across the room,it would be way off because they would go like cross the room and other people would only go maybe like a cordr of the way across their home
9217,it's gonna go not as far,it's gonna go not as far
9218,it would probably get m all messed up and wouldn't work just like it was supposed to and just t just stop working after they tried it,it would probably get all messed up and wouldn't work just like it was supposed to and just just stop working after they tried it
9219,uh maybe angle on it and see if we can cha uh,uh maybe angle on it and see if we caun chack uh

9293,well when you don't hook it up right with the wires and the battery and the light bulbs,well when you don't hook it up right with the wires and the battery and the light bulbs
9294,yes,yes
9295,yeah,yeah
9296,well the energy comes from this side into the light bulb,well the energy comes from this side into the light bulb
9297,well we were supposed to use one but our group thought maybe two batteries for two light bulbs but that didn't really work so we took one d cell,well we were suposed to use one but our group thoat maybe two batteries for two light bulbs but that didn't really work so we took one d cel
9298,yeah,yeah
9299,yes sometimes,yes sometimes
9300,yeah,yeah
9301,probably right here,probably right here
9302,yeah kind of we were like uh maybe this isn't the right way to do it,yeah kind of we were like uh maybe this sthe right way to do it
9303,and then this connects to the switch,and then this connects to the switch
9304,yeah,yeah
9305,the switch is working it's a closed circuit when the switch is working and when it's open it's an open circuit and open circuits don't work so when you lift it up it won't work cause it's an open circuit,the switch is working it's a closed circuit when the switch is working and when it's open it's an open circuit and the open circuits don't work so when you lift et up it won't work cause it's an open circuit
9306,and this hooks up to the light bulb chamber,and it sicks up to the light bulb chamber
9307,it's here and that,see yor in the they're one comes o connect
9308,that's a switch and then these are where you connect the wires,that's a switch and then these are whey to connect the wires
9309,i think so maybe,i think so maybe
9310,well,well
9311,okay,okay
9312,well,well
9313,and we probably touched the switch to,ou would probably attach to the switch to
9314,well,well
9315,most of them yeah,most of em yeah
9316,here into the other,her into the other
9317,okay,kay
9318,that having two batteries would be kind of harder since you have two light bulbs it would seem to be easier but because we have two more one more to h battery to handle it's a little bit harder,that having two batteries would be kind of harder since you have two light bulbs sit would seem to be easier but because we have two more one more to  battery to handle it's a littlebit harder
9319,um it's not connected so there's no usually a circuit would go like this it's full,um it's not connected so there's no usually a circuit would go like this it's full
9320,and it goes through,end it goes through
9321,energy and then it goes out,energy and then it goes out
9322,this is the positive side and this is the negative side,this is the positive side and this is the negative side
9323,yeah my teacher did it's parallel circuits well we noticed that the light bulb when it lit up it was dull so parallel circuits i think make them light up more,yeah my teacher did it's parallel circuits well we noticed that the light bulb wouldn't lit up it was dull so parallel circuits i think make them light up more
9324,when you connect it to the light bulb i it has to connect to metal to metal or it won't work,when you connect it to the light bulb it has to connect metal to metal ad it won't work
9325,that parallel can never touch,that parallel can never touch
9326,the switch makes them turn on and off so maybe if you go up or down you could always come back to off or on or,the switch makes them turn on and off so maybe if you go up or down you could always come back to off or on er
9327,nah uh,ah
9328,so the light bulb can get all of it's,so the light bulb can get all of its
9329,because it was kind of too complicated to do it with two cause you had to figure out a special way when with one battery you could do a whole bunch of ways,because it was kind as youe complicated to do it with two cause you had to figure out a special weigh when with one battery u could o hold bunch of ways
9330,the pa negative side of the battery and then this would have the positive side,the pthe negative side of the battery and then this would have the positive side
9331,yeah,yeah
9332,mmm hmm yay,m hm yea
9333,yeah,yeah
9334,yeah,yeah
9335,she could put another bulb in,she could put another bulb in
9336,the light bulb does not light up,the light bulb does not light up
9337,yeah,yeah
9338,only one uh a brother he's in college now though,only one uh a brother he didn't call itch now thog
9339,a parallel circuit is when they never touch so if one bulb goes out it'll just be out and all the others will just keep going because well it's its own little circuit kind of,a parallel circuit is when they never touch so if one bulb goes out it'll just be out and all the others will just keep going because well is it's own little circuit kind of
9340,an open circuit is when um is when maybe if you have a switch in a series circuit and you lift it up it becomes an open circuit and nothing happens,an open circuit is when um is when maybe if you have a switch in a series circuit and you lift it up it becomes an open circuit and nothing happens
9341,well it it stops the whole light from being lighted cause it makes an open circuit,well it it stops the whole lights from being lighted cause it makes an open circuit
9342,parallel,paralle
9343,i think it would go out,i think it would go out
9344,mmm hmm yeah,mm hmm yeah
9345,yes yeah,yes yeah
9346,actually that one would probably well,actually that one would probably well
9347,okay,oh hay
9348,um well it's just like any other light bulb uh the filament would break,um well it's just like any other light bulb uh the filament will break
9349,hello no yeah,well no yeah
9350,so it would come out here and then go through here and then come here and then come through here except there probably wouldn't be enough left after it went through over here,so it would come out here  go through here and theni come here and then come through here except there probably wouldn't be enough left after it went through over here
9351,um they all stopped,um they all stopped
9352,those lights are bright e they're brighter than the series and i think it's because they don't take each other's electricity,those lights are bright they're brighter than the series and i think it's because they don't take each other's electricity
9353,yep,yep
9354,sure,shu
9355,the bulb would just stay light,the bulb would just stay lit
9356,the no,the no
9357,it had way too much electricity and then and then when you reached three it'll just blow up the light bulb,it had weighs too much electricity and then and then when you reach three it'll just blw up te light bulb
9358,and it never it never really actually attaches wires to the other light bulb,and it never it it never really actually attaches wires to the other light bulb
9359,well it would create the electricity to go straight through,well it 'd create the electricity to go straight tthrough
9360,well the lights at first they would go on then when a filament would break it would not be able to all open,well the lights at first they would go on then when a filament would break it would not be able to all open
9361,and then this one would take some of the electricity and then go like this,and then this one would take some of the electricity and then go like this
9362,yeah our teacher told us to do that but we didn't really get the whole thing i yeah how do we wer the people that were making a parallel didn't know exactly how to do that,yeah our teacher told us to do that but we didn't really getup the whole thing i yeah how re we we're the people that we're making a parallel didn't know exactly how to do that
9363,afternoon,afternoon
9364,um well of course the light bulb is probably lighting up most likely of course and well,um well of course the light bulb is probably lighting up most likely of course and well
9365,yeah i think it would be like maybe one circuit and then the other circuit but,yeah i think it would be like maybe one circuit and then the other circuit but
9366,yeah,yeah
9367,yeah,yeah
9368,and then go back into the light bulb to make it go out,and then go back into the light bulb to make o go out
9369,cause they never touch,cause they never touched
9370,electricity,electricity
9371,because it's an open circuit and um it's not attaching t well it's not metal to metal in,because it's an open circuit and um it's not attaching well it's not metal to metal in
9372,um no that's a series,um not lik ha series
9373,circuit yep,circuit yep
9374,yeah that one looks right,yeah that t looks right
9375,yes mmm hmm,yes mm hmm
9376,okay,kay
9377,i,i
9378,yeah,yeah
9379,um there's just not enough electricity to create uh enough for two,um there's just not enough electricity to create uh enough for to
9380,well when you have a light bulb like this one i guess it would be li um the light bulb would,well when you have a light bulb like this one i guess it would be li um the light bulb would
9381,that's is s s the battery d cell,that is the battery d cell
9382,well okay so this would be the pa this would be the positive side and then so it would go through and then into the light bulb and then out back,well okay so this would be the po this would be the positive side and then so it would go through then into the light bulb and then out back
9383,yeah,yeh
9384,it's all stopping and staying,it's all stopping and staying
9385,yeah well it would probably be brighter or the same because it's it's own little circuit so it wouldn't really,yeah well it would probabby be brighter or the same because it's it's a little circuit so it wouldn't really
9386,that'd probably be a parallel mine are that way too,that'd probably be a parallel mine aren't that weight too
9387,yeah um almost ten,yeah um almost ten
9388,these aren't working,these are't working
9389,because when you press it down metal to metal it just goes straight through all the way to the light bulb,because when you press it down metal to metal it just goes straight through all the way to the light bulb
9390,i don't know,i don't know
9391,well we want to make a parallel circuit,well we want to make a parallel circuit
9392,yeah,yeah
9393,except when we tried um putting two d cells together um positive side to positive or negative side just putting them together,except when we tried um putting two d cells together um positive side to positive or negative side just putting them together
9394,that would probably i don't know well,i don't wan probably i don't know well
9395,yeah,yeah
9396,yeah,yeah
9397,no but we thought about it and then we decided to and they probably are doing it right now,no but we thought about it and then we decided to and they probably are doing it right now
9398,complete the flow,complete the floaw
9399,well,well
9400,yeah,yeah
9401,yeah,ye h  h
9402,yes,yes
9403,hello,i don'tt
9404,okay,kay
9405,well,well
9406,yeah,yeah
9407,um yeah that looks about right,um yeah f it looks about right
9408,the battery um creates the electricity to the flow,the battery um creates the electricity to the flow
9409,yeah,yeah
9410,yeah,yeah
9411,he goes to front range in fort collins,he goes to front ragin for coloms
9412,i would tell here that the lights did not burn out it's just one of them burned out and created an open circuit to make it as the electricity wouldn't flow through,i would tell her that the lights did not burn out it's just one of them burned out and created an open circuit to make it as the electricity wouldn't flow through
9413,um you would have a battery,um you would have a battery
9414,um it got brighter i think it even go brighter than the parallel circuit,um it got brighter i think it even got brighter than the parallel circuit
9415,april twenty fourth,aiht pol twenty fourth
9416,yeah,yeah
9417,but i think i have an idea mmm well that's like a series but,but i think i have an idea  m that's like a series but
9418,mmm yeah,yeah
9419,well when you have,well when you have
9420,yeah he comes to town every weekend,yeah and comes down every week and
9421,yes in the series circuit that i made we had very dull light bulbs so,yes in the series circuit that i made we had very dull light bulbs so
9422,normally on a series i think i don't know either,marmily on a series i think a miter
9423,mmm hmm um the light bulb doesn't light up,mm hm um the light bulb doesn't light up
9424,yeah,yeah
9425,um the more wraps you you do around the rivet makes it so that it's stronger and maybe it keeps like a lot of energy going through it the more wraps,um the more wraps you you do around the rivet makes it so that it's stronger and theybe it keeps like a lot of energy going through it the more wraps you
9426,i did um my prediction was that ten would pick up half of its number and that did not happen,i did um my prediction was that ten would pick up half of its number and that did not happen
9427,yeah we did,yeah we di
9428,well whatever,on whatever
9429,um um it looked well here's the zero zero my axis um,um um it look well here's the zero zero riaxis um
9430,and sometimes uh there was both sides there was a wire and then on the end it was split into two so it would be like one battery over here and one battery over here,and sometimes on there was both sides there was a wire and then on the end it was split into two so it would be like one battery up here and one battery ovha
9431,yes,yes
9432,um no lines are the dots are where the line where it goes and so then that picked up three so it'd be,um mount lines are the dots are where the line where it goes and so then wenthat picked up threest it would be
9433,and then we picked up twenty,and mime picked up twenty
9434,um i don't oh what's um,um i don't oh what's um
9435,he's talking about the food tomorrow for international day,he's talking about the food tomorrow for international day
9436,here yeah and then thirty picked up seven it should be four five and six about here,here yeah and then thirty picked up seven it should be four five six about here
9437,um yeah we're going to make a telegraph,um yeah we're gonna make at tielograh
9438,i don't know why he keeps talking,i don't know  ht keeps talking
9439,um no wait yes i thought that the more wraps you had the more washers you would pick up,um no wait yes i thought that the more wraps you had the more washers you would pick up
9440,oh well i don't think i think i did that wrong i think it goes like this and then this one,i don't wl i don't think i think i did that wrong i think it goes like this and then this one
9441,here,here
9442,yes,yes
9443,um the energy went straight to e from the wire to the um the rivet,um the energy went straight to from the wire to the um the rivert
9444,yeah,yeah
9445,um you can't turn a magnet off but you can turn electromagnet off,um you can't turn a magnet off but you can turn electromagnet off
9446,well since we did ten wraps and it only picked up two it'd be like,well since we did ten wraps and it only picked up two it w'd be like
9447,um yes because it was wrapped around in a in a wire and it was kinda like a s a long stick,um yes because it was wrapped around and ain a wire and it was kind a like a s a long stick
9448,um that a magnet is actually made to pick them up and then when you have an electromagnet you have to do stuff to it to make it pick stuff up,um that a magnet is actually made to pick them up and then when you have an electromagnet you have to do stuff to it to make it pick stuff up
9449,um i think we're gonna use like everything that we've done already and to make it because um it cause all the time it just leads up to something bigger,um i think we're gonna use like everything that we've done already and to make it because um it cause all the time it just leades up to something bigger
9450,yeah,yeah
9451,he made um a robot that um does magic tricks,he made aum a robot that um does matric trics
9452,and it would probably be not even,and it would probably be not even
9453,um i think it seemed weaker um when we used one battery but when we used two it made it bigger,um i think it seemed weaker um when we used one battery but when we used two it made it bigger
9454,yeah that surprised me from the gap between ten and forty five yeah and we did it thirty times and that only got us seven so that makes really weird sense,yeah that surprised me from the gap between ten and forty five yeah and we did it thirty times  not only got ta seven so that makes really weird sence
9455,no we didn't have a switch,no we didn't have a switch
9456,of washers,oh washers
9457,a line point graph a line point graph,a line point grap a line point graph
9458,um because i thought it would pick up at least half of it's number like five except it just picked up two so it's,um because i thought it would pick up at least half of its number like five except it' just picked up to so it's
9459,the only thing that i can think of is like um uh uh uh at uh a junkyard where um they pick up like the cars and the metal things with the big magnet,the only thin that i can think it was like um a at a ad am a junk yard where um they pick up like the cars and the metal things with the big magnet
9460,um we had it hooked up to a battery,um we had to hooked up to a battery
9461,um i don't know because we we only practice with washers but a magnet did pick those up so,um i don't know because we we only practiced with washers but a magnet did pick those up so
9462,and then ten twenty thirty forty it actually did go up to fifty so,and then ten twenty thirty forty it actually did go up to fifty so
9463,um wraps,um wraps
9464,mmm hmm yeah,mm hm yeah
9465,um we had a wire connected to the battery that was wrapped around the rivet um and then the other side went back onto the other side of the wire went back onto the wire battery,um we had a wire connected to the battery that was wrapped around the rivert um and then the other side went back onto the other side of the wire went back on to the wire battery
9466,um we started making light bulbs light with a battery then we went into motors and then we made circuits and then we just started,um we started making light bulbs light with a battery then we went into motors and then we made circuits and then we just started
9467,and of course this wrap increased kind of more than what we did because it was ten and ten and ten and then this one did fifteen,and of course this wrap increased kind of more than what we we did because it was ten and ten and ten and then this one did fifteen
9468,um it's when you have a wire and an iron like stick sort of thing,um it's when you have a wire and an iron like stick sort of thing
9469,we read about he stopped um,we read about he stopped um
9470,next wednesday,mix onesday
9471,the graph yeah it was kinda built in like this and then it had ten twenty thirty forty and,graph yeah it was kinda builtin like this and when it  had ten twenty thirty forty and
9472,um he used his watch making skills and his magician skills,um he used his watch making scoles and his magition scoles
9473,stronger,stronger
9474,yeah we tried it with ten wraps and that us two washers,yeah we tried it with ten wraps and that got us two washers
9475,um not exactly but when we hooked the the last wire up to the battery it would work,um not exactly but when we hook the the last wire up to the battery it would work
9476,yeah but it depends on the m magnet size of course and the rivet size,yeah but it depends on the magnet size of course and the rivet size
9477,that's really weird,that's really w
9478,wrap it with wires and connect it to batteries and,wrap it with wires and connect it toho batteries
9479,that'd be like the first line,that'd be like the first line
9480,today we made an electromagnet yeah,today we made an electromagnet yeah
9481,um that the beginning it started off really small and then it got bigger and then huger,um that the beginning it started off really small bhan it got bigger and then huger
9482,it looked like like,it looked like like
9483,yeah,yeah
9484,they both pick up iron things,they both pick up iron things
9485,um what surprised me was that ten wraps would pick up only two,um what surprised me was that ten wraps would pick up only two
9486,um yeah i think he used an electromagnet because that's what what we read before we did the electromagnet so it's probably what he used,um yeah i think we used an electromagnet because that's what wha we read before we did the electromagnet so it's probably what we used
9487,wraps,wrap
9488,well becau we had a thousand ten but we also had this um cup that was a hundred so we used that too so i sorta you know,well because we had a thousand ten but we also had this um cup that was a hundred so we used that to so ize sorta yu know
9489,yeah because you know it's a hundred so you know it's gonna be right there but you'd have to do it ten times so yeah,you na because you know it's a hundred so you know it's gonna be right there but you'd have to do it ten times so yeah
9490,n mmm not really,not really
9491,uh one hundred milliliters fills up that,um  one hundred milliliters fills up that
9492,well it's it's it's the same thing as the other one except they just flipped up,well it's it's it's the same thing as the other one excect thy just flipped up mm
9493,thanks,thanks
9494,mmm not really cause we all had different bottles every group so not really mmm hmm,not really cause we all had different bottles every group so not really mm hmm
9495,well because the if you use the same size everyone would have the same answer basically unless one's wider,well because the if you used the same size everyone would have the same answer basically unless one's wider
9496,mmm hmm yeah uh huh yep,yeah uh huh yep
9497,well this is one milliliter this is one hundred milliliters and this is like a thousand so you can like see the huge difference between them,well this is one milliliter this is one hundred milliliters and this is like a thousand so you can like see the huge difference between them
9498,um i'm not sure how many times but,um i'm not sure how many times but

9513,well because we wanted to keep track so we w so we wouldn't like get confused so yeah that's,well because we wanted to keep track so we w so we wouldn't like get confused so yeah that's
9514,yeah cause i don't really think you could put the top in there anyways,yeah cause i don't really think it culd put the top in there  any ways
9515,yes no it doesn't look the same but it is the same because it's just that this is more taller and this is more wider but if you like if you like shrunk this into that it would be the same,yeah s no it doesn't look the same but it is the same because it's just sike this is more taller and this is more lighter but if you like if you like shrumke this into that it would be the same
9516,yeah,what
9517,mmm no i don't think so so it's just showing ten ten a hundreds would fit in a thousand,i don't think so i so it's just showing ten ten a hundreds would fit in a thousand
9518,yeah,yeah
9519,this well that's the fulcrum and it's the part where where you put the balance on like and it's where you get it like even,this l that's the ful grum and it's the part where where you put the balance on like and it's where you get it like even

10358,becau if it was something really heavy you would use a kilogram,because if it was something really heavy yot would use a kilogram
10359,mmm hmm nope put another gram that's good,m hmm nope put another gram that's good
10360,oh yeah sixteen um wait that's ounces sixteen ounces is a pound,oh yeah sixteen um wait that's ounces sixteen ounces is eigh pound
10361,level means that um this little bar is lined up with this thingie,level neans that um this little bar is lined up with this thi
10362,wow,well
10363,so say when i put the dry sponge in it's like this and another gram then another gram then another gram and now it's pretty balanced right,so say when i put the dry sponge in it's like this in another gram then another gram then another gram and now it's pretty balanced right

10371,the bigger s the big sponge would hold more water and it would weigh more when it's dry,the biggerst the big sponge would hul more water and it would weigh more when it's dry
10372,mmm hmm probably,m hm probably
10373,twenty we got,twenty we got
10374,well well you do you have a picture of it,well well you do you have a picture of it
10375,if i had anything at my disposal i would use a,if i had anything at my disposel i would use a
10376,well the soaked one would definitely be the most the dry one would definitely be the lightest and then and then the wet one would be just in the middle,well f the soaked one would definitely be the most the dry one would definitely be the lightest and then and then the wet one would be just in the middle of
10377,no not really you just look at it and guess,not really just look at it and guess
10378,well if we well we're we're we're um measuring weight in class so,well if we well we're we're we're um measuring weight in class so
10379,then take something lighter than an orange,then take something lighter than a oranghe
10380,not very heavy,not very heavy
10381,so if it's dry it's not gonna be very big wet it's gonna be a little bigger and soaked it's gonna be gigantic,so if it's dry it's not gonna be very big wet it's gonna be a little bigger in soaked it's gonna be jigantic
10382,no,no
10383,probably when you're doing like maybe a yogo or something uh,probably when you're doing like maybe ah u'll go or something uh
10384,yeah but if it's if it's too if it's like an heavy item you can go by fives or something like that,yeah but if it's if it's too if it's like an heavy item you can go by fives or something like that
10385,mmm probably not,probably not
10386,you you take out the grams one by one and count them it tells you how much to subtract from the wet sponge,you you take out the grams one by one and cuthem it tells you how much to subtract from the wet sponge
10387,i have no idea really i have no idea,i have no idea rea  had o idea
10388,and so we take the dry sponge and we put it in first and then we measured that out so we know how much to subtract from from the s s and then we,and so we take the dry sponge and we put it in first and then we measured that out so we know how much to subtract from from the sso and then we
10389,not really,not really
10390,maybe a little heavy,maybe little heavy
10391,maybe yeah it may be more than one kilogram,maybe yeah and maybe more than one kilogram
10392,no it was well it was cut out from a bigger sponge so so we a all our tables got different answers,nom it was well it was cut out from a bigger sponge so so we  all our tables got different answers
10393,no not much,no not much
10394,yeah because then if you put in like a twenty it can go like thunk or something like that,yeah because then if you put in like a twenty it can go like thunk or something like that
10395,no,no
10396,and then you put them put the grams in one by one again,and then you put them put the grams in one by one again
10397,yeah,yeah
10398,milligra i think there's these things called milligrams i can't remember but they're something bigger than a kilogram oh yeah,milligram i think there's these things called milligrams i can't remember but there's something bigger than a kilogram oh yeah

10403,and measuring anything no measuring how heavy it is,and measuring m anything no measuring how heavy it is
10404,yeah,yeah
10405,well when you have the wet sponge you weigh it until it's full and you know h that it's full when it when it stops getting bigger,well when you have the wet sponge you weight until it's full and you know h that it's full when it when it stops getting bigger
10406,dry sponge,dry sponge
10407,well if,well if
10408,hundred thousand wow,hundred thousand well
10409,and not kilograms kilograms are like one hun one on hundred grams or something i can't remember one thousand,and not kilogramskilograms are like one hun one one hundred grams or something i can't remember one thousand
10410,grams well there's different sizes of grams there are one grams which are bi about this big five grams which are about this big and then ten grams which are about this big this big,grams well there's different sizes of grams therere one grams which are abig about this big five grams which are about this big and then ten grams which are about this big this big
10411,when we use meter is like,when we use meter is like
10412,i don't know really i don't know,i don't know really
10413,well if you have this really heavy object you don't wanna go one one one one one one one,well if you have this really heavy object you don't want no go one one one one n one one
10414,hi,hi
10415,probably,probably
10416,yeah,yeah
10417,in the balance and then you measure it out with the grams,in the balance and then you measured out with the grams
10418,yeah,yeah
10419,um uh how much water is in that a dry sponge can hold,um how much water is in that a dry sponge can hold
10420,well we're trying to figure out how how much how much water a sponge can hold in grams so,well we're trying to figure out how how much how much water a sponge can hold in grams so
10421,there's like a billion centa centigrams in a kilogram so uh,there's like a billin cenacentgrams and a kilogram so
10422,and then you take a five and then another five and if it's too heavy when you put in the n another five you would take the five out and put in four little gram pieces,and then you take a five and then another five and if it's too heavy when you put in the  another five you'd take the five out and put in four little gram pieces
10423,um the,um the
10424,yeah,yeah
10425,so when you're measuring it out with the grams then when it's perfectly leveled you subtract um one or two of the grams from the sponge so then you know that's how much water,so when you're measuring it out with the grams then when it's perfectly leveled you subtract um one or two of the grams from the sponge so then you know that's how much water
10426,because it may be too much,because it maybe too much
10427,he light very light,light very light
10428,because maybe they they were cut unevenly,because maybe they they were cut un evenly
10429,centimeters,centimeters

10439,that you can mes that you can make it that you can make them the same by putting maybe something lighter but you can use more than one of those lighter things,that you can meas that you can make it that you can make them the same by putting maybe something lighter but you can use more than one of those lighter things
10440,like computers doors books,like computers dors books
10441,not that i remember,not that i remember
10442,no not really,no not really
10443,well it's a measuring thing it measure it measures what is heavier than the other,well it's a measuring thing it measure it measureds whane is heavier than the other
10444,no not really not so much,no not really not so much

11602,may you repeat that again,may you repeat that again
11603,i have been doing balances where you weigh something,i have been doing balances where you weigh something
11604,what you could do is you could look at all em and then get a balance and then weigh which one is heavier than the other,what you could do is you could look at all of them and then get a balanced and then way which one is heavier than the other
11605,it would make it non accurate because one is bigger and one is smaller so you would have to use more smaller ones to add up the bigler one,it would make it non accurate because one is bigger and one is smaller so you would have to use more smaller ones to add up to the bigger one

11608,one big paper clip and one small paper clip,one big paper clip and one small paper clip
11609,okay,okay
11610,because um when like animals die they're they're just their bones so then they eat all of that to break the bones down,because when like animals die they're they're just their bones so then they eat all of them to break the bones down
11611,it's because it's like the only food they eat cause just some people just are like kinda like a vegetarian so they just eat like you know,it's because it's like the only food they eat cause just some people just are like kind of like a vegetarion so they just eat like you know
11612,i don't know how to speak but kinda like a vegetarian,i don't know how to spak but kind a like a vegritarion
11613,i think they get their energy from when they eat bones and break them down,i think they get their energy from when they eat bones and break them down
11614,they ate all that paper and leave and when once they pooped it out it turned into soil,they eat all of that paper and leaves and twhen once they pooped it out it turned into soil
11615,i don't know what the word is but i think it's another word to describe it is like vegetarian,i don't know what the word is but thing is but another wored to describe is like vegetarion
11616,i think it just a consumer is all kind of all about eating to survive,i think it's just a consumer is all kind of all about eating to survive
11617,so we have a healthier planet,so we have a healphyour planet

11622,i think it's kinda like a vegetarian for some people,i think it's kind of like a vegetariam for some people
11623,makes them a decomposer,makes them a decomposer
11624,so they aren't all the same like some are vegetarian and some are meat eaters,o they aren't all the same like some are vegetarian and some are meat meaters
11625,it tells me not like us humans or carnivore or herbivores they don't eat that kind of stuff only decomposer eat that kind of stuff,it tells me not like us humans or carnivores or herbivores they don't eat that kind of stuff only decomposers eat that kind of stuff
11626,a plant like grows it's own food through photosynthesis kinda like a cycle or ecosystem and it's kinda like an evolution,a plant like grows its own food through photosynthess kind of like an cycle or ecosystem and it's kind of like voltion
11627,it's kinda like when we recycle and throw away trash,it's kind of like when we recycle and tthroug away trash
11628,i think it what it has to do is like um,i think  what it has to do is like
11629,animals get their energy from the producers from like eating and drinking and kinda like energy from the sun like just like producers maybe,animals get their energy from the producers from like eating and srinking and kind of like energy from the sun like just like producers maybe
11630,it's because they don't eat anything and they just make their own food so like the consumers could eat them,it's because they don't eat anything and they just make their own food so like the consumers could eat them
11631,they eat it all and then once they poop it out it turns into soil,they eat it all and then once they poop it out it turns into soil
11632,a carnivore is like the lion and the polar bear they only eat meat,a carnivore is like the line and e pol ber they only eat meat
11633,i think they eat um eat grass which is on the right of the top front picture,i think the um eagrass which is on  right of the top front picture

11640,consumer is like what it eats and like what their enemies eat them,consumer is like what it eats and like what they'r emnies eat them
11641,i think is what eats what,i think is what eats what
11642,they break down so it could turn into organic or soil,they break down soit could turn into organic or soil
11643,like humans and bears they eat meat and plants,like humans and bears they eat meat and plants
11644,good,good
11645,i notice all the trash and leaves have been shortened that means it took it days or weeks or maybe years,i notice all the trachion leaves have been shorten that means it took in days or weeks or maybe years
11646,they eat like all kinds of trash and what they return is they return nutrients to the earth,they eat like all kinds of trash and what they return is they return nnutrients to the earth
11647,that means it's an omnivore,that means it's an omnivore
11648,what is has to be it's kinda like um um killing others like this bear is eating a fish and probably the red tailed hawk eats like rabbits and birds,welt it has to be it's kind of like m killing others like mlike this bear is eating a fish and probably the red tail hawk eats like rabbits and bird
11649,there's herbivore omnivore carnivore and i don't know what the last one is,there's herbivore omnivore carnivore and i don't know what the last one is

11663,they get it from decaynah and decahnuh organ organic matter,they get it from decana and dcani organ organic matter
11664,get their energy from eating other they can't they can't eat themselves because and they can't make their own food so that's why they have to eat the other animals and they eat producers,s get their energy from eating other they can they can't eat theiselves because and they can't make their own food so that's why they have to eat other animals and they at producers
11665,it's not a producer or a consumer it's a decomposer,it's not a producer or a consumer it's a decomposer
11666,they eat it all and then they turn it into soil that's why they are a decomposer,they eat it all and then they turn it into soil that's why they are a decomposer
11667,i think that producers are the grass and the pinecone,i think the producers are the grass in the pine cone
11668,what it's all about because it breaks down here or digging um all organists of matter,what it's all about because it breaks down here or diin docary all organis of matter
11669,no they are not,no they are not
11670,i think why it's so important is just because um they return nutrients and we nutrients in our body,i think why it's so important is just because they ru turn nutrients and weth nutrients in your body
11671,i think what's to be a consumer is um to um eat other things they're not they don't they can't make their own food they have to eat other things to get their energy,i think what's to be a consumer is uto eat other ther things they're not they don't they can't make their own food they have to eat other things to get their energy
11672,when they return nutrients to the world like we kinda return nutrients to the cause we need nutrients in our body,when they return nutrients to the world like we kind of return nutrients to  cause we need nutrients in our body
11673,i think what it means to be a decomposer that it means it eats it and then it um returns nutrients to the earth,i think what it means to be a decomposer that it means it eats it and then it returns nutrients to the earth
11674,because they break down bones and also they can turn it into something new like soil just like worms,because they break down bones and also they can' turn it into something new like soil just like worms
11675,the decomposers are mushroom or fungi and bacteria,the decomposers are mushroom or fungi and bacteria
11676,i been learning about the food web also producers decomposers and consumers,i've been learning about the food web also producers decomposers and consumers
11677,it's a decomposer it eats decaying and decaying matter and returns nutrients to the earth,it's a decomposer it eats decaying and decaying matter and it turns nutrients to the earth
11678,i think what the lungs do is that um they give us oxygen and the main organ for breathing is in humans and so that's what i think about lung,i think what the lungs do is that they give us oxygen and the main organ for breathing is in humans and so that's what i think about lungs
11679,they uh bring in oxygen with exchange of the carbon dioxide,they bring in oxygen with exchange of the carbon dioxide
11680,what the lungs do is that once we breathe in it gets kind of fatter and bigger and once we go out it gets smaller,what the lungs do is that once we breathe in it gets kind of fatter and bigger and once we breathe out it goes smaller
11681,that um it's going through and through like i see like some circular things and it's going by from the heart and the capillary and others,that it's going through and through like  see like some circular things and it's going by the from the heart and the catap and others
11682,how they inhale and exhale is inhale is like once you breathe in from the nose which is the filter and then exhale is when you breathe out,how they inhale and x hale is inhale is like once you breathe in from the nose which is the filter and then x hales when you breathe out
11683,i think what it's all about is that it's showing how um where air goes in and carbon dioxide goes out in and out of your mouth or your nose,i think what it's all about is that it's showing how uwhere air goes in and carbon dioxide goes out in and out of your mouth or your nose
11684,what the respiratory system does is like it helps you breathe like when it it goes in and out of your lungs when oxygen goes in and carbon dioxide goes out,what the respiratory system does is like it helps you breathe like when t it goes in and out of your lungs when oxygen goes in and carbon dioxide goes out
11685,i see little circles like it's getting passed through like a system like the carbon dioxide is going out and oxygen is going in,i see little circles like it's getting passed through like a system like the carbon dioxide is going out and oxygen is going in
11686,doing good,doing good
11687,they're responsible for i think when carbon oxygen goes in and they're responsible for carbon dioxide to go out,they're responsible for i think when carbon oxygen goes in and they'e responsible for carbon dioxide to go out
11688,what the exchange of gases is all about is we survive with oxygen we can't survive with carbon dioxide cause that's kind of a poison oxygen to us,what the exchange of gasis all about is we survive with oxygen we can't survive with carbon dioxide ecause that's kind of a poison oxygen to us
11689,first of all we need to survive second of all um it's our only way of life to breathe,first of all we need to survive second of all  it's our only way of alive to breathe
11690,that would probably be oxygen,that would probably be oxygen
11691,the gas exchange is from those alveoli and um that's where um where the oxygen goes in and the carbon dioxide goes out,a gasicxchangement is from those aveo and that's where where the oxygen goes in and the carbon dioxide goes out
11692,i think it is e for lungs,i think it is e for lungs
11693,i think their behavior is safety because they don't want to be eaten when they are flying high in the air,i think they're behavior is safty because they don't want to be eatenn they're fling high in the air
11694,i'm doing good,i'm doing good
11695,this is a non learned behavior because they're hatching from their egg and they're they're already crawling out to sea,this is a non learne behavior because they're hatching from their age and they're they're already craling out to se
11696,the stimulus is because the skunk or the coyote has an adaptation the skunk has a,the stimulus is because uthe skunk r the coyote  has a abaptation the skunk hs
11697,so i think why so it could swim and like it could like it could like push it in case if like one of it's ducklings like comes falling behind,so i think  so it could swim and like it could like it could like push it in case if like one of it's duckings like comes falling behind
11698,he would probably attack for it or just run away,he would probably attack for it or just run away
11699,that the rattlesnake is rattling it's tail to say go away from me or else i'll bite,that the rattlesnake is ratling it's hiled to say go away from me or also bihte
11700,it's telling the person like once a snake's tail it rattles then it's about to attack the person,it's telling the person like once  snakes til it rattles then it's about to attack the person
11701,no,no
11702,like the reactions of people and animals,like the reactions of people and animals
11703,i think it's migrate behavior cause they're like not getting eaten,i think it's my greape behavior ecause they're like not getting eaten
11704,that they wanted to protect themselves from other predators,that they wanted to protect themselves from other predators
11705,like the flippers help em kind of like feet to swim and also the beak for like to eat like fish or something for like its food or something,like mthe flippers help tem kind of like feed to swim and also the bek for like to eat like fish or something for like it's food or something
11706,it's a not learned behavior,it's a not learned behavior
11707,that it could shoot a bad smell out of its tail,that it could shoot a bad smell out of its tail
11708,a cat is falling from a tree,a cat is falling from a tree
11709,it's pretty much marking its territory so predators can't eat it and also how one way they could defend themselves,it's pretty much marking it's  territory so m predators can't eat it and also how one way they could defend themselves
11710,i think it's a learning behavior because you are learning how to write your name,i think it's a learning behavior because you're learning how thoy right you'r name
11711,that he's telling the person to go away or else i'll bite you because he's trying to defend himself from predators like humans,that he's telling the person to go away or else obite you because he's trying to defend himself from predators like humans
11712,that the skunks tail is one of the adaptations because it shoots the smell out of it,that the skuns tail is one of the adaptations cause it shoots the smell out of it
11713,that they all have different reactions on different things,that they all have different reactions on different things
11714,because usually animals are scared of bright colors or predators are scared of bright colors,because usually animals are scared to bright colors or predators ore scare to bright colors
11715,like it's kind of like the same color as the ground and also the turtle can actually hide in its shell and also it can come in so no predators can get it,like it's kind of like the same color as the ground and also the turtle can actually highe it in its shell and also it can come in so no predators can get it
11716,that means what the reaction part is i would probably just go away from it,that means what the rreaction part is i would probably just go away from it
11717,i think it's a migration behavior because the black thing is stuck on the human's knee,i think it's a migrationl behavior because the black thing is stuck on the humans nee
11718,that like the dog wants to catch the frisbee and he is having fun and also the birds are flying together so they could be safe,that like the dog onces to catch the frizb and he's having fun and also the birds are fin together so they could be safe
11719,it's instinctive because it's reacting cause it's falling and he wants to land safely on the ground,it's instinctive because it's reacting because it's falling and her wants to land safely on the ground
11720,i think it's kind of like like a migration behavior,i think it's kindf like like  my craina behavior
11721,i think number two the teeth because that's how it chews the meat,i think number two the teeth because that's how it chews the meat
11722,i think it's the wings because it helps it fly away faster from the predator,i think it's the wings because it helps it fly away faster from the predato
11723,i think it's six because the houses the land the mountains the sky the trees and that little um blue grey brown thing,i think it's sicxk because the houses the land the mountains the sky the trees and that little um blue grey brown thing
11724,i see the water i see the atmosphere which is the sky i see the mountains i see some trees and some houses,i see the water i see the atmosphere which is the sky i see the mountains i see some trees and some houses
11725,i think the biosphere is made out of um probably trees and humans and animals probably just trees plants and animals,i think the biosphere is made out of um probably trees and humans and animals probably just trees plants and animals that's what i think
11726,the biosphere is probably all about life like trees plants and us like humans,the biosphere is probably all about life like trees plants and us like humans
11727,good,god
11728,i think they're just trying to survive not like to get eaten but probably the most dangerous ones are a snake a red tailed hawk,i think they're just trying to survive not like to get eaten but probably the most dangerous ones are a snake and a red tailed hawk
11729,well probably most animals go for probably bacteria mushrooms and um the others just go for like plants,ell probably most animals go for probably bacteria mushrooms and uthe others just go for like plants
11730,i think some yeah,i think some yeah
11731,it's kinda mostly in the same thing but it's mostly in the winter or like antarctica or like where mount everest is,it's kindof mostly in the same thing but it's mostly in the winter or like  artog or like where mountever it is
11732,i think it represents the climate or weather or like the temperature,i think it represents the claymate or weather or like the temperature
11733,what it needs is to survive is probably soil water air and sunshine,what it needs is to survive is probably soil water air and sunshine
11734,they don't get their own food they make their own food cause they're a producer and it makes it's own food through photosynthesis,they don't get their own food they make their own food cause theyi're a producer and it makes it's own food through photosynthesis
11735,they make it through their own photosynthesis,they make it through their own photosynthesis
11736,it kind of looks green but it it has sunshine and air but no water so that's why it's kind of like bending,it kinda looks screen but it it has sunshin air but no water so that's why it's kind of like bending
11737,i think all those cells like combine to make one whole like tiny grain of sand of yeast,i think all those cells like combined to make one hole like tiny grain of sand of yeast
11738,it's like what eats what and what eats them,it's like what eats what and what eats them
11739,when water sunshine and air and like all those combine together the roots go down into the dirt and then when which comes out is like a plant,when water sunshine and air re like all those combine together the roots go down into the dirt and then when which comes out is like a plant
11740,it's kind of like when you get like a sunburn like a human and it's getting all yellow cause it has no sun and it's not getting any green,it's kind af like when you get like a sunburn like a human and it's getting all yellow because it has no sun and it's not getting any green
11741,doing good,doing good
11742,they do not because because when it rains in the spring it gets water and then sunshine and then it gets air when it blows,they do not because because when it rains in the spring it gets water and then sunshine and then it gets air when it blows
11743,i think plants i read a book about this and it probably needs carbon dioxide which is kind of it's air,i think plants i read a book about this and it probably needs carbon dioxide which is kind of its air
11744,actually no because when i did my experiment in the bag we didn't use any water and it's and it's still growing on its own,actually know because when i did my experiment in the bag we didn't use any water and it's n it's still growing on it's own
11745,yes they do need it,yes they do need it
11746,yes it does,yes it does
11747,it's because they were all sickly and not healthy,it's because they were sickly and not healthy
11748,it wouldn't be a problem because like i just said it goes through it's own photosynthesis which it makes it's own food it can't eat anything,it wouldn't be a problem because like it just said  it goes through it's own photosynthesis which it makes it's own food they can't eat anything
11749,when we put the plants in the bag it had like a ton of air or carbon dioxide in it and that's why it needs to survive,when we put the plants in the bag it had like a tac air  carbon dioxide in it and that's why it needs to survive
11750,it has two out of three but not three out of three because they it needs water air and sunshine it can not be water air and no sunshine,it has two out of three but not three out of three because th it needs water air and sunshine it can not be water air and no sunshine
11751,i think it's trying to make some kind of signal or something,i think it's trying to make some kind of signel or something
11752,because it can't breathe any carbon dioxide and it's not breathing out any oxygen,because it can't breathe any carbon dioxide and it's not breathing out any oxygen
11753,i think it's kind of like plants like they need sunshine air and water,i think it's kind o like plants like they need sunshine air and water
11754,yes it would be missing three things sun water and air,yess it would be missing three things sun water and air
11755,how it relates to me is like it goes through it's own photosynthesis it needs sunshine water and air for it to grow,how it relates to me is like  it goes through its otopphotosynthesis an needs sunshine water and air for it to grow
11756,where food webs start will probably be at the producers because probably most consumers eat those producers,where food webs start will probably be at the producers because probably most consumers eat those producers
11757,they just stay in one place they don't move besides they make their own food through photosynthesis with the sun carbon dioxide and water,they just stay in one place they don't move besides n they make their own food through photosynthesis with the sun come carbon dioxide and
11758,think what it's trying to show is that sunshine reflects off the plant so it can,ithink what is trying to show is that sunshine reflects off the plant so it can
11759,because grass and the pine cone on the tree are producers and the plants are producers they make their own food which the consumers eat,because um grass iin the pine cone on the tree are producers and the plants are producers they make their own food which uthe consumers eat
11760,yes they do need it because it's kind of like what they need to breathe,yes they do need it because it's kind of like what they need to breathe
11761,what i just really think is just what eats what eats the producers consumers and the decomposers,what i just really think is just what eats what and what eats the producers consumers and the decomposers
11762,it's because it doesn't have any water,it's because it doesn't have any water
11763,i think light when it reflects so it helps it grow i think the water when you pour it so it stays healthy and the carbon dioxide which it breathes in and oxygen it breathes,i think light when it reflects so it helps it grow i think the water when you pour it so it stays healthy and the coorbon dioxide which it breathes in an oxygen it breathes
11764,i think they do because some animals eat them and that will protect them from animals,i think they do because some animals eat them and that will protect them from animals
11765,i think why is because there's no wind and there's just sunshine and water but it has to be complete with water air and sunshine for it to grow,i think hy i's because there's no wind and there's just sunshin and water but it has to be complete with water air and sunshine for it to grow
11766,it has water sunshine but no air,it has water sunshine but no air
11767,the sun,the sun
11768,no they do not need food because they they have they have their own photosynthesis which they make their own food,now they do not need food because they they have they have their own photosynthesis which they make their own food
11769,like some people say so it doesn't damage it,like some people say so it doesn't damage
11770,sometimes when consumers are eating them they'll have to put fertilizer around it so the animals can't eat cause if they eat it it'll kind of be like a gross taste,sometimes when consumers are eating them they'll have to put fertilizer around it so the animals can't eat it cause if they eat it kind of be like a grose taste
11771,it shows like a like a like a some kind of of drink that makes it grow food,it shows like a like alike asome kind of am drink that makes it grow foo
11772,it's because they do their own photosynthesis which they make their own food,it's because they do their own phoosynthesis which they make their own food
11773,it has all three things water air and sunshine,it has all three things water air and sunshine
11774,i think anything else to point out to me is like when the yeast kind of like rises from the bread except it gets it puffy for the air or carbon dioxide that flows in the bag,i think anything else to point out to me is like when the yeast kind af like rises from a bread except it gets it puffy for the ca like air or carbon dioxide that flows in the bak
11775,yes it can because if it doesn't have any sunshine it will turn like first day it will turn tan then it will turn yellow not green,yes it can be cause if it doesn't have any sunshine it will turn like first day it will turn tan that itill turn yellow not green
11776,it's all healthy and because it has all three things water air and sunshine,it's all helthy and nutri because it has all three things water air and sunshine
11777,what i observe is like little tiny particles inside the yeast when it's like kind of like mixed with the water,what i observe is like little tuny particles inside the yeast when it's like how like mixed with the water
11778,it's a house,it's a house
11779,what's important about producers is because they make their own food and once a consumer comes because they can't make their own food they have to eat something that's why they eat the producers,what's important about producers is because um they make their own food and then onces a consumer comes because uthey can't make their own food they have to eat something that's why they eat the producers
11780,that means it's a all and healthy plant,that means it's a all nutriated and healthy plant
11781,it's because they need light energy carbon dioxide and water so all those things so it can produce it's own food without those three things it can not grow,it's because they need light energy carbon dioxide and water so all those thrings so it can produce its own food without those three things it can not grow
11782,there is one of like parallel there is that is palmate and there's one that is parallel,there is one of like parallel there is one that is palmate and there's one that is parallel
11783,some examples are simple leaf parallel leaf and palmate leaf,some examples are simple leaf parallel leaf and palmate leaf
11784,i think the veins are for like they also use like the blood which it pumps in kind of like the human body's veins,i think the veins are four like they also use like the blood uwhich it pumps in kind of like the human bodies veins
11785,i've been learning about veins from leaves and from sap from trees and also some other stuff from science,i've been learning about veins from leaves and from sap from trees and also some other stuff from science
11786,one is called simple another is palmate and the third one is parallel,one is called simple another is palmate and the third one is parallel
11787,i think it comes from the air cause kind of like from the clouds it gives like water out once it rains so i think that's why,i think it comes from the air cause kindof like from the cloud it gives like water at once it rains so i think that's why
11788,it is the pattern of their veins and also the outside shape which it was born with,it is the pattern of their veins and also the outside shape which it was born with
11789,that tells me that it is a simple leaf,that tells me that it is a symple leaf
11790,i think it's a simple leaf because it's kind of like half and half and it's all parallel and it's kind of like the same on half,i think it's a simple leaf because it's kind of like half and half and it's all parallel and it's kindof like the same on half
11791,i think it is a simple leaf because it's veins are going kind of like a circular outside direction,i think it is a sympel leaf because it's veins are go ing kind of like a circular outside direction
11792,how it gets it's nutrients and that's getting out of it kind of like the carbon dioxide it's breathe i meant sorry the oxygen it's breathing out,how it gets its nutrients and the exliums that's getting out of i kind of like the mcarbon dioxide it's breathe i meant sorry the oxygen it's breathing out
11793,i think it was somebody that put a guy a bag and poured water in it or maybe it was just rain,i think it was somebody that put  got a bag and poured water in it or maybe it was just rain
11794,it is the air and water i see like particles of air and particles of water,it is the air and water i see like particles of air and particles of water
11795,like the phloem is like going down in the plant like it's nutrients and probably that kind of like the oxygen that's coming out of it,like the pholem is like going down in the plant like it's nutrients and probably xlian that like kind of like the oxygen that's coming out of it
11796,i am doing good today,i am doing good today
11797,that it has like different things like like the nutrients go inside and then something else goes outside of it,that it has like different things like like the nutrients go inside and then something else goes outside of it
11798,the esophagus it does that pushes all the food down into the stomach,the esophasgus it does that it pushes all the food down into the stomach
11799,mouth the mouth usually just chews it and swallows it,mouth the mouth usually just chowse it and swallows it
11800,oh it it pushes down all the chewed up food like it like those little bits so it could like fit through that kind of like little tube of the esophagus,oh it it  pushes down all the cube up food umlike it like those little bits so it could like um fit through that kind of like little tube of the esophagus
11801,i see,ise
11802,just to usually just to break down the food and once you're hungry you eat some so it won't go kind of like hungry for a little bit,just o usually just umbreak down the food and once you're hungry you eat some so it won't go kind like hungry for a little bit
11803,i think what's for the muscle cells is like they help your muscles grow or something or i think they'll help you move it,i think what's for the muscle cells is like i helps your muscles like grow or something or i think they'll help you move it
11804,they are probably made out of meat,they are probably made out of meats
11805,like in a digestive system it has to have like some kind of cells cause maybe like the saliva that's been in your mouth once you eat it maybe those cells kind of like break it down,like in the digestive system it has to have like some kind of cells cause maybe like the saliva that spin your mouth once you eat it maybe those cells kind o like break it down
11806,think the leaf has like a ton of,likeha leaf has like a tn
11807,there are like all sorts of cells and maybe they carry the nutrients for the arm so the skin's healthy,they're like all sourts of cells and maybe they carry the nutrients for the armso the skin's healthy
11808,doing good,doing good
11809,they usually just break down the food which you eat when you're hungry,they usually just break down the food which you eat when you're hungry
11810,i think what they are is like some kind of like nutrients that help the skin like stay like healthy and stays smooth,i think what they are is like usome kind of like nutrients that healp the skin like stay like healthy and stays smoothe
11811,it's trying to show me those brain cells,it's trying to show me those brain cells
11812,what the mouth does is once you chew it goes down into your body into the stomach,what the mouth does is when once you ho it goes down into your body into the stomach
11813,what i notice about it is a human body and i think it's pointing to certain things where the cells are for most important stuff,what i noticed about is a human body and i think it's pointing to certain things where the cells are for most important stuff
11814,i think the butterfly has cells because it needs some kind if thing like it like sucks up pollen,i think the butterfly hess because it needs some kind of thing like it like sooks a pol an
11815,what it tells me is like there's like huge cells and like there's less cells in a leaf because their all all the cells are in one section,what it tells me is like there's like huge cells and like there's less cells in a leaf because they're all all the cells are in one section
11816,i see all sorts of cells and i see some veins plus i see the skin,i see all sorts of cells and i see some veins plus um i see the skin
11817,it usually just usually just pushes it down into the stomach that's probably which i all know,it usually just usually just pushes it down into the stomach that's probably which i all know
11818,they are they are all sorts of cells,they athey are all sorts of cells
11819,they both drink,they both drink
11820,like it's kind of like all in the digestive system like all over your body like somehow it could like breaks it down or has a certain job to do for the whole body,like it's kind of like all in the digestive system like all over your body like somehow it could like breaks it down or  has a certain jop to do for the whole body
11821,i notice that what this is similar to them that they have cells,i noticed that what this is similar to them that they have cells
11822,i think what it's trying to show us is like once you eat it where it goes through and how like the steps where it goes through to break down all the food and then you pee it out,i think what it's trying to show us is like whwhence you eat it where it goes through and how like the steps where it goes through to break down all the food and then you peak it out
11823,i see like shapes kind of like a and maybe there will be all sorts of cells kind of like a to tell like messages to the body,i see like shapes kind of like af sparks and maybe there'll be all sorts of cells kind of like a moving to tell like messages to the body
11824,i think what the muscle cells are like they help your muscles move,i think what the muscle cells are like they help your muscles move
11825,i think they are because they both have blood inside of each other,i think they are because they both have blood inside of each other
11826,i think this was trying to show is kind of like the yeast is kind of like the skin of a human body,i think it's whats trying to show iskdo like the yeast is kdo like the skin of a human body
11827,but i also know is just travels all along with those cells like with the food how like side by side or like in a line or something,but i also know it's just travels all along with those cells like with the food to like side by side or like in a line or something
11828,that it has all cells because it's a living organism,that it has all cells because it's a living organism
11829,i think what those brain cells like they like send messages to the body like like tell the hand to move,i think what those brain chells like they like sen messages to the body like like tel the hand to move
11830,it's the gastric juice in the acid,it's he gastic juice in the acid
11831,the skin cells are for like your skin so they stay healthy,the skin cells are for like your skins so they stay healthy
11832,i think they're both different cells because they're not working for like like yeast cells are not working for human cells,ithey're both different cells because they're not working for like like yeast cells are not working for human cells
11833,i've been learning about the digestive system and also i've been learning about like how it works through your body,i've been learning about the digestive system and also i've been learning about like m how it works through your body
11834,it was important because they have to be good in have to put in good and if if they're not well done they can break,it's important because they have to be good in they have to put in good and if if they're not welle toene they can break
11835,i think what i would like to test is seeing seeing how far it goes and seeing the li the block can go be heavier,i think what i would like to test is seeing seeing how far it goes and seeing the little the block can go behavior
11836,i think it's,thank you to marnie
11837,we have seen a flipper system,we have o seen he fooper system
11838,good bye,goodbye
11839,you need a something to make it flip you need you need a stick and to measure it,you need uh something to make it flip you need you need a stick and to measure it
11840,i think you would just by um for example you can say the brook holds the stick in and it makes it and you measure it and it makes it go in,i think you would describe it by um for example you can say the brook colds the stick in and it makes it and you measure it and it makes it going
11841,it makes it a system because the propeller's spinning around,it makes it a system because the propeller's spinning around
11842,i think we haven't,i think we haven't
11843,we have been learning about flippers and we have been yeah we have been learning about flippers,we have been learning about flippers and we have been yeah we have been learning about flipers
11844,i think what you can change you can,to a heavierbl block to see if it goes farther
11845,i think what that is all about is measuring it and seeing how far it goes,i think what that is all about is measuring it and seeing how far it goes
11846,i think what's going on there it makes a good flipper system because it bounces off and it holds it tight and you don't want to bounce it off that high because the the stick can break,i think what's going on there it makes it a fper system because it bounces off and it holds it tight and you no one  bounce it off that hght because a bistic can break
11847,i'm very good,i'm very good
11848,you can also um do a smaller stick and see yeah you can do that too,you can also um do a smaller stick and to see tha you cand do that too
11849,when you click it it bounces off,when you click it it bounces off
11850,these are all about measuring how far the brook goes and seeing if it goes that far,these objects are all about measuring how far the broock goes and seeing if it goes that far
11851,i found out that you get you're measuring it and that you're seeing how far the brook goes and if it doesn't go that far you put the capacity you write the capacity and you,i found out that you get you're measuring it and that you're seeng how far the book goes and if it doesn't go that far you put the capacity youe reid the capacity and your
11852,um you can flip,you can do this experiment you can do
11853,um you can think of,um you can think of
11854,i think what the base is all about is measuring it and like seeing if it goes far,i think what the base is all about is measuring it and like seeing if it goes far
11855,i think what is up with that object would be um seeing how far it goes maybe,and i think what is up with that object would be um seeing how far it goes maybe
11856,um you can the block that holds the stick it can be smaller or it can be heavier,um you can the block that holds the stick it can be smaller or it can be heavier
11857,there is something on the on top of it and that you hold it you put it under the block and you just flip it and you see how far it goes,there is something on the on top of it and that you hold it you put it under the block and you just flip it and you see how far it goes
11858,it connects it by putting the stick on the bottom of the brick and if it goes far you just push it in you just take it out and it's and then just put it,it connects it by putting the stick on the bottom of the brick and if it goes far you just push it in you just take it out and it's and thenyou just put it
11859,spinning the rubberband around and seeing how how far it goes,i think it is all about
11860,systems are all about measuring and doing seeing seeing what how the system looks,systems are all about measuring and o wa saing seing what how the system looks
11861,what's going on with that is that we have to learn about pendulums we have to learn how to p how to do science and and to learn more things,wha's going on with that is that we have to learn about pendulums and we have to learn how to put how to do sciense and and to learn more things
11862,no some of them hold ten or nine,no some of them hold ten or nine
11863,very well,t's very well
11864,you can build them out of lifeboats you can build them out of wood,you can build hem out of life bulbs you can bild them ogt of wood
11865,learn about o,learning about all
11866,i i think i'm not sure i think you have to measure thirty centimeters on them and we learned how to how many pendulums that it can hold and how much water it can hold,i i think i'm not sure i think you have to measure thirty centimeters on them and we learned how to how many pendulums it it can hold and how much water it can hold
11867,about eleven and c could have ten and the shortest one could have eight,about eleven and c could have ten and the shortest one could have eight
11868,i think it could connect to the capacity of the boat would be we can just measure measure em and it can be eighty millimeters or sixty two millimeters thirty eight fifty five millimeters,i think it could connect to the capacity of the boat would be we can just measure measureing and it can be eighty millimeters or sixty two millimeters thirty eight fifty five millimeters
11869,bye,bye
11870,i've built mine out of pa out of paper cups,i built mine out of pa out of paper cups
11871,first you have to measure a the boat and see and put it in the water and you i think you measure thirty centimeters on them and then you'd need to,first you have to measure up the boat and c and put it in the water and you i think you measured thirty centimeters on them and then youwuld need to
11872,why i think they got a different number of pennies is because they cutted them shorter or longer,why i think they got a different number of pennieces because they cought it them shorter or longer
11873,i would think about putting pennies in it or water,i would think about putting pennies in it or water
11874,i discovered that the boat can fit twelve twelve pendulums in the little boat,i discovered that the boab can fae twelve twelve pendulums and in the little bulb
11875,when i when i noticed that a wasn't drowning that much i started putting more and more uh pendulums in em and when i drowned it i i got my answer really easily,when i when i noticed that a wasn't drouwning that much i started putting more and more pendulums in em and when i drounded i i got my answer really easily
11876,we have been learning about boats and we have been putting pendulums in the boats and seeing how many pendulums can fit inside the little boat,we have been learning about boats and we have been putting pendulums in the boats and seeing how many pendulums can fat inside the little boat
11877,we,we
11878,the lifeboats are all about you go you can go on a romantic date you can,um go to the river and get on then you can have a picgknack in them
11879,what is going on there is the propeller is the string is making it balance it and it keeps going around and around propeller keeps going around and around,what is going on there is the propeller is the string is micking it balanceig and it keeps going around and around the perple that keeps going around and around
11880,i think it will because it has to have more power on it and it has to go up farther and i think that would affect it,i think it will because it has to have more power in it and it has to go up farther and i think thayt would affect thit
11881,so it has also been nice talking to you marty,so it has also been nice talconed to you marnie
11882,what we've been doing in science we were we have been doing airplanes we have been seeing is the airplane propeller can fly,wel if we've been doing in science we were we have been doing airplanes and we have been seeing if the airplane propeller can fly
11883,thank you,thank you
11884,thank you,thank you
11885,i think when setting up your my experiment was it was tricky to put it together but it worked really well and,i think when setting up there my experiment was it was trickig to put it together but it worked really well and
11886,it's going very well marty,t's going very well marni
11887,you can also change the propeller you can use fishing you can use fishing wire and you can make the propeller smaller you can make the the,yeah
11888,you,you
11889,okay so how many spins it takes spins are forty five spins it made and the distance is how much meter how much meters you measure it,okay so how many spins it takes spins our forty five spins it made ind the distance is how much meter how much meters you measure it
11890,so what the parts of the plane i use the propeller is making it spin and the string the straw and the string is making it balance it,so what the parts of the plane are used the propeller is making it spin and the string the straw and the string is making it balance it
11891,i think the kinds of things that are important what makes if fly is the propeller makes it fly and that the string is balanced and a and that the straw is great is put good on it,i think the kinds of things that are important what makes it fly is a propeller mixes it fly and that the string with balanced and tha and that the straw is r is put good on it
11892,i think what that is all about it makes the propeller spin and if we don't have the rubber band in the bottom it's not going to work,i think what that is all about it makes the propeller spin and if you didn't have the uun n the bottom it's not gongna work
11893,you have to the propeller is all about making the propeller spin,you have to the propeller is all about making the propeller spin
11894,when it spins the thing on the bottom spins around too with it and m and then you measure how much far it went,when it spins the thing on the bottom it spins around twoo with it and im and then you measure how much far it went
11895,i think the number of swings isn't right because you ha also the string has to be balanced and the propeller has to be moving,i think the number of swings is right because you h also the string has to be balanced and the propeller has to be moving
11896,with string,string
11897,thank you,thank you
11898,marnie,barniy
11899,i think what is important about the flying line is because and it attaches to it and it makes it balance and if e you don't have it on the bottom it's gonna not go that fast,i think what is important about the flyng lime is because um it attaches to it and it makes it balance and if e you don't have it on the bottom it's gonna not go that fast
11900,okay,kay
11901,what you can also do when the parts are all working together is you can put the string into the straw and then you can just swing it across and it balance it and if it doesn't balance it's going to wiggle a lot,wel you can also do han the parts are all working together is you can put the string into the straw and then you can just swing it across and it balance it and if it doesn't balance i's gonna wa go up
11902,okay,okay
11903,i think that if the string isn't balanced that well it's not gonna work it's not gonna spin it's it's it's just not gonna work,i think that if the string isan't balanced thout well it's not gonna work it's not gonna spin it's's it's just not gonna work
11904,yeah that's it,the propeller on it and then you need to just stapel the two other other um
11905,i am very well how are you marnie,i am very well how are you marni
11906,i think the other things that are important when you are flying your plane is that it's really balanced and it's not wiggling a lot and that your propeller spins,i think the other things that are important when your flang an your plane is that it's really balanced and it's not when biging a lot and that you propeller spins
11907,i think the propellers are all about i am guessing that the propellers are to keep it balanced,i think the propellers are all about i am guessing that the propellers are to keep it balanced
11908,me too,me two
11909,um well maybe it's you have to put the airplane hanging attached to a string and you have to see how if it can fly,um well maybe it's you have to put the airplane hanging attached to a string and you have to see hw if it can fly
11910,bye it's been nice talking to you too,by it's been nice talking to you too
11911,i think how i might affect it is because the second one isn't really well done and if it goes up it's gonna go back down and the first one is gonna keep going straight,i think how it might affect it is because the second one isn't really well done and if it goes up it's gonna go back down and the first one it's gonna keep going straight
11912,i think it's balancing it and it's making the airplane fly,i think it's balancing it and it's making the airplane fly
11913,thank you,tank you
11914,the string was all about seeing how fast the airplane could h fly and the string,the string was all about seeing how fast the airplane could have lig and the string
11915,i think what that was all about was,i think what that was all about was
11916,it can stay a magnet as um for a bit longer than it can stick to the magnet but it loses its magnetism,it can stay in magneti um for a bit longer than it can stick to the magnet but it looses it's magnetism
11917,the magnet rubbing the nail will give some magnetism to the nail so it can pick up the paper clip,the magnet rubbing the nail gives some magnetism to the nail so it can pick up the paper clip
11918,they can go through thin objects and also they can connect to each other when they're off but the magnetism is so strong between the two magnets that it can pull through the table,they can go through thin objects and also they can connect to each other when they'are off but the magnetism is so strong between the two magnets that it can pull through the table
11919,this magnet that we're showing here has been connected cause the paper is very thin,this magnet that we're showing here has been connected cause the paper is very thin
11920,the magnet ca is lifting up the nail that is sending electrons to the to the paper clip,the magnet c is lifting up the nail that is sending electro the favorclip
11921,if you do not have the strongest magnetism in your magnet it cannot get through thicker things,if you do not have the strongest magnetism in your magnet it can not get through thicker things
11922,nail picked up the nail picked up the paper clip but then it lost its magnetism and then and then the magnet came back to give it more magnetism and it could pick up the paper clip again,nail picked up the nail picked up the paper clip but then it lost it's magnetism and then and then the magnet came back to give it more magnetism and it could pick up the paper clip again
11923,a nail has some magnetism in it to pick up the um the paper clip,the nail has some magnetism in it to pick up the um the paper clips
11924,the nail can only s um stay like a magnet so long because cause it does not it cannot keep as a magnet can the magnetism that stays in it forever,the nail can only s um stay like a magnet so long because cause it does not it cannot keep as a magnet can the magnetism that stays in it forever
11925,the nail is using magnetism to um keep the paper clip on it but the paper clip can only stay on so long cause the magnetism um wears off after a while,the nail is using magnetism to um keep the paper clip on it but the paper clip can only stay on so long cause the magnetism um weirs off after a while
11926,well magnets can stick to each other because they both have iron and they can attract because they're on different sides,well magnets can stick to each other because they both have iron and they can attract because they're in different sides
11927,the nail cannot always be a magnet and the magnet is always a magnet,the nail can not always be an magnet and the magnet is always amagnet
11928,the nail is not a magnet so it can't pick up the paper clip when it's not connected to the magnet,the nail is not a magnet so it can't pick up the paper clip when it's not connected to the magnet
11929,magnetism is when um the magnet can stick to things with iron in them,magnetism is when um the magnet can stick to things with iron in them
11930,it is picking up something with iron it just like the the magnet is doing to the nail,it is picking up something with iron it just like the the magnet is doing to the nail
11931,the nail is acting just like it can be in its own magnet because it is using the magnet's force,the nail is acting just like it can be in its own magnet because it is using the magnets force
11932,we've been learning about magnets,we've been learning about magnets
11933,i have put it through paper it has gone through some thin tables and also it sticks to all iron,i have put it through paper it is gone through some thin tables and also it sticks all iron
11934,magnets going through things can only go through certain things cause they're not as thick as other things,magnets going through things can only go through certain things cause they're not as thick as other things
11935,the paper clip can stay on the um on the nail for many times and falls when the magnet has no more magnetism in it in it,the paper clip can stay on the um um the nail for many times and falls when the magnet has no more magnetism in it in it
11936,the magnets both have iron in them and they're on the r the different sides so they are still attracting,the magnets both have iron in them and they're on the r the different sides so they are still attracting
11937,the magnets on the same time and the table thi is not that thin i mean it's not that thick so it mus they must have been pulling each other because magnetism,the magnets an ar te on the same time and the table  is not that thin i mean it's not that sthick so it mut they must have been pulling each other because the magnetism
11938,the paper clip is dropping off the nail because the magnetin magnetis magnetism because of many things,the paper clip is dropping up the nail because the magnetim magnetis magnetism because of many things
11939,bye,bye
11940,i know that magnets stick to iron,i know that magnets stick to iron
11941,if you rub the magnet on the nail it'll collect enough force so that it can pick up the paper clip,if you rubb the magnet on the nail it'll colec enough force so that it can pick up the paper clip
11942,if the magnet touches the nail then then it can come up and create its own magnetism,if the magnet touches the nail then then it can come up and create it's own magnetism
11943,magnet doesn't have enough force pick up the paper clip so the paper clip fell on the floor instead of going through like the thin piece of paper and connecting to the magnet,magnet doesn't have enough force to pick up the paper clips the paper clip fell on the flor instead of going through like the thin piece of paper and connecting to the magnet
